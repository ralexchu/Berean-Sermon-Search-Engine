[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   Turn with me to Romans chapter 15, 8, to verse 13.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.440]   We're going to finish up the sermon we started last week.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.840]   Romans chapter 8, verse 8 through 13.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.280]   "For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.280]   in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.860]   might glorify God for his mercy.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.640]   As it is written, 'Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing to your name.'
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.800]   And again it is said, 'Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.'
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.440]   And again, 'Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the people extol him.'
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.720]   And again Isaiah says, 'The root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.820]   Gentiles.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.740]   In him will the Gentiles hope.
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.120]   May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.680]   of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.'"
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.580]   Let's pray.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.360]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.680]   Thank you for the things that we are aware of, and even the things, Lord, that you are
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.260]   doing that we are not aware of.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.260]   We know, Father God, that you love us, that you're working all things together for good
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.500]   for those who have been called according to your purpose.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.680]   Help us, Lord God, to take our eyes off of what is happening around us, that we may give
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.520]   ourselves fully to you.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.440]   May your word bear fruit this morning.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.680]   The text that we're looking at this morning, as I mentioned, it started last week.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.660]   The first point of the message was that all that Paul has been saying about Christ and
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.860]   his sacrifice in chapters 1 through 15 is to prove his faithfulness, that God's salvation
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.140]   plan was not plan B. Paul mentions these various passages and is talking about how Israel is
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.600]   lifted up and is glorified to bring glory to God, and then the Gentiles and then the
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.180]   Israelites become one in praising God.
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.720]   And then we're now in a period where the Gentiles have taken the front seat, and then sometime
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.920]   in the future he's going to use the Gentiles to stir up jealousy among the Jews and then
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.580]   have them restored so that God's kingdom may be restored in proper worship.
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.960]   So that's what we looked at last week.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.340]   Before we get into the second and third point of this text, I can't emphasize enough how
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.860]   important this particular text is.
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.300]   And this is not to nullify all the other texts that we were in before, but as I mentioned,
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.100]   Romans chapter 1, he began the presentation of the gospel by basically trying to convince
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.540]   that there was a need for a savior because all have sinned and fall short of the glory
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.540]   of God.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.200]   So he's been systematically arguing the necessity of Christ and his sacrifice.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.020]   And then we get to chapter 9 through 11, we look at the history of how God's been working
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.700]   with Israel and what his plan is for them for the future.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.460]   And then chapter 12 through 15, the text that we're at, which is going to end in verse 13
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.260]   today, is the conclusion, not only of the imperative section from chapter 12 through
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.500]   15, but really is a conclusion of everything that he's been saying is beginning from chapter
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.660]   1.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.780]   So if you remember, he said that God's intent, he starts in chapter 1 by saying that all
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.460]   have sinned and then all are sinned and is condemned, whether you are under the law or
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.980]   not under the law.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:38.340]   Chapter 15, at the end of verse 13, ends with all will be saved, whether Gentiles or Jews.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.340]   Why this text?
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.780]   And obviously why this text is so important for us to understand is because this is the
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.780]   conclusion of what he's been trying to say.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.880]   We still have a chapter and a half to go where Paul is going to conclude his message and
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.980]   he's going to be a lot more personal about why he's coming there and he's hoping to get
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.660]   some support to get to Jerusalem.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.860]   But his main thesis is coming to a conclusion.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.820]   So if you've ever taken public speaking, you probably were taught that introduction is
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.380]   extremely important.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.820]   If you stand in front of people and you're trying to present something and you start
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.500]   out with the boring story or you go into your thesis and you just lose the people.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.740]   And so I noticed that whether it's sitcom or movies, they're all like that.
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.980]   It kind of starts with a bang.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.540]   So if you watch a movie, that big explosion to get your attention and then it kind of
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.420]   goes into the story and then it ends with some kind of a cliffhanger to kind of keep
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.380]   you hanging.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.960]   So whenever you're presenting something, whether it's from speech or cinema, you have to really
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.980]   pay attention to what's happening in the beginning and how it concludes because that's where
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.460]   the punch is.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.580]   That's what the writer is hoping that you'll understand.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.420]   So verse 8 through 13 is the conclusion of 15 chapters of Paul's dissertation of the
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.320]   gospel.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.920]   So if there's any text that you really, really should know, it's all the Bible, obviously,
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.240]   but then if you really need to focus on the book of Romans, you need to understand that
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.140]   this is what he's been leading us to.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.500]   Like I told you, I've been preaching on this for the last three years.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.300]   And three years of conclusion comes to this.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.680]   So again, I can't emphasize enough how important this text is.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.500]   The first point we looked at last week was that Christ's sacrifice proves God's faithfulness.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.400]   The text says in verse 8, "For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.580]   to show God's truthfulness."
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.200]   And the reason why he did that is that in order to confirm the promises given to the
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   patriarchs.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.180]   Again, that was our point last week, that everything God has done, it proves that God,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.860]   what he had promised in Genesis chapter 3, that all of what we study in Old Testament,
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.260]   New Testament is a fulfillment of that promise.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.180]   But that's not the end conclusion.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.720]   The end conclusion is not, "Well, God is faithful."
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.120]   God is a God that we can trust, which is true.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.180]   But the end, end conclusion we see in verse 9, "In order that the Gentiles might glorify
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.140]   God for his mercy."
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.640]   The point that he makes in verse 9 isn't one of many points.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.720]   This is the point.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.980]   This is the conclusion of the gospel.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:33.020]   So if you miss this, if you have a very loose understanding or application of this, it's
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.980]   kind of like running a marathon and you ran 25 miles and on the 26th mile you decided
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.620]   to go eat sushi buffet and then you never finished the race.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.060]   So you ran a great race, but you just didn't finish.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.800]   There's no prize waiting for you.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.620]   So you can understand everything about Christianity.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.620]   You can practice.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.420]   You can go on missions, do all of this.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.940]   And if you miss this, then you've missed the whole point of your salvation.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.740]   Not just the part, but the end conclusion.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.220]   Why he saved us to begin with.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.020]   So the second point that I want to convey, at least the title wise, that Christ's sacrifice
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.300]   restores proper worship.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.340]   Or if you want to say it another way, the end conclusion of the gospel is restoration
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.900]   of proper worship.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:25.420]   2 Corinthians 1.20 says, "For all the promises of God, find their yes in him."
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.800]   Talking about Christ and his sacrifice.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:33.140]   That is why it is through him that we utter our amen to God for his glory.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:39.420]   In other words, Christ fulfilled all the promises and because he fulfilled all the promises,
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.980]   it leads us to say amen to God for his glory.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.820]   It leads us to worship.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.500]   Worship is the end conclusion of our salvation.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.180]   It's not simply to keep us from going to hell.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.560]   In some circles, salvation is you're having a hard life and God's going to take away your
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.120]   sins so that you can have a better life.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.340]   Or you're having financial troubles and God's going to answer your prayers and it's going
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.340]   to be better.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.740]   You're raising children and God's going to answer your prayers so that your children
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.320]   would have a better life when they grow up.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.320]   That is not the point of the gospel at all.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.840]   In fact, some of us are sick because God wants us sick.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.960]   Some of us are poor because God causes us to be poor.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.000]   Some of us go through all kinds of trials, all for the purpose of causing us to become
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.080]   better worshipers because his end goal is not our health, is not our wealth, is not
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   our safety.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.600]   The end goal is worship of God.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:51.760]   So if making you wealthy hinders you from worshiping God, then the worst thing that
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.360]   can happen to you is to be wealthy.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.720]   If becoming healthy and strong causes you to be hindered in your worship of God, the
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   worst thing that can happen to you is to be healthy and strong.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.880]   God's ultimate end goal is worship.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.360]   That's why God says to Moses at the beginning of the nation of Israel, he tells Moses to
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:19.160]   go tell Pharaoh in Exodus 7, 16 and about 10 other passages where he repeats the exact
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.680]   same phrase, "The Lord, the God of Hebrews, sent me to you saying, 'Let my people go,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.640]   that they may serve me in the wilderness, but so far you have not obeyed.'"
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.160]   Now the word for serve here, some of your translation says worship.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.040]   The reason why it's translated worship because the Greek equivalent to that word serve here
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.000]   is the Greek equivalent, the word subomai.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.200]   And subomai, again in the New Testament, it means to serve in a physical sense, whether
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.760]   it's at the temple and other sense, physically to serve God as an act of worship.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.680]   That's what the word subomai means.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.920]   So God says repeatedly to the nation of Israel to go tell Moses so that you can be separated
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.280]   and be set free for the purpose of worshiping him.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:13.240]   That was the primary reason why they needed to be free, not simply to end their suffering,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.560]   not simply so that they can be free and be a great nation, so that they can be free to
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.020]   worship him.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.240]   If you remember in John chapter 4, he has a conversation with a Samaritan woman and
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.320]   they go back and forth and Jesus draws her out from her sins and she's kind of throwing
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.240]   up a smoke screen saying, "Well, you Jews worship there and we worship here and, you
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   know, like which is correct?"
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.920]   And Jesus says, "It doesn't matter one way or the other because what God is looking for
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.480]   are people who will worship him in spirit and in truth."
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.640]   You and I know, you've been a Christian long enough to know that worship isn't just something
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.080]   that you just check in and check out.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.640]   Worship requires much more than that.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.000]   In fact, it is central to our walk with God.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.960]   It's central to everything that we do.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.800]   You probably have heard this quote many times before, but I want to read it again from John
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.160]   Piper from the book, "Let the Nations Be Glad."
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.720]   And I want to read that quote for you because it pretty much sums up the point of the sermon
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.440]   this morning.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.040]   Missions is not the ultimate goal of the church.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.880]   Worship is.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.320]   Missions exist because worship doesn't.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.520]   Worship is ultimate, not missions.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   Because God is ultimate, not man.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.200]   When this age is over, the countless millions of redeemed fall on their faces before the
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.600]   throne of God.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   Missions will be no more.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.600]   It is temporary necessity, but worship abides forever.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.440]   I don't know about you, but when you read that out of context, and you say, "Well, John
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.640]   Piper said it, so it must be true."
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:00.920]   And so I hear this, like worship exists because, or evangelism exists because worship doesn't.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.320]   It's a great quote, and I've seen it on Facebook so many times, and I've heard you guys quote
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   it so many times.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.120]   But what does that mean?
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.600]   Other than John Piper said it, it must be true.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.560]   It's almost inerrant.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.360]   Where does this come from?
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.720]   So what I want to do this morning is look through the scriptures and find out where
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.760]   this is coming from, and why this is so crucial to not only understanding, but practice of
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.040]   our Christian faith, because this is the end goal.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.800]   The end goal is worship.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.000]   The word worship in English comes from a Latin word called "viar scipe," and literally it
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.200]   means to give worship, to give worth to something.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:52.800]   So by definition of this word worship, it requires a sense of adoration, because that's
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.840]   what the word worship means.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.480]   Only in our Christian circle, we've made worship something that we do Sunday morning.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.720]   You come, you clock in and you clock out, you give, you serve, and so that has become
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   worship.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.200]   But the general understanding of what worship is, is when you have given your heart, your
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.880]   time, your energy, your thought to something because you adore it.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.640]   So when you are obsessed with money, what do they say?
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.100]   You worship money.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:28.480]   If you are obsessed with Lakers, you're a Lakers worshiper.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.360]   You worship Kobe Bryant, you worship this, you worship travel.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.560]   And we use that to describe something or someone who is completely given.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:44.700]   You're so enamored by an individual or product or money, whatever it may be.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:50.760]   Because the very definition of the word worship means that you give supreme value to that
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.200]   which you are worshiping.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:01.120]   So by definition, worship is not something that we do from determination, but worship
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.240]   is something that we do from inspiration.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   Let me say that again.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.040]   By definition of the word worship, worship is not something that you do from determination.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.140]   It is something that you do from inspiration.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:20.000]   Because it requires not simply your physical activity, but your adoration.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.520]   That's why the scripture says the greatest command is to love the Lord your God with
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.760]   all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.780]   And it's another way of describing the command to worship Him and to Him alone.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:36.780]   To give the greatest value to God and God alone.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:44.540]   So the very definition of worship requires us to be enamored by Him.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:51.560]   Not just to say, "Yeah, you know, He's valuable," or to be marginalized.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:57.860]   Everything that we do is to come before God and to see who He is.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.320]   And it inspires us to worship.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.660]   And that's why He says everything that He has done to fulfill His promise in order that
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.740]   the Gentiles might glorify God for what?
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.480]   For His mercy.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:19.260]   The point of the cross, the end product of the cross is worship.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.640]   Is not simply freedom from condemnation.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.820]   We were freed from condemnation that we may enter the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.920]   Because with sin, you can't enter to worship.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.820]   It wasn't just you're freed from sin to go do whatever you want.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.240]   You're freed from sin so that you can come and fellowship with God for the purpose of
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.780]   worship.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.660]   And you're going to hear me say that about a hundred times before this sermon ends.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.100]   Because it is that crucial.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.500]   It is central to our understanding of our salvation.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.540]   I want you to turn your Bibles with me to Revelations chapter 4.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.260]   And I know the passage is going to be up here and you can look at that.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.440]   But if you have your physical Bibles, turn with Revelations chapter 4, 1 through.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.200]   And I'm just going to give you a heads up that we're going to be reading chapter 4 and
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.780]   all of chapter 5.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.820]   Okay, well most of it.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:16.100]   And the reason why I'm doing that is because again, I want to emphasize the importance
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.860]   of this point.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:24.740]   Revelation chapter 4 is the beginning of the revelation that God is giving to John about
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.820]   the redemptive plan of God that's going to unfold through these three specific visions
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.180]   of the seal judgments, the trumpet judgments, and then the bowl judgments.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:39.940]   And through these specific visions, it's basically outlining God's redemptive plan.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.900]   Whether it is past, present, or future.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:49.780]   But before he begins this vision, he takes John up and he shows him the throne of God.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.460]   And this is what he sees.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.060]   And I'm going to start reading from verse 3.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.660]   And he who sat there and had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.000]   was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.080]   Around the throne were 24 thrones, and seated on the thrones were 24 elders, clothed in
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.200]   white garments, with golden crowns on their heads.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.680]   From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.520]   And before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.600]   And before the throne there was, as it were, a sea of glass like crystal.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   And this goes on and on and on.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.000]   Now we can go into like, what are the crystals?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   What do they represent?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   What does the thunder represent?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.840]   And all of that.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.960]   But the point that I want to make here is not to tell you what all of these glasses
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.960]   and crystals mean.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:44.760]   Other than the fact that when John saw the image of the throne, he saw something majestic.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.480]   And so every little detail, instead of scrutinizing what it means, is for us to take a step back
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.360]   and look at this majestic picture that John sees.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.800]   And he's doing his best to describe the details, but what we are to see is the big picture.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.280]   It's God's majesty that he's describing.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.480]   And he says, "And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.600]   full of eyes in front and behind.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.760]   And the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.980]   third living creature like a face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.680]   in flight.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.360]   Four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within,
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:28.480]   and day and night they never cease to say, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.320]   who was and is and is to come.'"
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:38.440]   This is the same vision that Isaiah saw in Isaiah chapter 6.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   As he was being prepared to be the spokesperson for the nation of Israel, God opens his eyes
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.200]   to see the throne, throne of God, and he sees these creatures surrounding, and what's happening
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.880]   is worship.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:19:00.600]   24/7, these holy creatures are in his presence, worshiping God, "Holy, holy, holy."
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.240]   And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who's seated on
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.760]   the throne, who lives forever and ever, the 24 elders fall down before him who is seated
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.160]   on the throne, worship him, who lives forever and ever.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.760]   They cast their crowns before the throne, saying, "Worthy are you, our Lord and God,
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.240]   to receive glory, honor, and power, for you created all things, and by your will they
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.000]   existed and were created."
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.600]   You see how in their worship, what is the first thing that they say?
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.160]   You are worthy.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.600]   And that is, again, the very definition of the word worship is to give the highest value
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.440]   to the object that you are worshiping.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:48.800]   And so these elders who are crowned representing kings, they lay it down in surrender before
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.520]   something greater than them, and so the whole throne, the vision that John sees, is this
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.960]   vision of all-inspiring worship.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.120]   But this scene of heaven doesn't end here.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.140]   If you notice, something is missing in chapter 5, or chapter 4.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.600]   You and I are not there.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.840]   This vision of God, these holy creatures who are surrounding him in worship, as majestic
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:27.240]   as it is, the complete picture is shown in Revelation chapter 5.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.720]   Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.320]   and on the back, sealed with seven seals, and I saw strong angels proclaim with a loud
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.680]   voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seal?"
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:47.360]   The scroll he's referring to, he records redemptive history, from the need for Christ, the judgment,
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.080]   and the restoration, and that's what the seal represents, and he says, "Who," again, that
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   word "worthy."
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.760]   "Who is worthy, who is of value to be able to open this?"
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.560]   And no one in heaven or on earth, or under the earth, was able to open the scroll or
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.280]   to look into it.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.400]   And he began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.240]   look into it.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.560]   Despair.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.840]   And this is the description that John gave, or Paul gave, in Romans chapter 1, 2, and
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.440]   3.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.240]   That this is the state of mankind, that no one is worthy.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.920]   And there's sadness, there's darkness.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.240]   The sin reigns over mankind and they have no power over it.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.840]   And so they said they are weeping, and in verse 5, "And one of the elders said to me,
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.040]   'Weep no more.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.820]   Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.080]   open the scroll and the seven seals.'"
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.360]   He says, "Weep no more, we have hope.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.960]   The Lion of Judah," remember we talked about that last week, the Root of David, not the
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:52.080]   Fruit of David, but the root that upholds David has come and he has conquered.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.360]   We have hope.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.040]   Stop crying.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.360]   And then when they look to see this Lion, what do they see?
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.880]   "Between the throne and the four living creatures, among the elders, I saw the Lamb standing,
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.320]   as though it had been slain, with seven horns, with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.540]   of God, sent out into all the earth."
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.880]   And this is where you've heard the phrase, "The Lion of Judah coming as a lamb to be
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.880]   slaughtered."
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.580]   It comes from the second, one of my favorite passages in the Bible, because you see this
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:27.820]   strong lion figure who had every right to reign and receive glory, gives that up and
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:35.420]   he appears as a lamb who is slain, all for the purpose of redeeming sinners.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.180]   And as a result of that, verse seven is that, "He went and took scrolls from the right hand
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.220]   of him, and who was seated on the throne.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.860]   And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and twenty-four elders fell
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.980]   down now before the Lamb."
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.340]   As they fell down before the throne of God, now before the Lamb, they all fall down and
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:58.820]   bow in worship, each holding a harp, golden bowls of full incense, which are the prayers
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.280]   of the saints.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.380]   The prayers of the saints are not mentioned in chapter four.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:12.180]   The Lamb, because of his sacrifice, he begins to involve us in worship, and in verse nine,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.740]   "And they sang a new song."
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.900]   What does he mean by a new song?
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.120]   A song that didn't exist before.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.380]   They added this new song because of his mercy.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.020]   God was receiving glory.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.280]   It was a majestic scene.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.640]   Even the holiest of creatures were bowing down in reverence and honor.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.700]   But because of Jesus' sacrifice and his mercy, the prayers of the saints arise and we all
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.620]   participate in the singing of this new song.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.220]   And what is the basis of this new song?
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.780]   It's the gospel.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.460]   "Blessed are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you are slain, and by
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:59.980]   your blood you ransom people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:07.060]   And you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth."
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:12.440]   We didn't exist in chapter five, at least chapter four in worship, but in chapter five,
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.740]   because of what Christ has done, we become vital parts of this worship.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.940]   In verse 11, "Then I looked and I heard around the throne the living creatures and the elders,
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:25.860]   the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands upon thousands, saying
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.940]   with a loud voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.780]   wisdom and might and honor, glory and blessing.'
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.440]   And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.500]   all that is in them saying, 'To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.180]   and honor and glory and might forever and ever.'
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:54.680]   And the four living creatures said, 'Amen,' and the elders fell down and worshipped."
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.660]   This is where we are headed.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.080]   This is why he saved us.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.300]   This is what he's trying to restore.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.900]   When we think of heaven, we think of all the wildest dreams that we couldn't fulfill on
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.980]   earth.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.540]   So if you're short, when you're in heaven, you're going to be tall.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.540]   If you're poor, you're going to be rich.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.460]   If you have a small house, you're going to have a mansion.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.580]   If you're unathletic, you're going to be a star player.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.060]   And we imagine that whatever dreams that we couldn't fulfill here is going to be dreamt
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.500]   and fulfilled in heaven.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.020]   That is not how the Bible describes heaven.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:38.300]   The Bible describes as a place where we are, we join the hosts and angels to worship God.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.020]   That's where we're headed.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:47.860]   What you and I could not do because of our sins, Christ transforms that so that we can
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.140]   draw near to him.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.620]   Why does he tell us to draw near to him?
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.220]   It's not because your life is hard.
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.980]   It's not because without him, I have some illness that only God can fix.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.340]   I need to draw near to the throne of grace.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.980]   Does it mean that God doesn't care about all of that?
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.820]   Of course he cares about all of that.
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:16.580]   When Israel was called to draw near to the tabernacle, what was it for?
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.900]   Was it because of your illness?
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.820]   Was it because you didn't have enough money?
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.780]   When God told Israel to come to him, what was it for?
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.200]   To worship him.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.780]   So when the scripture says that the gates of heaven has been opened to enter the throne
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:40.620]   of grace to draw near to him with confidence, it is a call to worship what you and I could
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:46.580]   not do in our sinful state.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.300]   Everything that we do is for the purpose of restoring God.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.700]   It's not about you.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.420]   And it's not about me.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:01.740]   Now some of us may look at that and say, "Well, that sounds unfair."
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.660]   In any other context, if we say we glorify something, we mean we exaggerate.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:13.180]   Only in the context of God do we see that that's orthodox and necessary.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.900]   Everything that he calls us to do is for the ultimate purpose of worship.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.460]   But you have to understand it in the context of who we are and who he is.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:31.540]   God created us not to be the object of worship, but to be worshipers.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.740]   And that's what was broken when we sinned.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:40.060]   Instead of worshiping God, Romans chapter 1, it says we refused to worship him and we
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.080]   decided to worship the images made by human hands, ultimately to put us at the center
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.100]   instead of God.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.500]   And ultimately, that's human rebellion.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:55.660]   Instead of putting him as Lord, even sometimes in the church, we use him so that we could
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.860]   live.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.660]   It goes against everything about what the gospel teaches.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.500]   Paul himself says in Philippians chapter 3, 2 to 10, again, this is another passage that
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.380]   you know very well.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.580]   Look out for those dogs.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.740]   Look out for the evildoers.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.420]   Look out for those who mutilate the flesh, for we are the real circumcision.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   Look at what he says.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.920]   Who worship God, who worship by the spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.920]   confidence in the flesh.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.500]   In other words, Paul is saying those guys think that they're worshiping God because
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.620]   of their circumcision, because of their background, because they're Jews and obeying the law.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.740]   All they are doing is mutilating their flesh.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.500]   In other words, it's sacrifice for no benefit.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.920]   We are the true worshipers, talking about Christians.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:47.420]   But in verse 4, if you want to go head to head, if you're going to nullify me saying
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.580]   that, oh, maybe Paul is saying that because he wasn't an obedient Jew.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.340]   He says that's not the reason at all.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.580]   Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also, if anyone else thinks he
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:02.500]   has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.340]   Circumcised on the eighth day, a people of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews,
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.780]   as to the law of Pharisee, as to zeal, a persecutor of the church, as to righteousness under the
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.900]   law blameless.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.820]   Paul was not exaggerating when he says this.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.620]   That's exactly who he was.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:24.300]   Paul either was already sitting in the Sanhedrin or he was very close to sitting in the Sanhedrin.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:30.220]   He would have basically been one of the 70 senators of a whole nation of Israel.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.100]   He was a Jew among Jews.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.640]   He was a Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.180]   He kept the law in his own recognition perfectly.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:45.460]   So if you think that somehow that is going to cause you to be a better worshiper, and
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.460]   the reason why I'm going against that is because I wasn't a faithful Jew, that's not the reason
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.460]   at all.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:57.020]   Verse 7, "But whatever gain I had," and again, he's not talking about the world versus Christ.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:03.860]   He's talking about Jews who are obeying the law, who are disciplined, who are sacrificing.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:09.020]   "Whatever gain I had, I count as lost for the sake of Christ.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:16.700]   Indeed, I count everything as lost because," and here's the reason, "in comparison to all
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:24.500]   the work that he did to be worshiper of God," he says, "I counted all as lost the surpassing
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.100]   worth of knowing Jesus Christ my Lord."
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.940]   So all the work that he did to be a good Jew, to be a good worshiper, in light of meeting
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.220]   Christ, it became nothing.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.220]   It became rubbish.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.740]   Now I want you to think about that.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:50.980]   The very definition of worship requires inspiration more than determination because it requires
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:56.900]   your heart, it requires your devotion, it requires love.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.180]   God is not calling us to people who didn't come to church to come to church.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.700]   If you somehow read the Bible more than the other people, that if you sacrifice more,
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.780]   if you gave more, if you evangelize more, that you are a better worshiper.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:16.660]   Better worship begins when we are giving the highest value to God.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.180]   And so that's what Paul is saying.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:24.060]   With all the effort that he made to keep the law in comparison to when he met Christ became
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.700]   rubbish.
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.420]   Because he completely got transformed.
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:33.940]   That's exactly how the Bible describes non-Christians where the God of this age blinds the minds
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.660]   of the unbeliever so they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:44.580]   Because when they are exposed to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, they are changed,
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.940]   they are saved, they become new creatures.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.860]   So he doesn't say he blinds them so that they are immoral and they do bad things.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:58.820]   He says no, what initiates all of that is they do not see or understand the glory that
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.760]   is in Jesus Christ.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:09.120]   And that's why he says he was faithful to prove his faithfulness to Israel but in order
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.800]   that the Gentiles might come and give glory for what?
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.440]   For his mercy.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.880]   The purpose of the gospel is to restore proper worship.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.080]   And the reason why we evangelize is to bring people who have been separated from God so
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.140]   that they may worship.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.200]   Not people who didn't go to church to come to church.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.680]   The purpose of it, people who didn't read the Bible to read the Bible.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.480]   People who weren't generous to become generous.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.560]   All of these are byproducts.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.160]   But the end goal is proper worship.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.640]   You notice here Paul says in verse 7, "But whatever gain I had I counted as loss for
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.640]   the sake of Christ.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.040]   Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.880]   Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered loss of all things.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.480]   I count them all rubbish in order that I may gain Christ."
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:06.880]   Not only does he see Christ, not only does it transform him to be a better worshiper,
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.960]   that's all he wants.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.880]   Even if it means for him to die.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.600]   He saw the worth of Christ in verse 10, "that I may know him and the power of his resurrection
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.960]   and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, by all means that he may
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.480]   be a better worshiper."
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:35.320]   Paul is describing a man who is separated from God because of his sin and is properly
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.640]   restored to worship.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.040]   And that's what worship looks like.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.880]   Worship isn't simply because we're determined.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:51.780]   When we see the glory of who Christ is, you can't help to be changed.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:34:00.160]   If you see Christ and then you place that on all the temptations in the world, the only
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.520]   thing that can save you from the temptation of the world is because you saw the glory
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.000]   of Christ and that was better.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.880]   And the world became rubbish in light of that.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.320]   But if you don't see the glory of the gospel, you don't see the glory of his mercy, how
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:25.080]   will you fight the temptation to want to rest, to want to have nice things, to want to find
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:30.200]   peace, want to have all the things that the world is offering, all the things that the
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:36.960]   world is tempting, and you just are determined, "I'm not going to do it."
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.160]   And yet everything in your heart wants that.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.160]   You can't take your eyes off of that.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.140]   You're dreaming about it.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.140]   You're working for it.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:50.080]   You're saving up money to get more of it.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.200]   And then you come to church and then you're determined, "I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   I'm not going to do it."
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   How long will that last?
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.760]   There's a reason why the Bible says, "Don't make promises."
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.440]   You have no idea how strong your flesh is.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:12.500]   The only power to save us from our sins is the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:20.560]   And that is why the goal of our salvation is Christ.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:30.600]   Not just to dabble in Christ, not just a marginalized version of Christ, but to be so consumed as
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.880]   Paul is sitting in prison saying, "I'm willing to die if I get more of Him.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.460]   I'm willing to suffer if I can have more of Him."
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:44.580]   He was tempted with Christ and everything else became rubbish in light of that.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.300]   That's a picture of a true worshiper.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:52.320]   Knowing Jesus was more important to him than anything else.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.260]   And all that effort that he put in light of knowing Jesus was nothing.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.600]   That's why Jesus says at the end, He's going to separate those people and say, "Well, when
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   were you in prison?
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.160]   When were you sick?"
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:12.200]   And the way Jesus describes the unbelievers, He says, "I never knew you."
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.840]   That's how He describes an unbeliever.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.480]   "I didn't know you.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.960]   You didn't know me.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.220]   I didn't know you."
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.280]   Salvation is described as a relationship with Christ, as cliche as it is.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.140]   See, that's why it says in Isaiah 48, verse 9 through 11, "For my name's sake, I defer
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.140]   my anger."
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.040]   In other words, I show my mercy.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:39.080]   "For my name's sake, for the sake of my praise, I restrain it for you that I may not cut you
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   off.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.880]   Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.560]   I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:50.680]   For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it for how should my name be profaned.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:55.480]   My glory I will not give to another."
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.600]   We may look at that and say, "Well, God is egotistical.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.500]   He tells us to be humble, not to be self-centered.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.660]   And yet, when He describes Himself, He says, "I will not share my glory to another.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.380]   Everything I do for my name's sake."
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.420]   In every other instance, when we say glorify, we mean to exaggerate something.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:22.020]   But when we say we glorify God, we basically mean to display who He is.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:31.980]   And the reason why only God, only God of all beings that have ever been created, only God
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.100]   was meant to be the object of worship.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.540]   Everything else that God created was for the purpose of giving worship.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.780]   Whether it is the earth, whether it is the galaxy, whether it is the oxygen, the water,
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:50.460]   the animals, the plants, and in particular, human beings that He made in His own image
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:56.220]   and put His own breath in, our whole existence was for the purpose of giving Him the glory.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.740]   We were His image bearers.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:07.180]   Nothing and no one else was made for the purpose of being worshipped.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:12.840]   At the core of human rebellion is wanting attention.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.220]   The way we dress, what we buy, what car we drive, why we work so hard, why we move into
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:27.420]   big homes, why we do everything that we do, if we're not careful, flies exactly the opposite
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.260]   of God's intention.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.540]   We want to be better.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.800]   We want to move higher.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.860]   We want to be recognized.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.920]   So we study.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.260]   We work.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.420]   We sacrifice.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:48.740]   All with hidden hope to touch some of that glory.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:55.500]   And the end result leads to nothing but condemnation.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.300]   God created us for the purpose of worship.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:09.180]   The greatest damage that sin has done is that we couldn't worship.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:21.980]   Why do people, why do you and I pay hard-earned money to go to places and see things that
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.340]   are beyond you?
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.860]   People don't pay money to see middle-aged men play basketball.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.380]   No one is inspired.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.220]   Nobody.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:39.020]   You watch them play and the first thought you have is, "I could probably do better than
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.020]   that."
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.020]   That's the thought.
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.100]   So naturally, you're not inspired.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:49.020]   You pay money to watch guys who are beyond your height, beyond your ability.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.440]   They're jumping beyond your imagination.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.020]   They're shooting through the ball like a magician.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:59.820]   I mean, it's just, whatever it is, it is beyond you.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.860]   And you're floored by it.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.620]   You're awed by it.
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:07.500]   Nothing as trivial as basketball or baseball because these guys are fantastic.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:12.420]   You happen to like baseball and these guys hitting a 95 miles per hour, you know, fastball
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.820]   down the middle and hitting a home run.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:19.940]   It's like, wow, because in your wildest imagination, that will never happen in your life.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.020]   Why do you pay money to travel to places where you have huge mountains and huge bodies of
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:29.180]   water to make you feel small?
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.180]   Why do we do that?
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:37.700]   Why do you feel alive when you're in the presence of something majestic that you can't possibly
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.380]   fathom imitating in any way?
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.500]   Why do you pay money to be there?
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.340]   Why do you go and travel to far distant places so that you can just be in the presence of
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:51.740]   something beyond you and just be awed and that's it, and take nice pictures and put
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.500]   it on Facebook?
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:00.540]   Why does all of that make you happy?
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:06.340]   Because at the core of who we are, God created us to be worshipers.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:13.300]   And we feel alive worshiping trivial things.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.260]   We're too easily amused.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:21.540]   And Satan works hard to imitate his glory.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:31.380]   And the world is easily amused, easily distracted, giving glory to man's creation rather than
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:36.780]   the God behind that.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:41.820]   That's what salvation ultimately is.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:49.500]   No amount of talking, no amount of convincing, no amount of hard work would have saved us
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:57.060]   from the temptation of this world, from this imitation that Satan has created around us.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:06.140]   Only a direct gaze at his beauty, only in the presence of his glory will everything
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.820]   else look rubbish.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.580]   There is no man.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.580]   There is no system.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.180]   There's no amount of money.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.540]   There's nothing that human beings have created.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:25.740]   No amount of human determination will separate us from this temptation other than the glory
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:30.020]   of the mercy of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:35.700]   I've been a Christian for over 30 years, and I'm amazed even to this day, studying through
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:42.940]   Revelation and Leviticus and various parts of the Bible, how little I knew of his mercy.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.260]   I knew some.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.920]   I knew bits and pieces.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:53.780]   But every time I open the Bible, I see puzzles coming together.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.340]   And it just floors me.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.740]   I knew this, but I didn't really know.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:05.820]   I've been talking about the love of Christ, but I've only been going an inch deep.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:13.180]   I knew that he was merciful, but I didn't understand to what degree.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:21.100]   I knew I was sinful, but I didn't understand how deeply corrupt my heart was.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:27.980]   And the more I dig, the more I understand, the more the gospel of Jesus Christ becomes
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.260]   glorious.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.840]   And there is nothing in this world.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.220]   Even as we talk about the love of moms over the children, every Mother's Day we talk about
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.780]   how mothers love their children, that's the closest thing that we can get to the love
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.780]   of Christ.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:51.820]   But the more I see the love of Christ, the love of moms does not compare.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.060]   It's nothing like it.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.060]   There's nothing like it.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:04.180]   And the more I dig, the more I see, the distance becomes further and further.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:21.340]   And the more I understand this, the more the world becomes foolish, so trivial, so stupid,
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:32.620]   so easily distracted, so easily consumed, so easily tempted, all because we've taken
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:37.360]   our eyes off of Christ.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:49.700]   To have the greatest gift, to have the greatest gift, to taste His goodness, to have confessed,
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:59.060]   to have opened the eyes to see His glory, and then to be amused with this world, there's
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:03.140]   nothing more foolish.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:10.360]   And that's why the Bible talks about dogs returning to vomit, as grotesque as that is,
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:15.760]   in comparison to God's glory, and the best and the most beautiful thing that can be offered
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.260]   in this world.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:25.020]   In comparison, vomit seems like an understatement.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:30.140]   That's why He concludes everything by saying, "May the God of hope fill you with joy and
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:36.780]   peace, and believing that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope."
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:44.260]   See this hope, because of His mercy, leads to joy and peace.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.980]   How can He command us to be rejoicing?
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.140]   In 1 Thessalonians 5, 16, rejoice always.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.180]   Philippians 4, 4, "Rejoice in the Lord always."
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.740]   Again, I will say rejoice.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:58.260]   Because the word rejoice is used as an equivalent to live.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.980]   He's not saying exist.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.460]   I died for you so that you can exist.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.020]   He said I died for you so that you can live.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.060]   Zoe.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.740]   So the word rejoice is just another word for live.
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.240]   For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:21.740]   in Him shall not perish but have everlasting rejoicing.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:30.020]   He wants us to live the great because rejoicing is at the core of worshiping.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:34.580]   Rejoicing and peace is the foundation in which we stand to worship.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:38.940]   So you cannot worship God when you're not rejoicing.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:47.140]   So when He says do not grumble, it's just another way of saying worship.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:57.740]   God came to restore worship, to give hope, to give life, to give peace.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:06.460]   The greatest witness to the world is not your ability to articulate the gospel, is not your
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:13.780]   generosity with money, is not the organization, is not koinonia, is not fellowship, is not
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:20.860]   community, because what the world lacks more than anything else is to be in the presence
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.700]   of God.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:31.000]   So the greatest witness that you and I can give to the world is worship.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:40.660]   When non-Christians see a group of people where worship, hope, joy, and peace is restored,
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:45.620]   they immediately recognize that they don't have this.
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:49.780]   And that's what they are attracted to.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:56.940]   So above everything else that you and I strive for, more than anything else, is there an
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:01.460]   affection for Christ at this root of your worship?
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:06.300]   And I'm not talking about some charismatic experience, I'm not talking about some gnostic
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.740]   knowledge that only a few people have.
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.000]   What are you pursuing?
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.520]   Every Christian is a genuine Christian because he confesses that his eyes were opened to
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.460]   his glory.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.100]   Is that something that you just confessed in the past?
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.460]   Or is that something that drives you to worship?
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.980]   Is that just some doctrinal statement that you sign?
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:39.140]   Or is that what's compelling you to read your word, to pray, to be merciful?
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:44.380]   Let me conclude with the reading of this text in Isaiah 40, 26-31.
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.940]   Lift up your eyes on high and see.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.740]   Who created these?
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:53.260]   He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name, by the greatness of his
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:58.580]   might and because he is strong in power, not one is missing.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:04.340]   Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, my way is hidden from the Lord and my right
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.060]   is disregarded by my God?
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.820]   In other words, that he doesn't care.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.820]   Have you not known?
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:11.820]   Have you not heard?
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:17.340]   The Lord is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.020]   He does not faint or grow weary.
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:20.900]   His understanding is unsearchable.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:27.280]   He gives power to the faint and to him who has no might, he increases strength.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:33.100]   Even youth shall faint and be weary and young men shall fall exhausted.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:37.280]   But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.340]   They shall mount up with wings like eagles.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.080]   They shall run and not be weary.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:45.020]   They shall walk and not faint.
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.020]   Will you pray with me?
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:51.460]   I want to lead us in prayer and then our worship team will take over.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.300]   But would you close your eyes in prayer with me?
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.780]   Then after I pray, again, I encourage you guys to take some time to pray for yourselves.
