[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews, chapter 1.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.620]   We're looking at verse 10 through 14.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.960]   And the Lord in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.140]   of your hands.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.800]   They will perish, but you remain, and they all will become old like garment.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.440]   And like a mantle you will roll them up, like a garment they will also be changed.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.900]   But you are the same, and your years will not come to an end.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.000]   But to which of the angels has he ever said, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.040]   a footstool for your feet"?
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.080]   Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to render service for the sake of those
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.080]   who inherit salvation?
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.520]   I've already prayed, so I'm just going to jump in.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.680]   The text that we're looking at, obviously, is an ongoing message of putting Christ first.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.320]   And as I've mentioned earlier in the previous sermons, that the goal of the study of the
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.960]   book of Hebrews is not simply for us to get Christology correct.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.640]   So if somebody asks you, or if you have a debate with a Jehovah Witness about the identity
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.920]   of Jesus, that you have a go-to text to go to and exposit and say, "This is what the
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   Bible says."
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.760]   That is not our ultimate goal.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.740]   Because you can get all the answers right.
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.320]   You can be the best expositor of Scripture and completely miss the point.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.720]   Because the greatest commandment in Scripture is not to know theologically who Jesus is.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.960]   The greatest commandment in Scripture is to love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.660]   soul, mind, and strength.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.320]   And the reason why the glory of Christ is being magnified in the book of Hebrews is
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.320]   to get us to that end, so that we would not drift and put our hopes and confidence in
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.120]   anything else but Christ.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.280]   So for eleven chapters, Harry predicted it's going to be taking me three years, right?
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.240]   So for eleven chapters, for three years, we're going to be exalting Christ.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.480]   And our goal is the same goal as the author book of Hebrews.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.720]   Is that the more and more we see who Jesus is, that less and less, that whatever it is
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.840]   that we are tempted by to drift toward, will become rubbish in light of this surpassing
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.040]   knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.400]   It's always challenging to see young couples and young families move.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.160]   Every single one of us who have children who are worried and concerned every single day
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.680]   that we're not providing what is best for our children, and to have a young family say,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   "You know what?
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.000]   Jesus is better.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.040]   Jesus is better.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.800]   And I trust him more than I trust myself.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.620]   I trust him more than our bank account," is a visual testimony of what he's really trying
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.680]   to do, to not to drift.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.880]   Again, because we, many of us, have been to church for so long that when that question
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   is asked, "Do you love Jesus?"
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   It's like, "Yeah, of course I do."
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.240]   "Do you believe in the inerrancy of Scripture?"
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.240]   "Yeah, of course."
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.800]   "Do you believe in the Trinity?"
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   "Of course."
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.540]   It's a knee-jerk reaction without really serious thought, until you get challenged.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.200]   So if you ask somebody who's outside the church, "Do you love Jesus?"
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.840]   They'll think about it.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.000]   They don't go to church.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.200]   They don't do this and that.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.680]   So I wasn't baptized, so they'll say, "No, I don't, because I don't do these things."
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.200]   But how do people who are in the church, who are engrossed in church activity, who go to
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.560]   small groups, maybe even leading, who are so engrossed in religious activity in the
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   church?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.440]   And again, when I say religious, it doesn't automatically mean something negative.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.600]   It's just we're engaged in these activities.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.560]   How do we examine ourselves?
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.400]   How do we answer that question, that it's not just a knee-jerk reaction that, "I'm
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   serving the church.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   I'm sacrificing.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   I'm giving.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.360]   And I'm doing this, and I'm doing that, and I'm paying my offering, and so therefore,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.320]   of course I do."
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:03.400]   But you know, when that question is asked, that Christ looks beyond all of that.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.500]   That He can see all throughout our superficial activities that we're engaged in and know
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.540]   exactly where we are with the Lord.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.040]   And so you could easily drift as a Sunday school teacher, as a worship leader, as an
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.560]   elder in the church, and even as the pastor who preaches every single Sunday.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.000]   I can do this.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.360]   I can exposit, and I've been doing it long enough where I can say what I need to say
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.680]   while my heart is completely drifting away from God.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.880]   So if I can do it, I know you can.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.960]   So the question is, where do you stand with Christ?
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.560]   I'm not asking you what you are doing.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.140]   I'm not asking you what theology or how much of the scripture have you read this week.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.140]   I'm asking you, who do you say Jesus is?
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.360]   What is your confession outside of the church, outside of the small group?
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.580]   Will your co-workers know what Jesus means to you?
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.140]   Do your family members know what Jesus means to you?
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.840]   Do the people who know you, around you, and watches your life, and watches who you are,
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.980]   do they know what Jesus means to you?
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.380]   Or is it only just your small group people, or just the church people?
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.620]   Have we drifted?
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.340]   Have we made the focus about something lesser than Christ?
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.900]   And that's exactly what He's been dealing with, and He begins at the top of the list,
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.060]   the angels.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.980]   And Jesus is greater than the angels, and we went through four of them, so today is
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.720]   the fifth one.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.560]   We're looking at verse 10.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.180]   Jesus is greater than the angels because Jesus is the eternal creator.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.900]   Verse 10, "And you Lord, in the beginning, lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.500]   are the works of your hand."
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.100]   This is a direct quote from Psalm 102, verse 24 through 27.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.540]   What's interesting about that verse, it is clear that it's in reference to God the Father.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.620]   And yet, the psalmist is using that, saying that this is in reference to Jesus.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.460]   Some people may look at Jesus' identity, and they say, "Well, you know, when Jesus started
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.580]   saying, 'Before Abraham was I am,' I mean, no wonder people got confused, because there's
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.860]   no evidence of Jesus in the Old Testament."
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.220]   So when we look to the New Testament, it's obvious.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.740]   I mean, it's understandable that the Pharisees, when Jesus began to say, "I am God," that
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.500]   they would have rejected him.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.060]   If you examine the Scriptures carefully, you'll find that God had left such strong imprint
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.500]   of who Jesus is, that there's no way that they could have missed it.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.860]   In Isaiah 9, verse 6, when Jesus appears, a messianic prophecy is declared, and it says
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.660]   this, "For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us, and a government will
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:03.340]   rest on his shoulders, and the name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.440]   Father, Prince of Peace."
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.060]   How can you possibly read that and say, "Jesus is a lesser God," or "a God"?
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.900]   He says, "No, Jesus himself is God."
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.900]   In every way, it was made very clear that the Son of God who is coming is God himself.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.500]   He is the creator.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:29.780]   In verse 11 and 12, he says, "And they will all become old like garment, and like a mantle
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.180]   you will roll them up, like a garment they will also be changed, but you are the same,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.340]   and your years will not come to an end."
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.340]   Again, I want you to understand the point of what he's saying, because we can look at
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.020]   that and say, "Well, Jesus is eternal, Jesus is the creator, he's the God."
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.180]   But why does he say that?
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:54.340]   Why is correct Christology important and practical in our life, and not just knowledge?
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:00.260]   Because the reason why he quotes this passage is not to simply say, "God, Jesus is so great."
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.300]   He's saying everything else that you know will change.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:10.860]   And he uses one of the most fundamental things that people can relate to, is their garment.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.620]   You have to understand that at that particular time in history, the majority of the people
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.380]   did not own more than one garment.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.740]   So when Jesus said, "If they ask you for your inner clothing, give them your outer
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:27.760]   clothing," basically he's saying, he's basically exaggerating, hyperbole, "Give them everything."
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.340]   So it's not like asking somebody who has a wardrobe of clothes and say, "Hey, let me
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.620]   have a shirt," and say, "No, give him a shirt."
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.420]   You have to understand what it meant to them was, if they want that, just give it to them,
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.420]   right?
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.140]   Give it to them freely.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.700]   He's talking about somebody who would be naked if he gave.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.180]   He's using this fundamental thing that they had for survival.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:57.920]   He says, "Like garments, no matter how pretty, no matter how nice," he says, "Eventually,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.440]   it will grow old."
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:06.420]   And then secondly, he says, "If you happen to be wealthy and you have more than one garment
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.980]   than you have many in your closet," he said, "Eventually, they will change.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.840]   The style will change.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.540]   You might lose some weight.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.180]   You might gain some weight."
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:25.660]   Maybe being tight was in one year, and then being loose is in the next year.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.660]   And you look at fashion, it's just so crazy because people make holes in their pants and
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.480]   it becomes more expensive.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.080]   So you were, you know, that same pants would have been trash one year, you know, you add
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.240]   another, you add a couple of holes and then it becomes more expensive.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:46.520]   So he's using something fundamental and he's saying, "Like a garment, it can just change."
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.760]   Like every single one of us.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.000]   How many of you were walking out of your house and you looked at the shirt that you wore
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.560]   and you just didn't like it and then you changed it?
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.280]   You just changed it.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.680]   You didn't sit there and think about theology.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.320]   You didn't think about like how difficult.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   You just changed it.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.320]   It's just that simple.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320]   Right?
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.080]   The weather changes, your clothes changes.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.540]   Your age changes, your clothes changes.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.480]   Your weight changes, your clothes changes.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.120]   Style changes, your clothes changes.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   Right?
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.400]   And so he's using these fundamental things that people had and he's using that as an
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:24.360]   illustration that everything that we know, eventually, they drift and they change.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.720]   I mean, that's just science.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.520]   That's not deep theology.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.360]   You don't need to be a Christian for 15, 20 years to understand that.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.000]   Everything you know, eventually, will fade.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.840]   You know, a brand new car six, seven years ago that you loved and adored, took care of
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.640]   and waxed, got dents all over it.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.680]   Now it's used.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.200]   It's not worth as much.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.000]   A brand new house that you moved into that you're so proud of, eventually, it'll creak.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.720]   It'll have plumbing issues.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.920]   You have critters walking in and it's no longer new.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.760]   So that's what he's saying, like everything you know that has been created, no matter
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   how fundamentally you need it, eventually, it fades.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.120]   And obviously, this isn't just goal about clothing.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:20.400]   It's food, human relationships, government, what we value was so important 20 years ago.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.800]   It's no longer important today.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   It was trivial 50 years ago, has taken center stage.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   That's why you hear politicians and they're making promises 25 years ago and they completely
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.160]   contradict themselves now.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.120]   That's not a Republican-Democratic problem.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.800]   That's a human problem.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.640]   Because at that time, that was the issue.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.640]   That was important.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   That was going to get them elected.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.400]   But if you say that now, you can never get elected because times have changed.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.280]   Everything that we pursue in this world, eventually, will change.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:57.480]   So the purpose behind why he mentions Jesus Christ as the creator, he's saying all of
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.760]   it will change.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:06.900]   And the only steady thing throughout history and throughout eternity is Christ.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.880]   In 2 Peter 3, 10-11, it says, "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in which
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.000]   the heavens will pass away, with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.960]   heat and the earth and its works will be burned up."
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.360]   Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people are you to
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.240]   be in holy conduct and godliness?
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240]   That's the point.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:37.000]   Since everything else is going to be destroyed and Christ is the only remaining consistency,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.180]   how should we live?
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.640]   What is it that we value?
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.760]   What is it that we're pursuing?
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.320]   Are we pursuing empty things?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:53.160]   Are we valuing something above Christ that you know 100% is going to perish?
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.440]   Not it might perish, not you might not.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.060]   Every single person, you don't have to be a Christian to acknowledge that.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.720]   Every single human being acknowledges everything will fade.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.840]   And that's what it says, 1 Peter 1, 24-25, "For all flesh is like grass and all of its
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.240]   glory like the flower of the grass.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.480]   The grass withers and the flowers fall off, but the word of the Lord endures forever."
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.680]   And this is the word which was preached to you.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:28.080]   Isn't the heartache and the pain in this world is loving something that can't love you back?
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.780]   Loving something that you cannot hold on to, that's great pain.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:42.520]   Whether it's friendship, whether it's a girl, guy, your own children, a job, security, that
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.040]   you love it so much, but they don't love you back.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.400]   It doesn't have to be a person, it can be material things.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.080]   He said all of it will fade away.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.440]   Only the word of the Lord.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.360]   That's why it says in Hebrews 13, 8, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.080]   Yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.880]   You know, this Psalm, Psalm 102, we don't know exactly who wrote it.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:18.320]   But when you read Psalm 102, it's clear that something horrible was happening in Jerusalem.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.080]   This is a man who's watching the destruction of Jerusalem and he's grieving for God.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.280]   So if you look at Psalm 102, it is divided into two parts.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.800]   The first part is grieving.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.480]   Where are you God?
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.600]   Why are the enemies coming in and destroying?
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.920]   Why are the people being...
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.120]   So everything that he knew is dying and being destroyed.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:42.400]   So many commentators and scholars believe that it could have been one of the kings or
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   one of the prophets and they saw the Assyrians coming and attacking Jerusalem and they were
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   falling.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.760]   It could have been the Assyrians, it could have been the Babylonians or the Persians,
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.600]   any one of the superpowers who came in and they're watching the destruction of Jerusalem.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   And they've been waiting for decades, for centuries, that God would restore Israel because
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.160]   God made a covenant with them.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.240]   I'm going to bless you, I'm going to multiply your descendants and the whole world is going
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.120]   to be blessed through you.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.640]   But that's not what they're seeing.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.880]   They're seeing the destruction of their cities and their capable men and women being dragged
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.480]   away to foreign land.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.780]   And as they are watching this, they are grieving.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.080]   But the second part of that, it says, but you oh Lord, even though everything is dying,
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:34.140]   everything is being dragged away, but you oh Lord are the same.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:41.400]   The garments fade, they will be changed, they will be rolled away, but you oh Lord are the
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.840]   same.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.300]   The purpose of this, again, is not to simply say, look at Jesus, how eternal he is.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.220]   But what does that mean to you in your life?
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.680]   If everything fades and only Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever, and all
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.840]   the glory that we covet is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.940]   What does that mean to you?
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.180]   How does that affect you practically?
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.920]   How does that affect what causes you joy?
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.160]   How does that affect your values and the things that you hope for?
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.920]   What causes you to be sad?
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.820]   Where you live, how you spend your money, how you raise your kids, what you desire of
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:29.480]   a church, how does that affect every practical aspect of your life?
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.300]   I can give you an example of that, the man who wrote the song, "It is Well with My Soul."
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.820]   I know many of you know the background story behind that, but a man named Horatio Saper
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.900]   is a very successful businessman in the late 1900s.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.620]   In fact, we would say he wasn't just an average successful man, he would be what we would
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.340]   be considered a multi-billionaire.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:57.460]   He had buildings upon buildings in Chicago, and at the peak of his success, their fire
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.820]   breaks out and destroys most of his property.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.900]   And you have to understand, at that time, you know, there wasn't a good insurance, and
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.340]   so if it burned, it burned.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.540]   And so his, a good chunk of his wealth is burned up, and he's just recuperating from
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.540]   that.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   But soon after, he decides to send his four children and his wife overseas to take a vacation
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.620]   out in Europe.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:29.340]   And then he gets a mail from his wife saying they had an accident and they lost three of
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:36.020]   their children, four of their children, and only their wife remained.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.900]   And so his life, his biography looks exactly like Job's life.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.620]   He was a man of great success, he was a man who loved God, but as a result of that, you
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.100]   know, whatever the reason, he lost everything.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.100]   When he's on his way to see his wife on the boat, he wrote this, the lyrics.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.060]   He didn't write the music to it, but he wrote the lyrics to it.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.300]   It is well with my soul.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.100]   Now if you don't understand the context of this, it's still a great song.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.300]   You know, it is well with my soul.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.540]   But when you understand the context in which this man wrote it, only a Christian who knows
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.980]   the Lord would understand what he is saying.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.140]   How can it be well with your soul, you lost everything?
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.180]   How can it possibly be well with your soul?
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:28.020]   You lost all your children and you're on your way to go comfort your wife.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.300]   How can these words be coming out of your mouth?
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:39.180]   When peace like a river attendeth my soul, when sorrows like sea billows roll.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.060]   You can imagine the pain that he was in when he wrote that.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:51.860]   For my lot, thou hast taught me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.420]   Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, lest the blessed assurance control
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:02.540]   that Christ has regarded my helpless estate and has shed his own blood for my soul.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.260]   It is well with my soul.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.300]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:13.420]   And the reason why he has this hope and joy in Christ in the midst of tremendous suffering,
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:19.460]   he said, my sin, oh the bliss of the glorious thought, my sin, not in part but the whole,
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.340]   is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:28.620]   Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.820]   These words sound like a crazy man.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:37.700]   If you do not understand the God behind these words.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.900]   Talk to a man who has experienced what he has experienced and say, it is well with my
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.420]   soul.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:48.180]   Those sorrows like sea billows roll.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.860]   It is crazy words.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:56.740]   Unless you know the Jesus that the author of Hebrews is talking about.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:04.020]   Unless you believe that Jesus is greater than whatever success that you've had.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:10.620]   That Jesus is greater than your wife, your husband, your children, and safety, and hope,
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.500]   and a bank account, whatever that may be.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.020]   Unless you know this same Jesus as this man.
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:25.980]   See, Psalm 102 was written in the context of great tragedy, but it is quoted here as
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:33.660]   a reminder to us that though everything fades, even the heavens, though they fade, Jesus
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.860]   is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:45.340]   That is the encouragement that, again, we encourage the tongues with.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:50.260]   I was thinking about it even just yesterday, just thinking like, that is a strong move.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.220]   That is a tough move for this family.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.220]   Two young children.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.300]   Had a great job, great paying job, and they are moving.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.700]   The greatest fear is not the fear of China.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.260]   I think Harry can handle that.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.140]   Harry is a man.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.140]   He can handle it.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.780]   He is a soldier.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:16.780]   The tough part of it is leaving what you know.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.100]   But Jesus Christ is the same.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.620]   We may not see them physically, and we will see them.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.900]   We will visit, and they will come visit us.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.780]   But Jesus is the same.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:34.060]   In fact, when you live in life in obedience, Jesus is much greater.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.740]   It is like going to look at a waterfall from a distance.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.740]   It is beautiful.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.580]   It is a completely different experience when you are right there.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.660]   See, that is the point that he is trying to get at.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.580]   It is not just, get the Christology right.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.500]   If you see the glory of Christ, what does that mean?
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   How does that affect your life?
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.700]   How does it affect where you live?
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.140]   How does it affect how you spend your money?
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.700]   Sixth and finally, he says, "Jesus is greater than the angels because Jesus sits at God's
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.700]   right hand."
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.100]   Again, this is a direct quote of Psalm 110.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.940]   In fact, this is such a prominent Bible verse, Messianic verse, it is quoted 25 separate
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.740]   times in the New Testament.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.300]   Because it is clear.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:19.140]   It is a prophecy about a great, great, great, great grandchild that is coming from the David's
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.980]   line and how his throne is going to be established.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.380]   So the Jews clung to this text, waiting for the Messiah to come.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:32.700]   "The Lord says to my Lord," and this is David speaking, "Sit at my right hand until I make
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.300]   your enemies a footstool for your feet."
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.180]   Again, this is a direct quote from this passage.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.540]   "The Lord will stretch forth your strong scepter from Zion saying, 'Rule in the midst of your
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.540]   enemies.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.820]   Your people will volunteer freely in the day of your power.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:48.060]   In holy array from the womb of the dawn, your youth are to you as the dew.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.560]   The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.140]   You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.740]   So again, the Jews memorized this text.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.460]   Kind of like we memorized John 3.16.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.420]   For God so loved the world that...
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.700]   Right.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.380]   So most of you can just recite that.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.540]   Whether you memorize it or not, because it's such an important part of the text.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.960]   You go to a football stadium, you'll see John 3.16.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.860]   If you grew up in a church, you probably memorized that in Sunday school at VBS or Oana.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.240]   This is one of the texts that the Jews had the kids memorize and recite.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.100]   Because it was the promise of the Messiah that was going to come.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:32.140]   But the way they applied it was, "He's going to come as a mighty king who's going to rule
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.140]   over everybody.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:37.020]   He's going to dominate the Romans and we're going to be the superpower."
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.140]   But then when the Messiah came, they didn't recognize him.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:46.100]   Because Jesus began to say some stuff that didn't make a lot of sense to them.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.620]   Jesus quotes this passage in speaking to the Pharisees, Matthew 22, 41 through 46.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.980]   Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question.
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.740]   What do you think about the Christ?
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.620]   Whose son is he?
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.940]   They said to him, "The son of David."
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.660]   He said to them, "Then how does David in the spirit call him Lord?"
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:08.220]   Saying, "The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.780]   your feet.'"
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.500]   If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.900]   He's taking this text that everybody knew and recited and Jesus said, "Let's go back
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:17.900]   to that text.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.900]   Let's go through John 3, 16.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.480]   Let's see if you really understood.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:29.520]   If David is speaking of the Lord and he calls the Messiah the Lord and it's his grandkid
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:36.780]   and if he's just another man, why is he calling his great-great-grandkid my Lord?
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.140]   So who is this Messiah?
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:44.180]   He's using this text that was clearly implanted in the Old Testament that they recited, that
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:51.940]   everybody knew and he said, "He's not just a man."
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:25:00.340]   And the point of all of that is that Christ came to conquer and he says God's going to
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.380]   exalt him until all of his enemies are put under his feet and that is explained to us
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.980]   in 1 Corinthians 15, 25, 26, "For he, Jesus, must reign until he has put all his enemies
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:18.220]   under his feet and the last enemy that will be abolished is death."
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.220]   The Jews at that time thought that the Romans were their enemies.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.420]   Prior to that they thought it was the Persians.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.580]   Prior to that they thought it was the Babylonians.
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.540]   Prior to that they thought it was the Assyrians.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.700]   Prior to that they thought it was the Canaanites.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.300]   In different periods of time, they had different things that they needed to conquer, but Jesus
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:43.620]   Christ came to conquer the universal enemy of all mankind, which is sin, which ultimately
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.060]   causes death.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:51.820]   And he says, "He will reign until death is done away with and the gospel is spread to
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:58.140]   the remotest part of the world and when they have heard the message of the cross," he says,
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.980]   "then he will come."
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:08.500]   And that's what that reference was referring to, the age of the church to spread the gospel,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   to go.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.140]   Now, to go doesn't necessarily mean that every single one of us pack our bags and move out
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:20.140]   to China or India, but what it does mean is to stop living for ourselves, for something
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.740]   that's temporary, that's going to perish, that's going to be ruined, it's going to be
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.080]   changed.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.580]   How many of you who have best friends in high school are the same best friends today?
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.940]   A few of you, many of you not.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:40.380]   How many of you who had a group of friends six, seven years ago are the same group of
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.580]   friends that you hang out with today?
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.180]   A few of you, many of you not.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.940]   Everything changes.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:54.340]   The weather changes, political climate changes, what we value change, politicians will change.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.580]   Right now it's the Republicans, next time it might be the Democrats.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.020]   We don't know what the government is going to look like.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:09.380]   Whatever it is that we put our hope in, eventually it will perish.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.920]   But Christ, he's here to reign.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:18.040]   And you and I, as the body of Christ, is to carry out his mission.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.700]   So our primary goal, the primary mission in life, until he comes, and so when we are glorified
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:33.140]   with him, this glory that we are seeking in this God forsaken world, it is just so foolish
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:39.660]   when you take a step back and look at the things that causes us grief.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:46.380]   You think about it, when you're in your twenties, you look back at your teens, while puberty
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.580]   was going on, and your world was a mess.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:28:00.580]   Why that boy's attention was so important to you, and why that girl's one careless word
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.220]   destroyed you, and you look back at it now, look at your hairstyle, the shoes that you
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:11.420]   wore, and you say, "Oh my gosh, thank God God delivered me from my teens."
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.600]   You woke up.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.540]   You say that in your twenties, and I know you college students want to erase everything
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.100]   on your Facebook from three years ago.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:27.820]   You get to your thirties, and you look back in your college life, foolish children.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:33.100]   I remember when I was in my twenties, the foolish things that I desired, and the list
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:37.320]   of things that I wanted in a husband and a wife, and you look back at it now, and they
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:47.140]   all look foolish to you, and when you see the younger college students, they're children.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.900]   And then those of you who are in your forties, look back in your thirties, and the things
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.380]   that you value in your thirties, it was so important to you in your thirties.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.260]   So committed, "I'm going to do this with my kids, I'm going to do this with my kids."
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.980]   Then you look back in your forties, and you look back and say, "Man, all of that stuff,
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:03.980]   foolish thirty-year-olds.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.680]   You don't know life yet.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.380]   Just wait, give it another decade, and you open your eyes and see what happens."
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.820]   I just crawled into my fifties, so I'm not there yet.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:24.700]   But forties sounds so foolish.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.540]   I'm not in my sixties yet, so I'm sure the sixty-year-olds are looking at me, it's like,
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.180]   "Fifty, come on."
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.140]   It's our whole life.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.700]   We wake up in the next generation, and everything that we pursue that was so important to us,
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.940]   that we were willing to sacrifice everything for, just looks so foolish to us.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:51.500]   But ten years later, God is speaking to us from eternity, and He's watching all of it
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:56.300]   from generation to generation, and He places in His scripture, "There is nothing new under
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.140]   the sun.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.780]   Everything is vanity.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.300]   Everything that we pursue is vanity under the sun."
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.660]   That's the point that He's trying to get to.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:14.980]   These angels, these things that you're tempted to drift back to, the safety, the comfort,
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:20.000]   the glory of men, all of that will soon perish.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.940]   But Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.980]   And then finally, He says in verse 13, "But to which of the angels have you said, 'Sit
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.460]   at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.180]   Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to render service for the sake of those
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.420]   who will inherit salvation?"
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:40.260]   In other words, angels are just a gift to you.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:47.060]   And that is our tendency for all of us, to take the gift and celebrate the gift rather
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.660]   than the giver.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:55.780]   We get, God gives us money, you know, we thank God for the money, and the next thing we do,
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.460]   we idolize the money.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.460]   We love the money.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.380]   And we soon forget about the giver.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.980]   God gives us a family.
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.780]   We thank you for the family.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.780]   And soon we take our eyes off of God and we idolize our family.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.460]   And we take the gift that God has given us, that was given us to serve us, and then we
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.340]   begin serving it.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.040]   That's what legalism looks like.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.460]   God gave us righteousness, and then He said to live up to it.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.020]   Live up to what has been given to you.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.140]   And then we take this walk with God, and we make that our pursuit, we make that our badge
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.980]   of honor, and it becomes a burden.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.660]   Instead of righteousness serving us, we are serving righteousness, and then it's become
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.340]   burden.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:46.220]   That's exactly what the Pharisees did with the Sabbath.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:52.380]   God gave them the Sabbath so that they can rest, and the word in itself means rest.
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:32:02.060]   Because nobody worked as hard than the Pharisees to make sure that they got the Sabbath right.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.780]   And so that's the thing that they couldn't see with Jesus.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.780]   They said, "Well Jesus, why is He doing this?
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.780]   Why is He feeding people?
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.780]   What is He doing?"
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.780]   And remember what Jesus said?
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.300]   "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath."
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:17.780]   And He says, "Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:26.620]   It was given to you to serve you, not to burden you, not to make it difficult."
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:32.020]   He says, "The angels were given to you, given to serve me to serve you."
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.780]   And you're taking a gift that has been given to you, and you're turning it around, and
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.300]   you're idolizing it.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.660]   That's a tendency for every single one of us.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:47.940]   The very gift that God has given us, when we forget the giver, we end up starting to
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.740]   worship it and idolize it.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.540]   That's the point that He's trying to get to.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.940]   They're here for us.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.740]   Live up to the calling that we've been given.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:07.140]   Jesus says in John 14, 6, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.100]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.460]   So our goal through the study of the book of Hebrews, whether it takes three years or
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.060]   five years, I don't know yet, right?
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.940]   The goal of the book of Hebrews, the study of the book of Hebrews is to exalt the name
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:31.700]   of Christ so as we gaze upon His glory, that everything else would truly become rubbish.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:38.500]   So that we can confess with all conviction, with all genuineness, with all truth, that
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:44.100]   I love Jesus with all my heart, soul, and strength.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:50.180]   The goal for the reason why we are going to spend the next few years in this book.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.660]   Let's take some time to pray as we ask our worship team to come up.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.820]   And as we pray, again, I want to ask you guys to focus your prayer specifically on the Tong
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.820]   family.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:08.500]   And again, as they go, we want to just wave goodbye from a distance.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.060]   Those of you who do know them, do your best to keep in touch with them.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.860]   Let them know that we're praying for them.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.540]   And those of you who don't know, get to know them.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:21.020]   Even if they're there, say, "Hey, you know, we haven't met, but I'm encouraged and challenged
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.020]   and we want to keep you in prayer."
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.020]   And just email them, right?
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.820]   Just don't say foolish things on there, because it's getting screened, right?
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.560]   But just let them know.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.860]   And take some time to really pray for them so that at least in our hearts, in our prayers,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.180]   that it will go with them and engage.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.420]   And so all the things that they go through, that we're not just going to watch them like
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.180]   we're just reading some newspaper, right?
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.060]   That we would be able to participate in it.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:49.260]   So let's take some time to pray for ourselves and take some time to pray for the Tongs as
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.260]   they go.
