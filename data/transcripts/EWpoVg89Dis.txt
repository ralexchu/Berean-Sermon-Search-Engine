[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   if you're already registered, go ahead and make your way over.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.440]   We're going to give people just some extra time
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.440]   to get situated, and then we will start

[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.440]   in just a couple more moments.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   But again, for those of you guys who can hear me on the outside,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   please make your way in. Thank you so much.

[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.440]   Let's pray over that topic together.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.440]   Lord, we know that when you envision and picture your people,
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.440]   you see people who are longing for you with everything that they have,
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.440]   with all of their might, with all their mind and their soul.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.440]   And I pray, Father God, that we as a church would be a people
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.440]   who is not embarrassed of you, but rather with full vulnerability,
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.440]   seeking you with every ounce of energy we have.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   I pray, Father God, that if any of us are just weary,
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.440]   perhaps we lack confidence because we failed too many times,
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   help us just to recognize that none of that matters
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   because you deserve our worship in any moment.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.440]   Whether we feel strong or we feel weak, we recognize, Lord God,
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.440]   that does not matter, because, Lord, to us,
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   it is always a blessing to be in your presence.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.440]   For, God, being in your presence is restoration,
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.440]   it's strength, it's everything.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.440]   And so I pray, Father God, no matter what state we're in,
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   no matter what baggage we come to this place,
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   I pray, Lord, that we would seek you.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   We would seek you in truth and in spirit.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.440]   And, Lord, I pray, Father Lord, that as we do that,
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   we would recognize to us the sweetest joys is with you.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.440]   So, Lord, even as we sing these songs and we lift up these prayers,
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:24.440]   I pray that it would be the desire of our heart to meet you intimately.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:29.440]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.440]   As we continue with worship through song, you may remain seated.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   And just as we have prayed about seeking and desiring the Lord together,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.440]   let us sing the song, "As the deer panteth for the water,
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   so my soul longeth after thee."

[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:41.440]   So at this time we are going to transition into a different format of prayer.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:50.440]   I'm going to ask Pastor Nate to come up and he's going to represent us in a topic, just praying for our ready hearts.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:50:00.440]   Because of the nature of the topic of the retreat, we're going to be given a lot of exhortation and even practical exhortation of what to do about our relationships.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:06.440]   So we want to be praying over, let's see, Pastor Nate are you here?
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   There you are, okay.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.440]   Please come on up.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:16.440]   He's going to be leading us in praying over, just making sure that our hearts are ready to obey and follow those exhortations.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:21.440]   So as he prays, please just follow along in your hearts when we pray together.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   Let's pray.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.440]   Heavenly Father, we do want to be obedient.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:33.440]   And Lord, we so often take your words and we treat them as rules.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:39.440]   Things that we're just supposed to follow along, but God we sing a song to you right now.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.440]   God, you are our heart's desire.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.440]   Father, what you love is what we love.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.440]   What you want is what we want.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:53.440]   Would you cause in us, Lord, a great obedience that comes because of our great love for you.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:51:00.440]   Father, we take a moment tonight to look out at all the things that we've been following.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   All the things that we've been obeying.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:08.440]   And God, we take this night to declare our obedience to you alone.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.440]   God, you're our God.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   You're our Lord.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.440]   You're our master.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.440]   You are our everything.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.440]   Father, there is no other God in our lives but you.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.440]   God, we hate the idols that we've set up.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   We hate God, the filth that is around.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   And Lord, we look to you and we remember.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.440]   God, that you look upon us.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.440]   And God, you alone have given us life.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.440]   You've given us hope.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.440]   And so, God, we obey you because we want to.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.440]   God, we want to give you our lives.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.440]   Help us.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   Because we can't do this apart from your help.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   Spirit, we ask you to come inside and work your work.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.440]   Transform us.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.440]   Discipline us.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.440]   Change us.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.440]   Make us more like the Jesus we love.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.440]   Father, please help us.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   We want this so badly in our lives.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:18.440]   And God, we are so prone to wander.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.440]   We're so prone, God, to take our eyes off of you.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   And so, Lord, let this happen not as we force humility upon
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   ourselves, that we want to just cut ourselves down and force
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.440]   ourselves to obey.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.440]   But, God, that we would truly see you as you are.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.440]   God, we would remember that all creation bows down before you.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.440]   All creation, God, adores you, listens to you.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   You speak and everything listens.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.440]   It is only the human God that might disobey.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.440]   And, Lord, we no longer want to be like that.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   We are changed people.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   We are kingdom people.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.440]   And so, Father, we want to fall in line.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   We want to hear your word and love it.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.440]   We want it to be sweet to our ears.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.440]   And we want God to be something that we leave declaring with joy
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.440]   and praise and gratitude.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.440]   Lord, we're going to hear some hard stuff this retreat.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   And so, God, when we hear from your word and it tells us to
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   reconcile, that you have given to us the ministry of
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   reconciliation, I pray, that we would go and obey.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.440]   Father, would this place be a place filled with people who
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.440]   desire truly to live in reconciliation with others,
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.440]   that we might extend the love that you've shown to us to
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.440]   others.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   And so, God, we want you to really be honored and glorified
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.440]   in our lives.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.440]   We want you, God, to be so happy with us.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.440]   And so, Lord, we lay these things down before you.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.440]   Thank you.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   And I invite Elder James to come up.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   He's going to be praying over Dr. Street.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.440]   He's here with his wife, Janie.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   And as you know, again, we're going to be doing a lot of
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   things during the retreat.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.440]   But the focal point is for us to hear the exhortation from the
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.440]   truth.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.440]   So, Elder James, please come and pray for boldness and conviction
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.440]   from the preaching.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   All right, let's pray, guys.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:18.440]   Lord, we thank you, Lord God, for Professor John Street as we
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.440]   delve into this topic of biblical reconciliation.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:26.440]   Father, we know that particularly now, Lord,
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:32.440]   there is so much confusion with this idea of reconciliation.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:38.440]   There is man who is trying to reconcile with man on their own
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:43.440]   without you, which we know it is completely impossible, Lord.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:50.440]   And so, Lord, as children of God who have truth, Father,
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.440]   as we are being molded and shaped by it, Lord,
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:59.440]   as we have our minds and our hearts ready and fertile to
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.440]   receive these messages, help us, Lord God,
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:08.440]   to learn to be attentive but to also apply, Lord,
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.440]   to apply these messages in our lives, to show the world,
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.440]   Father, what true reconciliation looks like,
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:18.440]   and that is only in Jesus Christ.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:24.440]   And so as we adorn the gospel message in our individual lives,
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   help us, Lord God, as a church to stand strong in particularly
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.440]   these dark times, Father.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   So we pray for Professor John Street.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   We pray that you will be with him.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.440]   We pray that you would give him conviction and boldness in his
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.440]   speaking.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:47.440]   We pray that we know that he has an ongoing teaching ministry.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.440]   We pray that you will bless that as well.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.440]   And so as we welcome Professor John Street,
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.440]   help us, Lord God, to receive him as family because that's
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.440]   what he is.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.440]   We pray all these things in the name of your son.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.440]   Amen.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.440]   Amen.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.440]   And as a final topic, Elder Joe, if you would come up.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:08.440]   You know, again, there's a lot of times for us to join in small
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.440]   group.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.440]   As you guys know, even the children,
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.440]   they're having a retreat of their own with lessons and things
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.440]   like that.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.440]   So just desiring God to bless everything and make things
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.440]   fruitful.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   Make sure as Elder Joe prays, let's join our hearts to lift
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.440]   up the entire retreat.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   Let's pray together.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.440]   Father, thank you, Lord, for you said in 2 Peter that you've
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.440]   given us every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   We have the gospel.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.440]   And yet, Lord God, you're so gracious to us.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.440]   You've given us even this time to gather as the body of Christ
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   in this place, Lord God, to retreat away.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   And I thank you, Lord God, that I see so many brothers and
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:55.440]   sisters here who have come out to fellowship,
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:00.440]   to encourage one another, and to learn from your word.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   I pray, Lord God, that it may be such a fruitful few days,
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   Lord God, together.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.440]   That our hearts, Lord God, may be knit together and stitched
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   together, Lord God, as one.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   That our love for one another may continue to grow.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.440]   Lord, we pray for the sessions, Lord God,
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.440]   that our minds may be ready, that our hearts may be ready to
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:25.440]   receive your word and to apply its truth in our lives.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.440]   Lord, it may be somewhat, as many other retreats have gone
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.440]   before, may physically get weary and tired,
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:36.440]   but I pray, Lord God, that our spiritual minds may be engaged.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   Lord God, that we can glean much from your word.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.440]   That the blessings, Lord God, that you continue to pour out to
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   undeserving people like ourselves.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:49.440]   It's just so amazing, Lord God, that you're faithful,
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.440]   even when we are disobedient children.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:57.440]   But I pray, Lord God, that the times with Dr. Shreve may be
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.440]   sweet.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.440]   We pray for the times of small groups together, Lord God,
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.440]   in our discussions, in the practical applications,
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.440]   how we think through just to live our lives according to your
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.440]   purposes and ways.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.440]   Lord, that you strengthen us, that you give us time to
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:19.440]   fruitful discussion, true fellowship in the midst of our
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.440]   brothers and sisters sharing together our lives.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.440]   We pray, Lord God, as well for even just our children,
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   Lord God, as they are meeting together.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.440]   We know, Lord God, that there are many and continuing to grow
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.440]   in our children's ministry.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   And I pray, Lord God, for all those who are assisting and
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   volunteering and teaching, that you give them wisdom,
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.440]   that you give them the strength, Lord God,
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.440]   to pour into this next generation, Lord,
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.440]   that the gospel may be clear, that many of these children may
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.440]   come to Christ early as well.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   But ultimately, Lord God, we're just so thankful again that
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.440]   you've gathered the church as we fellowship,
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:06.440]   as we have this extended time to fellowship and get to know one
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.440]   another.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.440]   I pray, Lord God, that we may maximize it,
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.440]   that the people, Lord God, around us that we may not know,
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.440]   that we may be bold and meet each other, Lord God,
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.440]   as we share in this fellowship together as one body.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.440]   So I pray, Lord God, again, that you really stitch our hearts
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:29.440]   together this next few days, that it may be all for your glory.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.440]   Amen.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.440]   Amen.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:38.440]   So before we conclude the evening by joining our voices
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:41.440]   for one final song, I'm going to invite Pastor Peter to come.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:54.440]   And just an encouragement as we approach the weekend.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.440]   So Jason Choi is not here?
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.440]   Okay.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.440]   Did you have something you needed to say?
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   You're after me.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.440]   Okay.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.440]   All right, so I was asked to give a brief encouragement as we
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.440]   kick off our summer retreat.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.440]   I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do this again.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.440]   Okay.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.440]   So Jason obviously had been working like this is his full
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.440]   time job, you know, and all of the teams,
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.440]   like every little thing that's going on requires a lot of work
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.440]   behind the scenes.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.440]   There's people who have, you know,
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   just getting this site with the children, with snacks,
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   just room assignments, small groups.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   There's a lot of things that are going on.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   And so anybody who's ever served in any capacity at retreat,
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.440]   you know it requires a lot of work.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   But with the size of our retreat,
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.440]   everything is exponentially more difficult.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.440]   So please be patient.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   If you don't know what's going on,
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   you don't know where it's going, how come no one told us this,
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.440]   no one told us that, we ask you to suck it up.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   Okay.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.440]   Because there's a lot of work being done behind the scene.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.440]   But because of the size of the retreat,
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   it may be a little bit more difficult just to get anything done.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   Just to get, you know, we need to get people from here to that room.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.440]   That in and of itself is a -- it requires a lot of work.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440]   So try to be patient as much as possible.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.440]   And thank the people who are serving behind the scene who have come
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   earlier, who's, you know, missing sessions so that they can go help with the
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.440]   children, all of these things that are happening all at once.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.440]   So please be patient and help us to do that.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.440]   And, again, like I said, I'm not kidding.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.440]   I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do an all-church retreat after this
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.440]   just because of the size that we have.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   So let's try to milk this as much as possible so that we can years later look
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   back and say, remember when we had our last summer retreat and how great it
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440]   was?
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.440]   So make sure that we have all our memories, you know, do the best that we can
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.440]   to make the best that we can for this retreat.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.440]   One of the things that I wanted to encourage our church with is, as you guys
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.440]   know, our church has been growing.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.440]   It's been growing for many years, but we're probably growing at a faster rate
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.440]   than we've ever in our church history.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.440]   Just -- I think right before the pandemic, we were hitting somewhere around high
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.440]   500.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.440]   Some weeks we were hitting like low 600.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.440]   Our last Sunday was the largest attendance, physical attendance, outside of the
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.440]   online attendance.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.440]   So we have some people who still haven't joined us yet, but we've had 776, I
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.440]   think, and that's the largest number that we had physically.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.440]   And this is with a lot of the college students who are not here, so we're
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.440]   expecting sometime in September and October that usually is our biggest
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.440]   attendance because of the college students who are coming in town.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.440]   And so we are expecting to go over 800.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.440]   So we've actually added a couple hundred during the pandemic.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.440]   And we don't think that this is going to slow down.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   And so in one sense it's exciting because God is bringing all different kinds of
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.440]   people to church and adding to the community.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.440]   But at the same time, whenever the church grows, especially as it is growing now,
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.440]   there is a sense of anxiousness that comes over the staff and for all of us
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:14.440]   because when the church grows, when there is spiritual activity, there's always a
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.440]   counteractivity.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.440]   Satan is actively working, like the Bible says, like a roaring lion seeking
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.440]   someone to devour.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.440]   And when there is fruit being born, there will always be spiritual attack.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:31.440]   And what I've seen through the years, where the attack typically comes from is
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.440]   from within.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.440]   As much as we are concerned about what's going on in the government and
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.440]   California, and I know people have talked about moving to Texas and maybe we can
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.440]   make heaven on earth somewhere.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:50.440]   But usually when there is attack, it happens within the church.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.440]   And so there's -- and usually the way it happens is through relational problems.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.440]   You have certain things that you've kind of held grudge against people or maybe
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:02.440]   certain people rubbed you the wrong way or maybe certain people said something
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.440]   insensitive to you and then you kind of hold that in and then all of a sudden you
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.440]   get stressed and certain opportunities comes and then the fractures begin to
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.440]   happen.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.440]   And that's typically how Satan has worked and that's what I've seen through the
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.440]   years.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.440]   And so the way that the church gets attacked is through relationships.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.440]   And I'm pretty sure that if you've been in church for a while, you can attest to
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440]   that.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.440]   If you've been into other churches, you know, the greatest memories that you
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.440]   have of churches is also with people, but also the most painful things that we
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.440]   remember are also with people.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.440]   And so this topic that we're covering through this retreat, I think it's coming
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:46.440]   at a very timely time because our church is growing that we can easily just kind of
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:51.440]   find a few people that we're close with and then stiff arm everybody else.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.440]   Especially those of you who have been at church for a while, you can get in the
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.440]   habit because you've made close friends at church already.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:01.440]   And so I have my friends, so all these new people that are coming, that's the
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.440]   responsibility for the leadership.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.440]   Thank God I'm not you.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.440]   And then you can kind of huddle and then you get in the habit of church where you
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:12.440]   have a few people that you've gotten to, like, that's your community, but you
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   don't want anybody else inside your community.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.440]   And you've made a country club within the church.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   And so we need to make sure that we avoid that trap, that whether we are 600, 800,
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:29.440]   or larger than that, that we really want to build a community where God is
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440]   honored.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:35.440]   And God cannot be honored in our lives if we have a personal agenda of just
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.440]   having a few friends around us and we're not aware of what's going on spiritually
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   with the people that are coming in.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.440]   Okay?
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   And so this retreat will serve a great deal for that, I think, effectively, if you
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   choose to do so.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:59.440]   As we've been praying, Dr. Shree is going to be talking about reconciliation.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.440]   When people ask me what's the hardest thing about pastoring, and I think it's no
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   different than being a Christian.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.440]   It's just that I have added pressure because I have to speak in front of you
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   regularly, and if I don't practice this, I will feel like a hypocrite, right?
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   Because what is the greatest command?
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.440]   Love God, and second is like it, right?
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:24.440]   And so the greatest challenge has always been throughout the years is loving
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.440]   people that are hard to love.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.440]   Some of you are much easier to love.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.440]   Some of you are -- require some work, right?
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.440]   And I'm not going to tell you who you are, right?
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.440]   And everybody has some people in their lives that it would be just easy.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.440]   Your life would be so much less stressful if those people weren't around.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.440]   But God places those people in our lives for a reason.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:53.440]   God said -- Jesus said that our primary identity as Christians is to practice the
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.440]   love that he practiced with us, unconditional love, right?
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.440]   Where he loves people who are hard to love, who are difficult to love, that we
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.440]   don't want to love, people who have wronged us.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:10.440]   And so if we don't practice our Christianity there, then everything else we do is hypocrisy.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440]   We can preach the gospel without practicing love.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.440]   He says it's nothing.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.440]   You can speak in tongues.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.440]   You can lead.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   You can even give your body to be burned in the flame if you do not practice love.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.440]   He says it is for nothing.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:28.440]   So at the core of what God calls us to do is to practice this agape love.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:35.440]   It is probably the most sanctifying thing that we can do because it really tears at the core of our being.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.440]   It tears at our pride.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:41.440]   You cannot practice agape love if you retain your pride.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:48.440]   Nothing kills our pride more than practicing love with people who we don't want to practice love with, right?
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:55.440]   Nothing is more sanctifying, but also there's nothing that builds a church more than when a church practices a
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.440]   love that is not practiced outside of the church because they look at our church and they say,
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.440]   "Why are these people together?
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:07.440]   How come they practice this kind of community that's so hard to build outside?"
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.440]   Because we have Christ, right?
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440]   Because the love of Christ compels us.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:18.440]   So I want to encourage you, just like as we've been praying, just like the theme is going to be, that you don't leave
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:24.440]   the retreat with a lot of themes, right, and a lot of, you know, teaching.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.440]   But how do we practice?
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:32.440]   What specific things, what specific people is God convicting you to reconcile with, to practice this love with?
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.440]   And so hopefully throughout the retreat that we may be able to do that, okay?
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.440]   So let me give you some practical things to practice, okay?
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   First of all, while you are here, there's a reason why you have this lanyard or whatever you call this, okay,
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440]   this plastic thing.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.440]   It has your names on it.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:59.440]   If you're like me, you're not like -- I remember your face, but I probably asked some of you,
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440]   maybe some of you have been offended.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:03.440]   I asked you like four or five times, like, "Hey, nice to meet you."
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.440]   You say, "Oh, we've met already," right?
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440]   How many times?
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440]   Like four times.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:14.440]   So at some point, like I'm ashamed to ask because I don't want to offend you,
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:21.440]   so my inclination is to avoid you so that I don't have to be awkward with you.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.440]   So there were long periods of our church growth where I was -- you know, it's because I met that person,
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.440]   but I remember their name, so I'm going to walk this way, right?
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:35.440]   I've come to the conclusion that I can't do that anymore, right?
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:40.440]   It's better for me to offend you and to get to know you, even if it takes me four or five times,
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   than to avoid you because it causes more problems down the line.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.440]   So I want to encourage you to do the same.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.440]   Be awkward.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440]   If you don't remember, you know, just ask them.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   And that's why we have this.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   So I'm going to ask you to do your best while you're here to break the ice.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   You're not going to become best friends through two, three days of retreat,
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:09.440]   but at least when you go back to church that you're not just walking by people, you know,
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.440]   that you can say, hey, I remember you, or you can say, hey, we ate together,
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.440]   or we were in a small group together, or, you know, or we just passed by
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.440]   and happened to be in the same circle while we're talking, that next time you see them at church,
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.440]   that you can ask them, what's your name again?
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.440]   You know what I mean?
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.440]   Even if it takes four or five times, right?
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.440]   Because if the church is going to be built, we have to know each other.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   We have to suffer together.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.440]   We have to celebrate together.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.440]   If we get in the habit of forming our cliques and then we have 20 friends and everybody else I don't know
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   and I don't care to know, then the church is never going to change for you.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   So do your best to get to know as many people as you can while you're here, even if it's awkward.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.440]   I give you permission in the name of the Lord to be awkward at this retreat.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.440]   Be as awkward with as many people as possible while you're here.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.440]   Be deliberate about building friendships while you're here.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.440]   You're not going to be friends with everybody, but in your small group, with other couples,
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:16.440]   when you go out to eat, more than just small talk, if you get in the habit of just asking them,
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.440]   "What's going on in your life?
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.440]   How can I pray for you?"
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.440]   That's a really good way to break the ice.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.440]   And sometimes they'll give you just a general idea and sometimes they'll open up to you.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:32.440]   And so you don't have to do that with everybody, but with the people that you've been assigned,
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.440]   do your best to really connect with them and not just to be in small group, not just to be in dinner,
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.440]   but to really get to know that person so when you come back that you'll have prayer requests to pray for
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   when you go back home.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:47.440]   So I'm going to encourage you to be able to do that.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   Be intentional with your time here.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   We're only here for a few days.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:58.440]   We have one full day tomorrow, and so we deliberately packed the schedule during the day,
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.440]   and then, again, Jason will probably go through more of that later on.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   But what I say to be intentional is if you've been at church for a while and you already have a group of
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:14.440]   friends, and I know that it would be great to revisit with friends and reconnect with friends.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.440]   I haven't been able to spend time with them like that.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.440]   You are surrounded by people who don't have that because our church is growing.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:27.440]   There's so many people who have only been at our church for a month, six months, a year, two years,
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.440]   and so they don't have that kind of connection at church.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.440]   So I want, especially for those of you who have been at our church for a couple years or longer,
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.440]   to be deliberate about people that you don't recognize.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.440]   Reach out to them.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:44.440]   If you see somebody wandering around and you feel like they don't fit in anywhere, you know, be hospitable.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   That's one of the qualities that God calls leaders to be to have hospitality.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.440]   So to be deliberate about your time.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.440]   And along with that, those of you, especially those of you who are younger, okay,
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.440]   and not to say that this doesn't affect older people, but those of you who are younger, you know,
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.440]   you kind of remember retreats as a place to go hang out until 4 in the morning, you know what I mean,
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.440]   have fun, play games, and then you wake up and you're halfway falling asleep through the next session,
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.440]   but you make great friendships that way, right?
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:24.440]   I'm not saying that, you know, like we have curfew at 10 o'clock, you should be home and sleeping,
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   and you wake up 6 in the morning.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.440]   I'm not -- there is no -- we don't have a timeline yet.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.440]   Obviously, the hotel has things that you don't want to disturb other people.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:37.440]   If you're in a hotel room, try not to make noise in the hotel rooms because there's guests next door.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.440]   We don't want them hating Christ because of you, okay?
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.440]   So if you're going to make noise, try to do it in this room.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   But at the same time, we want you to build friendships.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.440]   We want you to, you know, break the ice.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.440]   But our primary reason why we're here is to connect with God, right?
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:01.440]   And so I want you guys to use your judgment, and if you have friends who are not using their judgment,
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   please help them use their judgment, right, and to sleep at a godly time, right?
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:14.440]   And whatever godly means, you use your own judgment, but try to make that your priority, right?
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:22.440]   And, again, we don't have a specific curfew, but try to be reasonable, okay?
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.440]   All right.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.440]   And those of you who are a little bit older, try to stay up as long as you can, okay?
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:35.440]   You're tempted to go in 9 o'clock and just go to sleep, okay?
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.440]   So we're not here for that long.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:45.440]   So try to stay up and to connect with as many people as possible.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.440]   You know who you are, okay?
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.440]   All right.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.440]   And a couple more things.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.440]   Dr. Street, I don't think is here yet, right?
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.440]   Okay.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:02.440]   We've already prayed for the -- you know, every once in a while when I do go to churches to speak,
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.440]   the most awkward time for me is in between, you know, in between
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.440]   because it depends on which church that I'm at, and I just kind of don't know what to do with myself,
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.440]   and so I just kind of float around.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.440]   And so I appreciate it when the people who are there, like, engage me.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.440]   They would ask me questions and just kind of engage them and let them know.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:27.440]   If you've heard something that was really encouraging, you don't have to sit there and, like,
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.440]   and have one-to-one with Dr. Street and his wife, but just say thank you.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.440]   You know, that really encouraged me.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.440]   At the end of the retreat, that day would feel encouraged, right?
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.440]   Even though they may be physically drained, oftentimes I go to churches where they're engaging,
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.440]   and I come back more rejuvenated than when I first went.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.440]   And so I hope that that would be the experience for our speakers as well.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:52.440]   So while they're here, even though they're laboring for us at the end of the retreat,
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.440]   that through our interaction, through us thanking them, engaging them,
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.440]   that they would find encouragement through the time that we have here.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:05.440]   Again, this is something that I'd be encouraging all of us to do.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.440]   And then one final thing before I give this over to Jason.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.440]   The morning devotions that we have, Jason's going to tell us the timeline,
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:20.440]   but again, if you go to sleep at a godly time, you're going to wake up at a godly hour,
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.440]   and then we can have godly devotions, right?
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.440]   You go to bed at an ungodly time, you're not going to wake up at an ungodly hour,
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.440]   and you're going to have ungodly devotion, all right?
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   So your devotion is going to start at sleep.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   Get enough sleep. Some of you guys require less than others.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.440]   And especially those of you who are younger, you are sleeping with other people.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:48.440]   You're in a quad room, and you're like, "Oh, I'm a night owl," but the other three are not, right?
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.440]   So be courteous to other people while you're there,
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:56.440]   and then please try to come early in the morning, wherever you are, to prepare your hearts
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.440]   so that that will set the tone for the rest of the day, right?
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.440]   What you do in the morning is going to set the tone for what you're preparing for the rest of the day.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:09.440]   So if you don't prepare in the morning, you're probably going to have that attitude for the rest of the day.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.440]   So I want to highly encourage you to take that time seriously.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.440]   Make the most of the retreat that we have together, okay?
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.440]   All right. If I can give that to Jason.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:25.440]   [Applause]
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.440]   All right. Thank you, Pastor Peter, for those words of encouragement.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:34.440]   Speaking of morning devotions, guys, so this room will be open at 6.30 a.m.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:40.440]   Morning devotions start at 7 a.m., but it's open at 6.30 a.m. for you guys to come in.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.440]   Breakfast for the volunteers will be open at 7.45 a.m.,
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.440]   but for the rest of everybody else, it's 8 a.m. for you guys to come for breakfast.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.440]   One big announcement. We posted it on the bulletin, and we posted it on Facebook page as well.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:18:02.440]   I believe Sarah notified all the parents, but the nursery seats time tomorrow will extend into Q&A,
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.440]   and Q&A will end at 4.30 approximately.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:10.440]   So parents, please plan accordingly to make sure after the Q&A session ends,
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   you guys hurry up and pick up your kids right after, okay?
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:22.440]   The Oasis area, which is to my right, your left, do not enter that area.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.440]   That's another group that will be here over the same weekend.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.440]   We have from the Rancho Mirage area into the Celebrity Room, okay?
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.440]   Please try not to enter the Oasis area.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:39.440]   And speaking of that, looking around, my observation is that the hotel might be a little bit short-staffed,
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:44.440]   plus due to some restrictions, they're not always going to be here constantly.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:50.440]   So if you guys notice, things are getting a bit messy, you know, like the bathrooms or the trash areas,
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:55.440]   and especially where the snacks are, you know, just try to clean up after yourselves
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.440]   and do everything in a very orderly fashion, especially the snacks area, you guys.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.440]   Don't ravage it. Just wait for one another. Just stand in line.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.440]   And we have plenty of snacks to go around, okay?
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.440]   You guys don't have to worry about any shortages.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.440]   There's a Costco like a mile and a half from here. We'll always get more, okay?
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.440]   And we punish everything.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:23.440]   We have hot water for the ramen right back there for you guys who really love Korean ramen.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:30.440]   Okay, for those of you staying at the Fairfield, please do check in if you haven't done so already.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:35.440]   But I do want to let you know that there's going to be a devotion room for you guys as well,
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.440]   but it's only 25-person max.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   So if you guys--if it fills up fast, you guys can come here,
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:49.440]   or you guys can do devotions in your room or the pool area or the common area in the Fairfield Hotel, okay?
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:57.440]   Lastly, after Peter comes up and does a closing prayer, if all the small group leaders--
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:03.440]   if you are a small group leader and you're here, right after that ends, just please come up real quick.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.440]   For those of you who don't know who your small group leader is,
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:10.440]   you guys can open the Facebook app or go onto the e-mails.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.440]   We've been sending tons of logistical e-mails,
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.440]   and you guys can see or identify from their profile photo that we have for you guys, okay?
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.440]   They'll be standing up here real quick for about--
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.440]   if you guys don't mind just standing around up here for the last few minutes afterwards,
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.440]   that would be greatly appreciated.
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:29.440]   All right, I think that's it.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.440]   Okay, praise team.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:39.440]   Okay, so as the praise team comes up, let's all rise from our seats together.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.440]   Please join me in a word of prayer as we pray over our church as a whole,
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.440]   and then we'll close off the evening with one song that we'll sing to the Lord.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.440]   So let's pray.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.440]   God, beyond just this weekend,
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:57.440]   Pastor Peter gave us this challenge and encouragement thinking about the growth of our church.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.440]   And, Lord, we know that you are our Heavenly Father,
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:06.440]   and you see the church as your spiritual family with us being your children.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:12.440]   And so, God, I pray that we would see it as such a joy to be in your house,
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:17.440]   and, God, the brothers and sisters that we have, we ought to love one another as you have loved us.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:21.440]   And so, God, with the application then being not just one thing,
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.440]   but, God, in our hearts' attitude, help us, Lord, to edify and build each other up
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.440]   with a kind of conviction, Lord, we are a part of the same household of God.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.440]   And so, Lord, we lift up our entire church to you, not just this weekend,
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.440]   but for the years ahead as we grow, that we would grow in the right way,
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.440]   Lord, that it would reflect truly your design.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.440]   We thank you, Lord, and lift this song up to you. It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:04.440]   How great the chasm that lay between us
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:11.440]   How high the mountain I could not climb
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:18.440]   In desperation I turned to heaven
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:25.440]   Spoke your name into the night
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:32.440]   Then through the darkness your loving kindness
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:39.440]   Tore through the shadows of my soul
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:46.440]   The work is finished, the end is written
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:54.440]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:57.440]   You're my living hope
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:04.440]   Who could imagine so great a mercy
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:11.440]   What heart could cleave such boundless grace
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:18.440]   The God of ages stepped down from glory
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:25.440]   To wear my sin and bear my shame
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:33.440]   The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:40.440]   The King of kings calls me his own
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:48.440]   Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:55.440]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:03.440]   Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:10.440]   Hallelujah, death has passed this free morning
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:14.440]   You have broken every chain
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.440]   There's salvation in your name
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:25.440]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:35.440]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:42.440]   Your buried body began to breathe
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:50.440]   Out of the silence the roaring lion
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:57.440]   Declared the grave has no claim on me
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:04.440]   Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:12.440]   Your buried body began to breathe
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:19.440]   Out of the silence the roaring lion
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   Declared the grave has no claim on me
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:34.440]   Jesus, yours is the victory
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.440]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:44.440]   Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:51.440]   Hallelujah, death has passed this free morning
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.440]   You have broken every chain
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.440]   There's salvation in your name
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:04.440]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:12.440]   Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:19.440]   Hallelujah, death has passed this free morning
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.440]   You have broken every chain
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.440]   There's salvation in your name
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:33.440]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:40.440]   Jesus Christ, my living hope
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.440]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:51.440]   God, you are my living hope
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:58.440]   All right, let's say one final prayer.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.440]   Our God, we want to place all of our faith and our hope in you.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.440]   And Lord, we will pray, Father God, again for this weekend.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.440]   We pray that you would make the most of all the opportunities that we have.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.440]   And in so doing, Lord God, I truly honor you.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.440]   We thank you, God, it's in Christ, and we pray, amen.
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.440]   All right, everybody, we hope that you have some godly rest at a godly time.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.440]   And then see you in the morning at 7.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:27.440]   Small group leaders, please make sure that you come up here for a brief moment
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.440]   so that we can make sure to introduce you guys.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:34.440]   So if the small group leaders could quickly come up.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.440]   We'll give you a few minutes.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.440]   For any of you guys who don't know which small group you belong to,
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:49.440]   take a quick glance up here to see who they are.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.440]   I'm going to go through their names so that you guys--
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.440]   just in case you don't know what they look like.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:09.440]   On the left, we have Paul Pack, Mitchell Kim, Rachel Kang, Luke Kang, Sean Tang,
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:15.440]   Pastor Nate Kwok, Richard Lee, James Hong,
