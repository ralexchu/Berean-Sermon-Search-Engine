[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:23.560]   All right, let me explain.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.900]   As you guys are coming in, I'm going to keep explaining.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.980]   If you are sitting on one of these seats,
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.680]   it's with the expectation that you're going to be on the ground
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.380]   when we pray.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.100]   If for whatever the reason that you can't get on the ground,
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.220]   you will be sitting in the back or in the back,
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.420]   the other, in the room area.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.220]   So if you are sitting here, it's with the understanding
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.140]   that you will be.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980]   And then this front area is going to be used for prayer.
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.660]   We're going to be asking later on if you want to be prayed for
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.420]   or you're going to walk around and pray for others,
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.700]   we're going to ask you to come to this area.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.260]   So as you're coming in, I'm going to keep explaining.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.860]   So make sure that people--
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.220]   and you're going to have to sit because we only have set up
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.140]   just enough chairs.
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.780]   So you will have nobody in between you,
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.580]   meaning that you can't have your Bibles or your stuff
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.780]   sitting next to you to create a gap.
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.060]   So don't put anything other than the person on the seat.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.600]   Unless you're saving it for somebody,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.140]   somebody is going to come and sit.
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.540]   So every seat is going to be taken that is set up right now,
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.260]   just to give you a heads up, including the front.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.740]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.740]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.740]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.420]   We need some of you to sit in the front row,
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.340]   the very front row to the left or to the right.
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.340]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.340]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.340]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.340]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.340]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.340]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.340]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.140]   So basically, we start at 7, what, 735?
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.940]   And I'm going to go probably about 25, 30 minutes each.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.340]   About 25, 30 minutes.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.220]   And then I'm going to just have them pray.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.940]   I'm going to explain that and pray.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.020]   And then 10 minutes before the end,
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.660]   Pastor Nate, Pastor Mark, and I, Peter, and I, each one of us
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.140]   are going to come represent us in prayer.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.020]   And that will be it.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.220]   So the third one I pray, that will be it.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.820]   I'm going to--
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.620]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.700]   Yeah, closing something, and then that will be it.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.700]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.140]   So mine will be the closing prayer.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.140]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.140]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.140]   I'm not coming in on that all.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.140]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.640]   (chattering)
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.220]   (gentle music)
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.640]   (chattering)
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.060]   (chattering)
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.640]   (gentle music)
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.060]   (chattering)
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.640]   (gentle music)
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.060]   (chattering)
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.640]   (gentle music)
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.060]   (chattering)
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.540]   (gentle music)
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.960]   (chattering)
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.540]   (gentle music)
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.960]   (chattering)
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.120]   (gentle music)
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.960]   (chattering)
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.120]   (gentle music)
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.960]   (chattering)
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.120]   (gentle music)
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.960]   (chattering)
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.120]   (gentle music)
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.960]   (chattering)
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.540]   - All right, as you guys are coming in,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.540]   I'm gonna explain, if you are sitting up here
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.040]   in any of the front, the brown chairs,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.700]   that's with the understanding that when we're having time
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.620]   to pray that you're gonna be on the ground.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.420]   And for whatever reason, you can't
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.500]   or you're not expected to do that,
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.340]   you can sit in the back area or in the back room, okay?
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.780]   And because we don't have enough chairs,
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.380]   there is no space, okay?
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.380]   So if you have bag on a seat that you're not gonna sit in,
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.180]   can you please put it underneath your seat?
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.880]   Because unless you're saving it for somebody, okay?
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.000]   So we don't have enough space,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.800]   so every seat is going to be taken.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.080]   If you do have small children
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.340]   that won't be participating in the prayer,
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.460]   if you can help us by not taking those seats
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.140]   and sitting in the white chair somewhere
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.940]   so that when it's time for prayer,
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.740]   okay, yeah, you're gonna have to take,
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.740]   every seat is gonna be taken,
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.300]   and then there's gonna be overflow in the white chairs, okay?
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.300]   So if you feel awkward with the person sitting next to you,
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.640]   you're gonna have to get over it today, okay?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.940]   Every seat's gonna be taken, okay?
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.860]   There's some front seats here
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.700]   for the people who are coming in a little bit later.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.860]   Please come sit in the front up here, okay?
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.640]   Over there, oh, there's people there already, okay.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.100]   We're gonna give it a few more minutes
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.940]   before we get started,
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.680]   but if we can have some people sit up in the front here
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.340]   as you're coming in,
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.080]   because we need to fill these front side.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.820]   Again, every seat's gonna be taken,
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.880]   so if you have a seat in between you
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.880]   hoping no one will sit, it's not gonna happen.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.580]   Might as well choose who you're gonna sit next to, okay?
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.060]   So if there is a seat next to you
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.720]   with nobody sitting there, please fill those seats.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.540]   Again, as I said, we only have about,
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.660]   I don't know how many, 100, 200 chairs,
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.300]   and we usually have over 300, okay?
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.060]   Which means people who are coming in late
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.760]   are gonna have to sit on the white chairs,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.180]   and then I'll explain.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:54.760]   If later on, and I'm gonna explain again one more time,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.840]   the front space here is left for prayer,
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.540]   where we're gonna ask later on
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.540]   if you want to be prayed for to come up to the front,
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.780]   and if you wanna just kinda move around
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.700]   and freely pray for other people,
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.140]   we're gonna ask you to come up to the front.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.800]   So if you are planning to do that,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.620]   sit closer to the front, okay?
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.380]   So when I ask you to come,
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.980]   you guys can be easier to come to the front, okay?
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.040]   Like I said, every seat's gonna be taken,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.300]   so if you are coming in,
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.820]   let's say if you're sitting by yourself
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.380]   and there's two spaces next to you,
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.460]   or there's one in between and one in between,
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.460]   can you guys kinda scoot over
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.660]   so we can make space for other people?
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.500]   Okay.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:49.800]   And if we can have the service team who'll set up the chairs,
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.060]   if you guys can go get some more white chairs,
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.760]   we're gonna run out of chairs, okay?
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:01.200]   I don't know if the other team is out getting chairs.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.980]   So just have the chairs ready back there, okay?
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.740]   (faint speaking)
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:18.100]   There's two seats up in the front here.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.980]   Is that open?
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.380]   It's open, okay.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.080]   There's two seats up in the front.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:30.580]   If you guys have seats in between, can you scoot over?
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.540]   Okay?
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.740]   If you have seats next to you that nobody's sitting in,
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.300]   can you scoot over all the way?
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.580]   Unless you're saving that seat for somebody.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:50.660]   There's a couple seats here.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.860]   There's a few seats here.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.940]   Okay, there's some...
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.700]   Okay.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.200]   Okay, come on in.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.940]   (faint speaking)
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:09.920]   Yeah, so later on, when we get on the ground to pray,
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.000]   you can just, we can just move out the white seats.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.440]   So we'll put more white seats in the back.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.080]   There are still seats here.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.880]   There's two seats over there.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.560]   Okay.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.640]   There's two seats over there,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.240]   and there's two seats over here.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.080]   Okay.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:34.320]   Is that seat taken right there?
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.160]   It's taken?
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.880]   This seat right there, is it taken?
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.720]   Okay.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.000]   Yeah, there's some seats over here,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.460]   so come on in, fill it in.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:50.960]   As I said, we are gonna run out of seats,
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.360]   and I deliberately made it uncomfortable, so.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.400]   (faint speaking)
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   This is planned.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.780]   Okay.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.080]   Try to find seats somewhere,
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.720]   or sit on the white chair for now.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.920]   You can grab the white chairs
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.320]   and put it, go onto the sides too.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.280]   If the back there is crowded,
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.600]   you can just grab the white chairs,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.720]   and there's some space in the left,

[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.400]   (congregation applauding)
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.980]   (bell tolling)
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:20.200]   If I can have the lights turned on.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.120]   For prayer time we'll keep it like this,
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.400]   but okay, that's good.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:33.840]   So I know some of you guys were wondering
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.360]   why did I all of a sudden want to do this?
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.040]   And some of you guys were probably grumbling,
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.360]   why is he making us get on the ground?
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.360]   So I'm gonna give my case for it
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.760]   and then you can grumble afterwards.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:53.760]   So let me just kind of give you a breakdown
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.480]   of what's gonna happen tonight.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.360]   After I give my exhortation and explanation,
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.680]   we're gonna take some time afterwards
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.200]   to pray and hopefully you brought something.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.920]   If you didn't bring anything, you have good news,
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.200]   you should be fine.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.560]   Otherwise, take off your jacket
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.520]   and then you can put it down, okay?
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.280]   If you don't have anything.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.200]   And those of you who can't for physical reasons
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.160]   or whatever, you guys can just kind of pray in your seat
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.280]   so it's not like you have to do this.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.320]   And then about halfway through,
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.800]   you're gonna have about 40 minutes to pray,
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.920]   but in the halfway mark, our praise team's gonna come up
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.360]   and they're gonna lead us in one song.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.720]   And then after that, we're gonna invite people to come up
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.280]   in this front area, okay?
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.080]   And if you would like for the leadership
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.040]   to come and pray for you,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   you can come up in the front and we'll ask you briefly,
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.600]   how would you want us to pray for you?
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.400]   Then afterwards, you can either go back to your seat
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.400]   or you can stay up here and pray for one another, okay?
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.840]   You can move around and pray for your friends
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.160]   and pray for your family members.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.280]   And it doesn't have to be limited to up here.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.040]   You can move around and if people are praying,
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.200]   there's plenty of,
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.360]   there should be plenty of room to move around.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.480]   So that's how it's going to be.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.320]   That's how we're gonna be doing that.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:22.240]   Are you guys not gonna go down there?
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.080]   Okay, they're gonna stay here,
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.160]   so don't pretend like they're not here, all right?
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.320]   Second Chronicles 7, 13 to 15.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.600]   This is a text that we're gonna be looking at.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.560]   If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain,
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.120]   or if I command the locusts to devour the land,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.360]   or if I send pestilence among my people,
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.320]   and if my people who are called by my name
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.360]   humble themselves and pray,
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.880]   and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.280]   then I will hear from heaven.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.200]   I will forgive their sin, heal their land.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.360]   Now my eyes will be open to the ears,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.800]   attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.040]   So let me pray for us.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.880]   (pastor whispers)
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.960]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your grace.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.200]   We pray for devotion.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.640]   I know, Father God, that every soul in this room
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.720]   has urgent things to pray for,
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.200]   whether we feel they are urgent or not.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.480]   Help us, Lord God, to make this a house of prayer.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.880]   So give us strength, give us insight
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.680]   that we may draw closer to you.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:40.440]   So why am I asking you to kneel today for prayer?
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.160]   This may be strange to you,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.240]   but it is not strange to the world.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.760]   And it may be strange to us,
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.600]   but it is not strange to previous generations.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.160]   The way we pray is uniquely us,
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.560]   uniquely this generation, it is uniquely Western.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.880]   If you do any traveling,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.160]   you'll notice that predominantly kneeling prayer
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.880]   is the most common way that people do pray.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.600]   So we're the ones who are oddballs, to be honest,
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.120]   not the norm.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.440]   I'm gonna give you three reasons
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.920]   why I'm gonna ask you to pray.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.120]   And I'm not saying that from this day forward
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.800]   that when you pray or when we pray
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.480]   that we're gonna pray this way,
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   but for the purpose of understanding
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.400]   why we're doing this today,
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.360]   I'm gonna give you three things from this text.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.140]   First of all, it is a posture of desperation.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:37.280]   The text that we read is the dedication of the temple.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.080]   And God says to Israel, "If I shut up the heavens."
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.760]   He doesn't say if it just shuts up.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.200]   He doesn't say if famine comes or the rain doesn't come.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.720]   He said, "If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain,
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.720]   "or if I command the locusts to devour the land,
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.280]   "or if I send pestilence among my people."
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.480]   In other words, when you realize how desperate you are.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.080]   When I put you in a position where you have to pray,
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.200]   when I allow certain things to happen in your life,
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.240]   when I withhold certain things that you are desperate for,
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.040]   when I do this, and he says, "Why does he do this?"
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.540]   In order to get our attention.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.340]   In order to get our attention, he says,
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.640]   "When you recognize your desperation," he says,
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.560]   "then you come to pray."
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.000]   The truth of the matter is,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.940]   we don't need a famine to be desperate.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:38.600]   We don't need to be having financial problems
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.680]   or to get sick.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:46.000]   I know for a fact that every single one of you
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.040]   has something that you're desperate for.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.000]   Every single one of you.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.160]   Now, it may not look different, it may not sound different,
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.320]   but every single one of us do.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.440]   Maybe you are aware of it.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.800]   Some of you have just come to accept it.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.640]   Now, there may be other things in your life,
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.200]   but there's two things that are very specific
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.920]   that he says that we need to be desperate for.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.200]   And that is, we need to be desperate to conquer our sins.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.520]   In 1 Thessalonians 4.3, it says,
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.960]   "For this is the will of God."
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.840]   I mean, how often do you pray for the Lord's will?
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.960]   Am I gonna marry this person?
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.040]   Should I go to that school?
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.480]   What should I do?
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.560]   But here it says clearly, "This is the will of God."
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.200]   This is the will of God.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   As much as we pray for his will and job and circumstance,
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.040]   relationships, the Bible does not make clear
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:45.880]   who you ought to marry.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.240]   The Bible does not make clear what job you ought to have,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.720]   where you should go.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.600]   But this is clear.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.440]   "This is my will," he says,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.040]   "that your sanctification, your holiness,
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.960]   "that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality."
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:06.360]   That is not a wish, that is not a suggestion.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.720]   He said it is his will.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.560]   Now, especially because our church is young,
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.800]   and you don't have to be young to be struggling with this.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.120]   I think in our generation, one of the primary ways
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.640]   that you are being attacked, that we are being attacked,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.200]   is sexual promiscuity, whether with your body,
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.000]   with your eyes, with your thoughts, with your ears.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.680]   Sexual immorality is so rampant in our generation
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.320]   that every single church, every single Christian
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.680]   has been in some way compromised.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:44.160]   And the scary thing is, most churches and most Christians
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.800]   have just accepted that that's normal.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.600]   It is not.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.120]   It is not the will of God.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:59.120]   If you're sitting here because of habitual sexual sin,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.280]   you are desperate.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:07.700]   You sought out counsel, accountability, read books,
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.720]   but you are desperate.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.960]   You need the power of God.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.400]   You need the power of God.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.280]   You are desperate.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.440]   Hebrews chapter 12 where it says,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.680]   therefore, since we have so a greater cloud
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.840]   of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.620]   every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.000]   The sexual sin, and again, it's not the only sin,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.640]   but the sexual sin so easily entangled.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.760]   You don't have to do much.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   You don't have to seek it out.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.200]   You don't have to be determined.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.460]   It comes looking for you.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:47.260]   It says every encumbrance, everything that leads you there,
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.360]   everything that causes you to compromise,
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.000]   he says lay it aside and let us run with endurance
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.240]   the race that is set before us.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.360]   This sin is so serious, he says in Hebrews chapter four,
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.880]   you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.720]   in your striving against sin.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.360]   How have we allowed in our generation
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.720]   that sexual immorality is so casual
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.040]   that it's spoken of even up in the pulpit, even pastors?
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.360]   Like it's just art.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.140]   Everybody struggles with it.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.300]   What God desires is that you feel bad.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.780]   No, it is not the will of God.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.760]   We are desperate.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.620]   And so kneeling before the Lord
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.460]   is a posture of desperation, to pray with desperation.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.260]   Lord, help me, deliver me.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.860]   I want to conquer this sin.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.280]   I want to conquer this sin.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.860]   I am begging you to help me to conquer this sin.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.400]   This evening when we pray, we get on our knees
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.160]   and we should be in a posture of desperation,
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.240]   crying out to God for help.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:10.580]   When you're desperate, you don't come to the Lord casually.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.180]   When you're desperate, you don't pray casually.
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.840]   You don't approach him casually.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:23.720]   We need to be desperate about those who are lost.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:29.900]   We say we believe this.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.560]   And there's people that you love.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   I mean, you love them.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.900]   Your mom, your dad, your brother, your sister,
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.620]   your son, your daughter.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.220]   You love them.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.800]   You would give your life for them.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.600]   You love them so much.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.320]   But how desperate are you in prayer for them?
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.480]   We need to be desperate.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.520]   And even if they're not our brothers,
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.260]   even if they're not loved ones,
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:07.520]   even if they may be people that we don't even like,
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.320]   he says, "Not much as it is appointed
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.460]   "for all men to die once.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.280]   "After this comes judgment."
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.860]   This is not a slap on the hands.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.600]   This is not time out.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.440]   He says it's eternal fire, gnashing of teeth.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.920]   And there is no relief.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.280]   We need to be desperate.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.680]   When we pray for our loved ones,
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.620]   that we don't pray casually, we don't pray like,
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.060]   if you answer it, okay, if you don't answer it, that's fine.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.900]   No, we need to pray in such a way
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.900]   where I cannot stop praying until you answer my prayers.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:55.720]   So when we kneel, it is a position of desperation.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:03.080]   If, knowing all of that, your heart has become so hardened,
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.060]   you're doing Bible study, memorizing Scripture,
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.200]   you're part of church,
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.580]   but you're not desperate to pray for them.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:16.920]   And pray for desperation of your own heart.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.000]   Something has gone seriously wrong.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.220]   And we can confess this and feel nothing for the lost.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:30.360]   So if you can't pray desperately
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.400]   for your family and friends who don't know Christ,
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.760]   then you need to be praying desperately for yourself,
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.920]   'cause you are the one who is in need of prayer.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.700]   So whether we are praying for our loved ones
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.660]   or whether we are praying for ourselves,
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.680]   we need to pray with desperation.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.640]   Secondly, it is a posture of humility.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.000]   It says, if my people were called by my name,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.600]   when you recognize your desperation,
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.520]   if you're called by my name,
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.460]   and humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.580]   and turn from their wicked ways,
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.860]   it says we need to humble ourselves.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.780]   Okay?
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.380]   So kneeling is a posture of humility,
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:16.980]   that we are coming not to simply banker or friend,
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.500]   but it says to the throne of grace.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.460]   The reason why we're coming to him
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.820]   is because he is above us.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.180]   He's greater than us in authority and in power and in honor.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:36.540]   And so our posture should represent humility.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:41.140]   So he says, if my people, he didn't just just pray,
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.840]   but he says humble themselves and pray,
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.320]   that we are coming to the throne.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:53.300]   In our indesperations, in our culture,
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   everything has become so casual, especially in California,
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.140]   that sometimes we give more consideration and respect
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.820]   to Starbucks barista.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.900]   How do we address them?
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:05.860]   How do we talk to them?
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.900]   We don't want to offend them.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.320]   And yet we don't give a much thought
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.180]   about approaching the throne of God.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.020]   You know the word glory?
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.220]   Bible says all have sinned and fall short
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.340]   of the glory of God.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.900]   Glory basically literally means weighty, something serious.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:30.060]   So if salvation is to be restored to that glory,
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.260]   means for his children to recognize the weightiness
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.860]   of his presence in our lives.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:40.100]   Weightiness of what it is that we are actually doing.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.900]   We are coming in the presence of a thrice holy God,
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.700]   desperate for him to answer our prayers.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:53.540]   Sometimes our casualness in the way that we approach God
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.700]   already nullifies what we're going to pray for.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:03.540]   Because it already establishes that we don't know
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.580]   who we're praying to.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.660]   Even before we utter a single word,
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:14.740]   we already are projecting that this time of prayer
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:21.260]   is without recognition that it is in the presence
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.700]   of a thrice holy God.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:27.660]   You know in Africa, they say that one of the most
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.460]   dangerous animals are hippos.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.580]   You know people say, you got lions there,
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.020]   you got all kinds of dangerous animals,
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.140]   but it's hippos.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.780]   And the reason why the hippos are so dangerous
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.420]   is because people don't think it's dangerous.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.540]   So if any of you have ever been to Africa,
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.940]   you'll see hippos just roaming around,
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.780]   just randomly in some lake.
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:55.380]   And you may be tempted to go near to the hippo.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.820]   And that's how most people get bitten or killed by hippos.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.140]   Hippos are very territorial.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.340]   So they're docile, they're slow,
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:11.100]   you know they're always almost moving in slow motion.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.300]   But their bite has 2,000 pounds,
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.980]   twice the strength of an average lion.
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.860]   They said that they can get up to a speed
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.540]   of 19 miles per hour.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.700]   So when they want to move, they can move.
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:29.140]   And they said an average adult male athlete,
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.580]   average, runs about 18 and a half miles.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.860]   So again, average.
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:39.140]   Meaning a hippo can easily run down if it gets angry.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.140]   And that's the reason why so many people die,
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.340]   because they don't recognize the danger of the hippo.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.380]   When we come to the Lord in prayer,
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:54.700]   many in our generation do not recognize
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.860]   who we're praying to.
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.900]   There's a casualness about coming to him
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.140]   that causes us
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:10.300]   to be reckless with our words,
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.780]   the content of our prayer.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:17.500]   And sometimes we pray for other people to hear
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.220]   in the presence of a holy God.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:23.500]   First Corinthians 3, 16 and 17,
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.620]   Paul says to the Corinthian church,
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.420]   because they were in fighting,
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.940]   and their pride was getting in the way,
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.740]   and the way to warn them about what they were doing
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.100]   and the consequence, he says,
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.700]   do you not know that you are the temple of God,
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.780]   and that the spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:48.540]   In other words, do you understand what your gathering is?
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.820]   Do you understand what your salvation means?
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.860]   Do you understand what union with Christ means?
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.260]   Do you understand what has happened to you?
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.580]   That that holy God
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.020]   that you could not
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.220]   even approach
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.180]   now is dwelling in you.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.580]   In other words,
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.220]   understand the weightiness
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.780]   of what it is that you have.
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.620]   If any man destroys the temple of God,
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.620]   God will destroy him.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.980]   Just as Jesus was jealous for his father's house,
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.940]   he says, God is jealous
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.780]   for the church.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.820]   For the temple of God is holy,
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.980]   and that is what you are.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.220]   So we kneel because we are desperate,
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.340]   and we kneel because we recognize who it is
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.820]   that we are coming to.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.660]   Thirdly,
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.540]   the kneeling is a posture of devotion.
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.860]   That we're dedicated to do this.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.780]   We're not just doing this because it's Friday.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.500]   We're not doing this 'cause my other plans fell out
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.540]   or everybody else is kinda doing it.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.980]   We need to be committed to pray.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:08.260]   Jacob,
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.580]   the name of Jacob
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.900]   means one who wrestles with God.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.820]   You think that was by accident?
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.100]   That God named him that?
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.220]   The one who wrestles with God
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:25.660]   because God wants his people to wrestle,
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.500]   to seek him
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.540]   with all their heart,
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.540]   to want nothing more
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:32.980]   than to have him near,
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:37.100]   to be desperate for him more than anything else.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.380]   And so his story teaches us
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.860]   to be wrestling with God,
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:46.180]   to contend with God.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.820]   Proverbs 8, 17, it says,
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:49.980]   I love those who love me
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.100]   and those who diligently love me.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.700]   Diligently seek me, will find me.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.620]   It doesn't say those who simply find,
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:56.460]   look for him,
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.260]   it's diligently seek him.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:02.580]   Kneeling is a posture of devotion.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.860]   I'm going to pray.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.660]   I'm going to seek him out.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.140]   Jeremiah 29, 13,
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.260]   you will seek me and find me
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.820]   when you search me with all your heart.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.180]   Not just when you're alert,
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.540]   not just when you're not tired,
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.620]   not just when you're young,
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.500]   not just when you're healthy,
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.620]   not just when you're not distracted,
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.180]   but with all your heart.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:28.820]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.220]   Don't say it out loud,
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.500]   but I want you to think it to yourself.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:37.420]   I can't pray when or if.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:40.780]   And finish that sentence in your mind.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:46.580]   I can't pray when or if.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:50.420]   Let me ask you another question.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:56.420]   I can't go to work when or if.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:03.260]   I can't care for my kids when or if.
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:10.500]   Or I can't go to church when or if.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:16.340]   I can't study the Bible when or if.
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.580]   Now I pose that question to you
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:24.420]   because of all the things I presented to you,
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:28.060]   the easiest thing for us to neglect is prayer.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:34.260]   Because we say, "I can't pray because I'm tired.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:39.500]   "I can't pray because I'm too old.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.100]   "I can't pray because it's too late.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.420]   "I can't pray because there's not enough time.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.700]   "I can't pray because there's too many people around me.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.300]   "I can't pray because it's too noisy.
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.380]   "I can't pray because there's a lot of children around me.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.860]   "I can't pray because I gotta make breakfast.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.980]   "I can't pray because I have to read my Bible."
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.940]   And it doesn't take much for us to fill in those blanks
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.860]   and say, "I can't pray because."
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:11.260]   But imagine if we were that easily
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.020]   thwarted from our path and say,
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.620]   "I can't take care of my kids if they don't listen to me.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:21.340]   "I can't feed my kids if they don't wake up in time.
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.580]   "I can't take them to school
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:25.900]   "if they don't put on the right socks.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.820]   "I can't go to church if it rains.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:32.260]   "I can't go to church if my car has some problems."
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.500]   Imagine what the rest of our life would look like
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.660]   if we so easily gave in.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:43.100]   With every other thing that we consider important,
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:48.020]   we push ourselves, we make it work,
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.740]   because not doing it is not acceptable.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:55.700]   Prayer, of all the things that I have mentioned,
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.060]   should be on the top.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.780]   I have to pray.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:03.100]   I have to pray.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:08.740]   And that's why we are devoting ourselves
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.540]   to pray this evening.
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.980]   Don't pray for things that you don't care about.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:20.060]   Don't make a list of things to pray and check it off
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:22.100]   and you don't really care,
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.260]   not really if God answers this or not.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.540]   Pray for things that matter to you,
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.980]   even if it's just one thing.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.420]   When you come before the Lord
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.420]   and you're gonna petition God Almighty,
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.220]   make sure it matters.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:45.220]   So this evening, when we come to God in prayer,
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:49.740]   recognize the desperation.
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:54.180]   Humble ourselves before the Lord.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.860]   You're not doing it for me,
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.700]   you're not doing it for each other,
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.820]   but before God, and be committed,
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.780]   committed to pray.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.060]   If you fall asleep, go get a drink.
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:11.220]   If you don't know and your mind keeps wandering,
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.940]   persevere, remember scripture.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:18.220]   If your knees hurt, get up and stretch or come back.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:22.500]   If people around you are praying too loud
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.180]   and it's bothering you, move away.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.500]   But don't stop praying.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.540]   Be devoted to pray.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:35.180]   So let me ask you, those of you who are able
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:37.100]   to get on your knees.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.420]   Again, I'm not mandating this.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:48.500]   To commit yourself to pray this morning.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:54.540]   And if I can have the lights turned down.
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:59.740]   And I want you to really search your heart.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:04.460]   What is it that you need to pray for?
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.220]   If you're struggling in sin,
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:12.300]   and you become callous,
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:17.380]   cry out to God.
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:23.220]   I am desperate, help me Lord, help me.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.180]   I'm so sick and tired.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.060]   I'm desperate.
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.980]   Cry out to God.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:35.900]   If you have a loved one in your family,
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:38.500]   that do not know the Lord.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.340]   If that doesn't make you desperate,
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.940]   what's gonna make you desperate?
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:48.660]   Come before the Lord and cry out.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:54.660]   Don't worry about what other people are gonna think.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:58.700]   Don't let the thoughts of pride prevent you
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.180]   from crying out to God.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.100]   If you wanna pray out loud, pray out loud.
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.100]   Don't worry about the people around you.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.540]   Show God that you mean business.
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.700]   Let him hear you.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:18.860]   And cry, cry out.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:24.460]   Let me start us off.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.820]   And I'll give you the rest of the time to pray.
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:28.980]   And as I mentioned,
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:32.980]   later on I'll invite you to come
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.020]   if you wanna be prayed for.
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:39.300]   Heavenly Father, we come before you
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.820]   because we are desperate.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:47.460]   Lord, we live in such lives of comfort.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:50.620]   There's no war, there's no persecution.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:54.100]   We have warm houses our children are taken care of.
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.340]   And because of that,
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:01.060]   sometimes we forget how desperate we are.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:06.420]   So please, Lord, open our eyes, soften our hearts,
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.020]   remind us of our desperation
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.540]   so that we would pray with a sense of urgency.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:15.300]   Help us, Lord God, to humble ourselves before your throne.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.580]   That you are a God of power.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.980]   You created this universe.
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:21.780]   If you will, you can do anything.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:25.460]   Help us, Lord God, to pray in such a way
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:29.140]   that we recognize that who we are meeting.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.940]   Help us, Lord, to be devoted to pray.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:35.820]   Not to simply put in our time,
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:38.580]   not to simply go down the list of things,
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:41.540]   but with desperation, with urgency.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:45.180]   Help us to learn to pray with endurance.
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.940]   So we entrust this time to you
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:54.180]   and ask for your Holy Spirit to groan
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:57.820]   with words that we cannot understand
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:02.260]   on our behalf, that you would teach us how to pray.
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.380]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.900]   Let's pray.

[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:59.100]   then Pastor Nate is going to come and pray
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:03.100]   for the theme of our church, evangelism and prayer.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:06.100]   And then Pastor Peter is going to come and pray
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:07.100]   for our Sunday worship,
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.100]   for the ministry that's going on in our church.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:14.100]   And then I will pray for the leaders of our country
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:18.100]   and wrap us up in prayer before our worship team leads us.
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:20.100]   So if I can invite Pastor Nate to come.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.100]   All right, let's pray.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:39.100]   Father, we gather because we have nowhere else to turn.
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:45.100]   And we pray to you, Father, because we are so weak.
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:53.100]   And God, we cry out to you and we are desperate for you
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:58.100]   because you are all we want and you're all we need.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:02.100]   And Lord, as we come to you in prayer,
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:05.100]   as that's been our desire for years now,
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:11.100]   God, we take a look and wonder at how far we've come
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:15.100]   and we look and see at the state of our own hearts.
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:20.100]   And God, we lay ourselves down again
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:22.100]   and say again how much we need you.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.100]   Father, would you continue to work in our hearts
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:30.100]   to change us, that our prayers might be heavy
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:35.100]   with the entirety of our hearts.
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:42.100]   And so God, we pray that we would be a church that prays.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:47.100]   And Father, that it would not be an emotion-filled night.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:52.100]   It would be the breath that's in us.
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:58.100]   And God, I pray for our theme,
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:03.100]   that not only in just prayer for all the things that we need,
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.100]   but God, that we would be ever expanding
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.100]   into a heart that resembles yours.
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:11.100]   God, that our prayers would be your kingdom come
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:12.100]   and your will be done.
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:15.100]   That our prayers would not be just what I want
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:16.100]   or what my heart is filled with,
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:18.100]   but it would be what your heart is filled with.
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:21.100]   And God, that we would look upon the words
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.100]   that you've penned in your word
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.100]   and that we would have that heart.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:28.100]   And God, that you would cause us to open up our lips
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.100]   and it would be the things that you want,
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.100]   that you desire salvation to fall upon this world.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:37.100]   And so God, we pray that we would be a church
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:40.100]   that builds this kind of culture,
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.100]   that has that kind of heartbeat,
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.100]   that sharing the gospel, Lord,
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:50.100]   would come out because it is squeezed out of us.
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:53.100]   Father, that's what we want,
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.100]   because that's what you want.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:57.100]   And God, as we pray to you,
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:00.100]   I pray that our hearts would change more towards yours
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.100]   and that we wouldn't draw you towards ours.
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:06.100]   Father, we pray that our church
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:11.100]   would do evangelism and would share the gospel
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:14.100]   because it is not just something theoretical
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:16.100]   that we are called to do in obedience,
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:20.100]   but it would be an overflow of our hearts.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:25.100]   God, that our prayers to you in evangelism
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:27.100]   would be desire-filled,
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:30.100]   that it will be because we see you clearly,
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:32.100]   we know what you want, we know who you are.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:36.100]   Father, that we would see so clearly your beauty,
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:38.100]   your worth, your value.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:43.100]   And God, that we would so long for this world
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:45.100]   to see that of our God.
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:49.100]   We pray, God, that our sharing of the gospel
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:52.100]   would be personal and not theoretical,
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:55.100]   that it will overflow out of our love for you.
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:59.100]   God, that we would be speaking to people
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:00.100]   of the God we love,
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:03.100]   of the God who's changed us,
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:04.100]   who's changed our lives,
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.100]   who's opened our eyes,
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.100]   who's been gracious to me,
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.100]   who's been compassionate and kind to me.
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:12.100]   God, that it wouldn't be just apologetics.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.100]   Lord, it would be intimate to us
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:17.100]   that those around us might see
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:20.100]   the impact you've made in our lives,
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.100]   that you have upended us,
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.100]   that you have wrecked us,
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:26.100]   that you have changed us,
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   and that every desire of our hearts
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:30.100]   now go along a different flow.
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:35.100]   We pray, God, that we would not be ashamed of the gospel,
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:39.100]   that we would not operate out of a fear of man.
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:42.100]   God, that we look up at you
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.100]   and not just see a great God,
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.100]   but a fearsome God,
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:47.100]   a God who hates sin.
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:51.100]   And so when we come across people,
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.100]   we would not just be trying to win over people
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:56.100]   with winsome words that are so contrived,
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:59.100]   but Lord, that we would present a God who hates sin,
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:03.100]   and God, that we won't shirk back in fear
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.100]   towards what they might think of us,
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:09.100]   that we would not be so afraid of how we might be seen,
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:12.100]   but Lord, that we would be pleading with people
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.100]   to turn away from their sin and to repent
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:19.100]   and to confess before a God whose judgment is coming.
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:23.100]   Father, we pray, God, then for urgency.
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:27.100]   God, that our hearts would break
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.100]   and that we would fear for those
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:34.100]   who have yet to receive reconciliation and peace with you.
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:38.100]   God, that it might cause our lives to change,
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:40.100]   that we wouldn't be following after everything else
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:42.100]   that the world is following,
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:43.100]   that we wouldn't waste time
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.100]   just going after just random things,
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:48.100]   but Lord, that our hearts would constantly be going after
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.100]   those who are still under your judgment.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:54.100]   We pray, God, for all of the things
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:56.100]   that we're trying to do as a church, Lord,
[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:58.100]   to remember these things.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:00.100]   God, we pray for the evangelism training
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:03.100]   and the outings that we're going out on all this month.
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:06.100]   God, as we go out to these different places,
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.100]   to UTC, to South Coast Plaza, to Newport,
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.100]   to Huntington Beach, to Orange Circle,
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:13.100]   to Irvine Spectrum, Lord,
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.100]   that as our teams are going out,
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:18.100]   as we're going out two by two, sharing the gospel,
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.100]   Lord, that you would open doors for the gospel
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:24.100]   to be both preached and for hearts to be reached.
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:27.100]   We pray, God, that we would have faith in your word,
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:31.100]   that it is so strong to change the hardest of hearts
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.100]   and that we would go out as people
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.100]   who have faith in your word.
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:39.100]   We pray, God, that there would be boldness
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:42.100]   in your children and that we would go out
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:45.100]   not in fear again, but in joy and in hope
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.100]   and in a longing for people to turn away
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:52.100]   from their sin and to receive the great grace
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:55.100]   that can come from the only God who can save.
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:58.100]   God, as we train that we would be a surrendered people
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:00.100]   who are emptied of self,
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   people who aren't just going out evangelizing
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:05.100]   as a second and side thought,
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:08.100]   but Lord, that we would be people who are done
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:10.100]   pursuing after the things of this world
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:14.100]   and that we would be wholly be used by you.
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:17.100]   God, we pray for our missionaries,
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:19.100]   for each one that's out there.
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:23.100]   We pray, God, for our summer missions team to Korea.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:26.100]   We pray, God, that even as you've called us here
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:28.100]   to reach out to the different locations
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:30.100]   that are around, to our coworkers,
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:32.100]   to our family and friends,
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:34.100]   God, that if we want to resemble your hearts,
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:37.100]   we also need to have a global desire.
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:39.100]   Father, that we want your word to reach out
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:41.100]   to the ends of the earth.
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:49.100]   I pray, Father, that we wouldn't limit
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:51.100]   your reach in us,
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:53.100]   that you would even raise up people here
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:55.100]   in this room that would desire
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:58.100]   for that gospel to be taken,
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:01.100]   that we would lay down our lives wherever and however.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.100]   And so, God, we pray for our missionaries,
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:05.100]   for our India pastors,
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:07.100]   pray for Pastor Alex and all the others.
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.100]   God, we pray, Father, that you would place in them
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:12.100]   a strong desire, Lord,
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:15.100]   not to forget what you've called them to.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:18.100]   Give them boldness and courage and strength,
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:20.100]   and in those times of darkness and need,
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:24.100]   would you help them, God, to know your peace.
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:29.100]   Father, we pray for them to be able to see fruit,
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:33.100]   and we pray, God, more so for continued faithfulness in them.
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:36.100]   In those moments where they want to give up,
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:40.100]   in those moments where the enemy tries to lead astray,
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:43.100]   God, that you would strengthen them,
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.100]   and that you would cause them, God, to turn to you
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.100]   and cling to you again and again and again,
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:50.100]   and that they would never give up.
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:54.100]   Father, we pray for more workers in this harvest.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:56.100]   God, we look out at a world,
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:00.100]   and we pray, God, that you would strengthen them.
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:04.100]   God, sometimes we want to give up,
[01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:08.100]   but Father, we again place our faith in you
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:10.100]   and raise us up, God,
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:15.100]   to not look out with natural eyes but with spiritual ones.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:21.100]   Father, that you would cause us to share the gospel,
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:25.100]   and you would cause this church to be your hands and feet,
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.100]   and you would make this church,
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.100]   and God, your church universal,
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:32.100]   that in a time when the world seems so dark,
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:36.100]   raise up more and more workers in this harvest.
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:39.100]   Father, that we would lay down our careers,
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:41.100]   our dreams and our aspirations,
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:47.100]   our hopes, our desires, fully and wholly towards you.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:50.100]   And God, until the day we can see you again,
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:53.100]   Lord, that you would keep us faithful.
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:56.100]   Amen, God. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:16.100]   Father, we draw before you,
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:21.100]   asking you to protect this church,
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:26.100]   that you would use this church.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:31.100]   Lord, we know that you love us,
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:37.100]   and you called us to worship in spirit and in truth.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:41.100]   And as our numbers grow,
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:48.100]   Father, there is great temptation just to perform,
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:55.100]   to be efficient, to be professional.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:47:01.100]   And there's a lot of pressure to do things the way
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.100]   in which our instinct and our gifts
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:08.100]   and our abilities would dictate.
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:14.100]   But Lord, would you remind us again and again and again
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:18.100]   that apart from you we can do nothing?
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:25.100]   So would you guard and protect this pulpit, first and foremost,
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:29.100]   that every man that stands here,
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:31.100]   proclaiming, "Thus saith the Lord,"
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:35.100]   that you would help every man that comes to this pulpit
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:38.100]   to be a man of integrity,
[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:43.100]   a man who has saturated the words on the page
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:49.100]   with many tears and with much prayer and much supplication,
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:53.100]   that the desire would not be to manipulate
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:59.100]   or to tickle any ears, but to feed the sheep.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.100]   And especially, Lord God, for Pastor Peter,
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:07.100]   as his shoulders become heavier and heavier,
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:10.100]   I pray for much grace,
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:13.100]   that you would give him health,
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:16.100]   that you would give him zeal,
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:19.100]   and that you would give him an even greater love
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:22.100]   for the sheep that are in this fold,
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:27.100]   that when he prepares each week,
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:32.100]   Lord, that they would be your words that he proclaims.
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:34.100]   And Lord, I pray also for the praise team
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:38.100]   that prepares week in and week out.
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:43.100]   And there is great pressure
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:46.100]   to be more musical than ministerial.
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:49.100]   So I pray, Father God, that every member on the team,
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:55.100]   whether they're singing or they're playing an instrument,
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:58.100]   Lord, they would not be up here performing,
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:03.100]   but they would first have a posture of humility
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:06.100]   and a posture of worship.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:10.100]   And I pray especially for those who are gifted in music,
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:14.100]   that you would cause them to be trembling and fearful,
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:18.100]   knowing that they are being used to draw people
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:22.100]   into the throne of grace, into your presence.
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:25.100]   And I pray that every Sunday, Lord God,
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.100]   that you would protect this service
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.100]   so that it would not be lip service that is offered.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:32.100]   It would not just be formality that is presented,
[01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:34.100]   but it really would be worship that is done
[01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:36.100]   in spirit and in truth.
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:39.100]   And I pray also, Lord God, for all the children
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:45.100]   that are coming through our doors into our churches.
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:49.100]   Father, they are all growing up in prosperity and comfort,
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:52.100]   in good homes.
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:56.100]   There is no desperation for a savior.
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:00.100]   But Lord, we know that in due time,
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:03.100]   the world is going to have great appeal.
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:06.100]   So we pray for our next generation of children
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:09.100]   that you would raise up an army of mighty men and women
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:11.100]   who know your word, who love your word,
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:16.100]   who practice your word, who proclaim it,
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:22.100]   and who have a great zeal for your renown.
[01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:25.100]   So I pray, Lord, as all the Sunday school teachers,
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:28.100]   they're busy, they're running around,
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:31.100]   tending to needs.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.100]   May they never burn out.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:36.100]   May you remind each and every one that it is not by might,
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:39.100]   not by power, but by your spirit.
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.100]   And I pray, Father God, that you would make us
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:44.100]   a prayerful people.
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:52.100]   And I humbly and fearfully ask
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:56.100]   for brokenness,
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:51:02.100]   that you would cause our teachers to break,
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:06.100]   that the sanctifying work of the spirit would be evident
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:11.100]   in every teacher that is here.
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:13.100]   Lord, this is your church.
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:16.100]   You love it.
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:18.100]   And we pray as we are undershepherds
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:24.100]   and as we are stewards of this family here at the church,
[01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:28.100]   may we minister on your behalf,
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:32.100]   in your stead, faithfully.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:35.100]   And we pray, Lord God, that you would bear fruit
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:44.100]   in a way that honors, magnifies, and exalts Christ.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:48.100]   Father, may your renown be the very heartbeat
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:51.100]   of the ministry here at the church.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:57.100]   And I pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:00.100]   And I'll close this up in prayer.
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:03.100]   Lord, as you told us to pray for those who are in authority
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.100]   that we may live peaceful and quiet lives,
[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:09.100]   Lord, in the past years,
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:12.100]   we have seen, Lord, persecution and hatred
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:16.100]   toward your name, Lord, increase.
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:21.100]   And wickedness increase beyond imagination.
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:26.100]   Lord, we have seen the church's love for you grow cold.
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:31.100]   More concern, Lord God, of how the world would view us than you.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:33.100]   Lord, we pray for President Biden.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:36.100]   If there is any knowledge of you,
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:40.100]   help him to know that you are real,
[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:43.100]   that he is accountable for what he does,
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.100]   the decisions that he makes.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:51.100]   I pray that the fear of your name would grip his heart,
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:57.100]   that he may make decisions, policies, Lord God,
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:01.100]   that would honor you,
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:05.100]   that we may truly be able to live peaceful and quiet lives
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:09.100]   in a free country, Lord, that you have blessed for so many years,
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:13.100]   that we may gather together in worship to proclaim the truth,
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.100]   Lord God, for the gospel,
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:20.100]   that we would not live, Lord, in fear of the government's tyranny.
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:25.100]   And so we pray, Father God, for wisdom and authority, Lord God,
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:29.100]   that is above him, that he would recognize that.
[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:33.100]   We pray, Father, for Governor Newsom, Lord God,
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:38.100]   as a perversion, Lord, of sexuality
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:40.100]   that this state represents.
[01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:44.100]   I pray, Father God, the power of the gospel,
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:48.100]   that he also proclaims to know,
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:51.100]   we grip his heart, let him know, Lord God,
[01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:56.100]   that he will be accountable for the decisions that he makes.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:59.100]   I pray, Father God, that as Christians,
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:05.100]   that we would not, Lord, live in despair,
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:09.100]   knowing, Father God, that you are sovereign,
[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:12.100]   Lord, that you are Lord,
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:17.100]   that you cannot, that we cannot be touched beyond what you allow.
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.100]   Help us to live in confidence, Lord God,
[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:22.100]   to knowing, Father, that you are sovereign, you are Lord.
[01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:27.100]   And so we pray, Father God, that you would show yourself mighty.
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:31.100]   We pray for the churches, Lord, that they would be,
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:37.100]   Lord, as they proclaim, to honor you, to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:44.100]   Bring true revival, true repentance, true holiness,
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:50.100]   true proclamation of the gospel, and true worship.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:53.100]   Lord, as we end this prayer meeting,
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:58.100]   I know that so much has been lifted to you.
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:02.100]   Lord, we have brothers and sisters in this room
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:06.100]   who have ailing parents.
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:11.100]   Lord, as they cried out to you in desperation,
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:15.100]   would you be their comforter?
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:19.100]   Would you draw near to them?
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:27.100]   Lord, we have children in our congregation who do not know you.
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:30.100]   You know, Father God, that the pain that they're in,
[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:33.100]   wanting so desperately more than anything in this world,
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:36.100]   to see their children come to Christ.
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:42.100]   As they cried out to you, would you please answer their prayers?
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:46.100]   Give us the joy of bringing them to Christ.
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:51.100]   Give us the joy of baptizing them,
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:55.100]   that we may run this race together with them.
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:56:02.100]   Lord, I pray for those who are struggling with sin
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:07.100]   and the destruction that these sins have brought into their lives.
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:12.100]   Deliver them as only you can deliver them,
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:16.100]   that there would be true purity.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:22.100]   That if they covet anything else, if they're tempted by anything else,
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:27.100]   that your power would be enough for them.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:30.100]   Lord, we lifted up so many needs.
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:34.100]   Before we seek human counsel,
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:37.100]   better thinking, better wisdom, better community,
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:41.100]   help us, Lord God, to be men and women,
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:44.100]   to recognize we're desperate,
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.100]   to humble ourselves,
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:50.100]   and to seek your face,
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:53.100]   to turn from our wicked ways,
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:55.100]   to be devoted, Lord God,
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:59.100]   to make this place a household of prayer.
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:01.100]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:04.100]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:11.100]   [music]
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:18.100]   Splendor of the King,
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:23.100]   Clothed in majesty,
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:27.100]   Let all the earth rejoice,
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:31.100]   All the earth rejoice,
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:39.100]   He wraps himself in light,
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:44.100]   And darkness tries to hide,
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:48.100]   And trembles at His voice,
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:52.100]   And trembles at His voice,
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:58.100]   How great is our God,
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:05.100]   Sing with me, how great is our God,
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:09.100]   And all will say, how great,
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:20.100]   How great is our God,
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:27.100]   And age to age He stands,
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:32.100]   And time is in His hands,
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:35.100]   Beginning and the end,
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:40.100]   Beginning and the end,
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:47.100]   The God of three in one,
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:52.100]   Father, Spirit, Son,
[01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:55.100]   The Lion and the Lamb,
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:58.100]   The Lion and the Lamb,
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:00.100]   How great is our God,
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:05.100]   How great is our God,
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:12.100]   Sing with me, how great is our God,
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:17.100]   And all will say, how great,
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:24.100]   How great is our God,
[01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:27.100]   Name above all names,
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:34.100]   Name above all names,
[01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:40.100]   Worthy of all praise,
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:43.100]   And my heart will sing,
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:49.100]   How great is our God,
[01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:54.100]   One more time, name above.
[01:59:54.100 --> 02:00:00.100]   Name above all names,
[02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:06.100]   You are worthy of all praise,
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:10.100]   And my heart will sing,
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:19.100]   How great is our God,
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:25.100]   How great is our God,
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:32.100]   Sing with me, how great is our God,
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:37.100]   And all will say, how great,
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:44.100]   How great is our God.
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:49.100]   All right, thank you.
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:51.100]   We'll see you guys Sunday.
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:59.100]   If some of you guys can stick around
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:01.100]   and help us to put the chairs back,
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:02.100]   okay?
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:04.100]   And if you need to go,
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:07.100]   if we can ask you guys to go to the cafe area,
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:08.100]   'cause we'll need the space
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:10.100]   to be able to put things back.
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:12.100]   Okay?
