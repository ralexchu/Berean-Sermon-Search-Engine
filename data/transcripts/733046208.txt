[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   - Hello, my name is Maggie and I am 13 years old.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.600]   I will be in ninth grade this fall.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.520]   Some of you may know my family because we've been going to this church for 10 years since
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.040]   I was three.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.280]   It's rare for there to be a kid like me sharing my testimony, but it is truly by the grace
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.880]   of God that I am following him at such a young age.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.480]   It is such a blessing and I would be lost without him.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.240]   As I mentioned, my family has been going to this church since I was three.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.920]   I am so grateful to have parents who love the Lord and have faithfully taught me about
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.680]   the gospel.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.920]   I always believed the gospel truth because it was all like I had ever really been taught.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.200]   I thought of myself as a pretty good kid and thought that I was going to heaven when I
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.360]   died because I affirmed gospel truths, went to church and read my Bible.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.520]   But my heart was in rebellion against God.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.160]   I didn't love him and was just doing outwardly religious things for the approval of people.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.800]   I lived with this false assurance for most of my childhood.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.600]   It wasn't until 2020, about two years ago, that things started to change.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.800]   God used the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit in March that year, to reveal my sin and the
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.040]   state of my heart to me.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.600]   In the main sense of my life were anger, bitterness and apathy.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.860]   These things manifested themselves in many ways.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.920]   I yelled at my siblings all the time for virtually no reason.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.520]   I was really disrespectful to my parents, slacking off in schoolwork and chores because
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.560]   they didn't matter to me.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.480]   And I stopped reading my Bible and paying attention to online sermons because they were
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.360]   of no interest to me.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.600]   I didn't love God and it began to show itself outwardly.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.800]   I noticed my sin and began to doubt, could a true Christian behave like this?
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.560]   At first, I distracted myself from my doubt and just dismissed it.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.000]   But over time, I came to an absolute certainty that I could not be a Christian.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.940]   This made me sad and fearful, but I tried to distract myself from that as well.
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.600]   I sought satisfaction from the things of the world, thinking that my fear wouldn't matter
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.720]   if all my hopes and dreams came true.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.760]   But my sin continued to get worse and worse, not only outwardly, but at the heart level
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.960]   as well.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.560]   I can confidently say that during that time, I hated God.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   As I saw the ugliness of my heart, I grew more and more desperate, but my pride kept
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   getting in the way.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.240]   I thought that my way was better than God's way.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.800]   I thought that I was strong enough to fix my sin by myself.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.240]   I thought that I didn't need Jesus, but the more I tried to be self-sufficient, the worse
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.560]   it got.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.160]   I was heading down a spiral to destruction.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.200]   I knew this deep down inside, but I didn't want to admit it.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.280]   Again, I was too prideful.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.920]   That fall, I was 12 and entering the youth group.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.160]   I went to youth group mainly because I wanted to make friends and also because my parents
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.800]   wanted me to.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.160]   I sought satisfaction through friendships, but despite this wrong motive, God used the
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.760]   teaching in youth group those first few months of seventh grade to soften my heart and show
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.520]   me that all my strivings were futile and that all my attempts at good works were useless.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.280]   I realized that I needed Jesus and that I couldn't rely on myself.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.320]   I had always been taught this as a kid, but it wasn't until this time that I really, truly
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.280]   understood in my heart what it meant.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.200]   I was brought to a point of total desperation one night that fall.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.600]   I had a lot of time to think about things and I thought, "I'm a terrible person," because
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   that's the truth.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.960]   No matter how hard I tried, my heart was ugly and full of sin.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.080]   In that moment, I realized the staggering truth that someone had already been punished
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.660]   for my sins, but it wasn't me who had been punished.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.660]   It was Jesus.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.520]   He took the debt of my sin upon himself.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.240]   He bore the wrath that I deserved, and his resurrection is proof of the fact that he
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.480]   had the power to pay for my sins.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.440]   For the first time in a while, I prayed.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.160]   I told God that I needed him and that I couldn't change the state of my heart on my own.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   I cried out to him for help.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.040]   He heard me and caused me to be born again that night.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.920]   I turned away from my life of sin and turned to Christ, surrendering my whole life over
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.960]   to him as my Lord and Savior.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.480]   I saw in that moment the overwhelming and incomprehensible love with which he loved
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.600]   me.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.520]   There was no reason that he should love a sinner like me, but he did.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.040]   I couldn't understand why, but I was so grateful for what Christ had done for me on the cross.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.240]   After that point, I began to change.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.600]   I began to read the word, seeking to know this God who had saved me.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.840]   As I read, it wasn't just Bible knowledge, but it took root in my heart and caused me
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.880]   to love the Lord even more.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.480]   The Holy Spirit empowered me to love those around me, regardless of whether or not they
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   loved me.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.600]   It was very hard, but I began the process of uprooting the anger and bitterness in my
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.280]   heart.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.580]   I also met up with my youth group teacher, and God used and still uses her wise guidance
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.240]   and counsel to mold and shape me in the likeness of Christ.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.480]   To this day, I am still far from perfect.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.200]   There are still many areas in which I need to grow.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.040]   But the Lord has brought me through so much, and I know that no matter what happens in
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.400]   my life, he is sovereign and good.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.640]   No matter how many times I hear it, the gospel can never grow old.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.440]   It is the foundation of my life, my identity, my hope, and my joy.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.160]   I look forward to the time when I can meet my Savior face to face, and I know that he
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.680]   will bring me safely there.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   Thank you.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   [applause]
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   [inaudible]
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:43.680]   [applause]
