[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hello everyone, my name is Jared Kwong.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.040]   I am a fourth year biology major at UCI
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.280]   and I will be sharing my testimony with you today.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.520]   My testimony is a little different
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.780]   in that I did not have a specific date
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.100]   where I came to know Christ,
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.180]   but more of a gradual coming to know him.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.020]   I was raised in a Christian family for most of my life.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.560]   I went to church.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.780]   Before coming to know Christ,
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.360]   I selfishly desired Christ as a means to get to heaven.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.920]   I was introduced to the gospel at a very young age
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560]   where I was told that I was a sinner
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.240]   and if I believed in Jesus, I could go to heaven.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.920]   Out of fear of being punished, I put my faith in Christ,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.600]   but not actually understanding the weight of my sin
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.400]   and who Christ really was.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.400]   With this very shallow understanding of the gospel,
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.880]   I grew up thinking I was a Christian.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.300]   I would remember all the rules and commandments
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.280]   I learned in Sunday school
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.380]   and follow them as best as possible.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.320]   Anyone who didn't follow them,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.640]   I looked down upon and saw as inferior.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520]   Throughout high school, I began to indulge
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.120]   in an assortment of sins such as lust, pride,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.800]   and selfishness.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.960]   At the time though, I did not think I was indulging
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.480]   in these sins, but just struggling.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.300]   I saw these sins as bad, but nothing more than that.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.680]   I knew I needed to stop sinning,
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760]   but because I did not know the true implications of my sin,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.560]   I did not.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.860]   I would be challenged in my faith that I had in God
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.540]   through my home church's youth group.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.440]   I began to doubt my salvation and began to seek counsel
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.520]   from an elder from my home church.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.060]   After many meetups, it became evident to me
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.320]   that I wasn't saved.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.440]   I again placed my faith in Christ and would be baptized,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.880]   but again with a shallow understanding of the gospel
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.440]   and only seeing Christ as a means to get to heaven.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.160]   In a span of a year and a half,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.220]   God would work in my heart to break down the gospel
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.800]   I created in my head and would work in my heart
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.760]   to see his true gospel.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.360]   He would do this through books, meetups, and sermons.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.400]   In the book, The Holiness of God,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.720]   was the first time I understood God's holiness
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.060]   in that he is set apart from me.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.680]   Then through the gospel according to Jesus,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.240]   God revealed to me that Christ was not just Savior,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.000]   but also Lord over my life.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.480]   Then in a sermon from Pastor Peter that broke down
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.120]   my view of the gospel was when he mentioned
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.740]   that the gospel is not just a safety net
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.020]   or some free ticket out of hell.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.800]   Finally, through a meetup with Pastor Nate,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.660]   God made me see that I saw my sin as bad,
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.540]   but not sorrowful over my sin.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.920]   This was the final piece that made me realize
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.800]   how far I was from God and that I truly did not know him.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   After realizing this, I began to pray to God
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.640]   to reveal to me my sin and to understand
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.100]   the magnitude of my sin.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.560]   After some time, God revealed to me how great my sin
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.460]   is toward him through Isaiah 6, three to five,
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.980]   which states, "And one called out to one another
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.880]   "and said, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.500]   "'The whole earth is full of his glory.'
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.760]   "And the foundations of the thresholds trembled
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.580]   "at the voice of him who called out
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.660]   "while the temple was filling with smoke.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.400]   "Then I said, 'Woe is me, for I am ruined,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.260]   "'because I am a man of unclean lips
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.020]   "'and live among a people of unclean lips,
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.320]   "'for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.'"
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.620]   From this verse, God revealed to me my need for Christ
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.560]   in order to be forgiven because of my sins.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.320]   After recognizing this, I asked for forgiveness for Christ,
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.600]   I asked for forgiveness for Christ to be Lord
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.180]   and Savior over my life and to no longer live
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.980]   for myself but for Christ.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.480]   Although I may not be perfect, I see God sanctifying me
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.360]   after coming to know him.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.120]   One of the big differences in my desires
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.600]   is that I want others to know him and to be saved.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.440]   I see how broken I am but also see the grace of God
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.120]   that has saved me and I want others to know Christ
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.220]   and have a personal relationship with him.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.240]   As I reflect on the past, I see God's sovereign work
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   being done in my life and how he has been so gracious
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.800]   and merciful to me no matter how much I sinned.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.020]   This is something I'm always going to be grateful for.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.860]   Thank you.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.020]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:29.780]   the water you're driving prices that we brought
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.640]   for the United.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.800]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.040]   (man speaking faintly)
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.000]   (audience applauding)
