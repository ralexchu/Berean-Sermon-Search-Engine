[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   We're gonna go ahead and get started with our service this evening.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   With this first song, Here I Am to Worship.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Light of the world.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Light of the world, you step down into darkness.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Open my eyes, let me see.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Beauty that made this heart adore you.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Hope of a life spent with you.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Here I am to worship.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Here I am to bow down.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Here I am to say that you're my God.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Altogether wonderful to me.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   King of all days.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   King of all days, oh, so highly exalted.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Glorious in heaven above.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Humbly you came to the earth you created.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   All for love's sake became poor.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   So here I am to worship.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Here I am to bow down.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Here I am to say that you're my God.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Altogether wonderful to me.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And I'll never know how much it costs
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   to see my sin upon that cross.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And I'll never know how much it costs
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   to see my sin upon that cross.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So here I am to worship.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Here I am to bow down.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Here I am to say that you're my God.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Altogether wonderful to me.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Altogether wonderful to me.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Amen.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   I'm glad you guys can all make it.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   These moments together during this week
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   are important times for us to remember and appreciate
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   all that has happened.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   What we want to do in each of these devotion nights
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   is to walk through the events of history
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and also to think of the many perspectives that are there
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   but also the experiences that our Savior went through.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And so we'll be doing that.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   We'll also be hearing testimony, salvation testimonies,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   from some of our members of the church.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And tonight we have our brother Josh Malapudi
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   who's going to come up after the worship set
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   to share his testimony with us.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   So as we prepare our hearts, would you please bow your hands
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   and let's begin with a word of prayer.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Our God, we want to thank you so much.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And Lord, we want to continue just to appreciate in our lives
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   all that you have done and all that you are to us.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And God, as we think about Jesus our Savior,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   we want to continue to reflect and to think deeply
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   about all the steps he took.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   We recognize, Father God, that there are so many elements
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   of his suffering, the magnitude of the cross, Lord,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   we will never comprehend.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   But even leading up to it, we recognize that our Lord
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   truly set his face like Flint and that he was dedicated
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   to come to suffer and to sacrifice his life for us.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And so, God, we worship you, we thank you,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and we pray, Father God, that as we reflect
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and that God, as we join together in worship,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   we would raise essentially our gratitude
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   and hearts of praise to you.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And, Father, may our hearts be filled that more and more
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   truly we would recognize your glory
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   and that our affection would rise to you, Lord.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   We thank you for this time.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Why don't we all stand for a time of praise?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   [music]
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   One church.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   One church, one faith, one anthem raised.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   God and God alone.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   One cross, one grace, one name that saves.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   All praise to you belongs.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   All praise to you belongs.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   We lift you higher, higher.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   God and God alone.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Your name be louder, louder than any other song.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   You are forever God and God alone.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Who else?
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Who else can wash our sin away?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   God and God alone.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Who else can raise us from the grave?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   All praise to you belongs.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Jesus, all praise to you belongs.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   We lift you higher, higher.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   God and God alone.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Your name be louder, louder than any other song.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   You are forever God and God alone.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And what can separate us from this amazing love?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   What can say it's greater than our God?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Every knee will bow down.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And what can separate us from this amazing love?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   What can say it's greater than our God?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Every knee will bow down.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Oh, every knee will bow down.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   We lift you higher, higher.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   God and God alone.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Your name be louder, louder than any other song.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   We lift you higher, higher.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   God and God alone.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Your name be louder, louder than any other song.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   You are forever God and God alone.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   You are forever God and God alone.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   You became nothing, poured out to death.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Many times I've wondered at your gift of life.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And I'm in that place once again.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   I'm in that place once again.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Once again.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Once again I look upon the cross where you died.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Once again I thank you.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Once again I pour out my life.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Now you are.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Now you are.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Exalted to the highest place.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   King of the heavens.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   No one day I'll bow.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But for now I marvel at this saving grace.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I'm full of praise once again.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I'm full of praise once again.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Once again I look upon the cross where you died.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Once again I thank you.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Once again I pour out my life.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Thank you for the cross.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Thank you for the cross.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Thank you for the cross.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Thank you for the cross.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Thank you for the cross.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Once again I look upon the cross where you died.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Once again I thank you.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Once again I pour out my life.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Once again.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Once again I look upon the cross where you died.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Once again I thank you.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Once again I pour out my life.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Thank you for the cross.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Thank you for the cross.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.860]   Pastor Mark a few weeks ago asked me to share my testimony.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:43.240]   And thinking about it, I wanted to, I started wondering like why am I saved and kind of
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.500]   the history.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:50.880]   And so I started searching and I found a whole bunch of old books from written in the 1800s
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:57.400]   and 1900s of how missionaries came to my part of India, where my parents are from.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:06.080]   And it's been an interesting journey the past two weeks reading letters and correspondence
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   about their experiences.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:14.920]   And it just blown me away how they struggled in every aspect, didn't have money, didn't
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.920]   know the language.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:24.120]   And the two missionaries that came to my area specifically, they went six years preaching
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.840]   the gospel without anyone converting, which just blew my mind.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:35.980]   How can two people leaving their country of England sailing and struggling for six years
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:44.160]   without any fruit and yet they persisted until my great, great, great grandfather heard the
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.620]   message and accepted Jesus.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:52.900]   And so I stand on the shoulders of a lot of sacrifice.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.960]   And it was a very humbling experience to just to read that.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:05.640]   And so for me, I grew up in a Christian family where being in India, if you're a Christian,
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:12.760]   you have to kind of be willing to be ostracized by society.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:18.200]   And so it was just something I was born into.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.100]   Both my grandparents, my mom and dad side, they planted lots of churches, very active
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.100]   in the ministry.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.280]   And so this was my life as a little kid.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.100]   And coming here to the US, it was the same.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.900]   We just grew up, I grew up in the church.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.680]   And so it was all I knew.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.280]   Everything like not missing a Sunday, being active in Sunday school, the whole deal.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.740]   The church I grew up in sixth grade, they have tradition of giving new Bibles once you're
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.040]   done with sixth grade.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:56.180]   And I remember receiving a brand new NIV Bible.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:02.480]   And I challenged myself, I wanted to read the whole Bible within a year.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:09.440]   And so I remember I started reading, I toughed it through the genealogies.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.960]   And by the time I got to the story of David, I was hooked.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.040]   It was very exciting to hear just David's conquest.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.000]   I related to him because in school I was always picked last.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.040]   And so here's David being the smallest of his brothers.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.320]   And so I just, it was great.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.560]   I was excited because it went from boring to exciting, just reading the Bible.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:44.960]   Then I came to the history of David, where the part where he commits adultery with Bathsheba.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.760]   I remember reading it as a seventh grader confused why David, who experienced the power
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.320]   of God in such a tangible way, could do something like that.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.080]   And not only that, he went to murder Uriah.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:04.200]   And I clearly remember reading the part where Nathan confronts David about his sin and tells
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.160]   him the story of the neighbor and the lamb.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.720]   And I remember crying over that story.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.240]   Although this, and it was at this point, I stopped reading.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.480]   I remember I stopped reading, I couldn't continue.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.960]   But this didn't shake my faith.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.760]   It just left me with a lot of questions.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.040]   The next major challenge to my faith came in college as a biology major.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:30.400]   My professors started, regardless of whatever the course was, whether it was relevant to
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.680]   evolutionary process or not, that's what they would start with.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.360]   And they would tell me to put my faith aside and my beliefs aside.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:45.160]   And so again, this started putting doubts and questions in my mind.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.640]   And it was not my search for answers.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:54.680]   I ran into a talk given by Dr. Hugh Ross, an astrophysicist, who explained how the biblical
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.320]   account isn't contradicted by science, but rather supported by it.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.760]   And in one of his talks, he talks about how the moment of Jesus' death on the cross, even
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:09.360]   though it occurred at a specific time in history, the payment was applied throughout all time,
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.700]   both past and future.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.920]   So it was this point, like, it really clicked.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:20.720]   Like when David sinned, and Nathan at the end says, "God has put your sin," it was just
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.080]   one little statement where it says, "The Lord has allowed your sin to pass," which is, I
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:32.800]   mean, that one statement covering all the craziness that David did, it's only made sense
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.600]   by what Christ did on the cross.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.640]   And so in all my questions regarding evolution, it was through talks, listening, and researching
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.000]   by Dr. James Tour and Stephen Meyer.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.640]   And it was just like all those questions I had, it was answered.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:59.560]   And this was over a course of years that my questions were answered, and to a point where
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:07.840]   I was pretty confident, and yet my faith was just, it wasn't, it was, I didn't have the
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.920]   sorrow for sin.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.360]   I felt like I had the formula to get into heaven.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.720]   I knew that if I lived a good life, I did A, B, and C, and I was looking for a better
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   life.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:25.360]   But one day I was listening to a sermon by John MacArthur, and he was talking about Matthew
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.360]   7.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.440]   I always thought Matthew 7, with the narrow and the wide road, I thought, "Okay, the narrow
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:36.640]   is for people that are believers, and the wide is non-believers, Hindus, Muslims, whatever."
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.920]   But he wanted to explain that, no, actually, they're all filled with people that think
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.120]   they're going to heaven, that believe in Jesus.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:51.840]   And it was that sermon that really just opened my eyes.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:59.080]   And the cross-references for striving to enter the kingdom, it was nothing that I ever really
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   heard in church before.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:06.160]   Even though I thought I was a Christian, I went to church regularly, my prayer life was
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.680]   poor, I didn't really read the Bible that regularly, but it was that sermon that really
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.320]   just set me on a different path.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.600]   In Luke 13, 24, Jesus says, "Strive to enter the narrow door.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.800]   For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and not be able to."
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:29.080]   And the word for strive was a word, agonizome, and the cross-references going back to Jacob
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.680]   struggling with God, and in Matthew, how the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.040]   violent take it by force.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.720]   So it shattered whatever my thinking was.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:48.640]   And it was that time that I started to question myself, am I striving?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:54.200]   And then going back to understanding the pain and suffering that Jesus took on the cross,
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.960]   and I realized it was just a big magnifying glass on my own life, things that I haven't
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   done.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:06.720]   And I feared that growing up in the church, I became somewhat desensitized to God's word.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.320]   I had zeal, but not according to knowledge.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.920]   God has been so patient with me.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:17.000]   He has addressed all the doubts I've had, and the realization that while, even while
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.920]   I was living in sin, Christ still chose to love me and died for me.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.720]   It just came to me with a new clarity.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.960]   I'm still learning, and through more careful reading of the Bible, which is ongoing, God
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.960]   has been slowly correcting my understanding, resulting in a true relationship with him.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.960]   Thank you.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:32.960]   [applause]
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:45.000]   >> Okay, thank you, Josh.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.680]   So at this time, I'm going to be walking through the events of that Passion Week on Monday,
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:58.200]   and I want to begin by just going right into thinking through the events that's happened.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:07.160]   When we think about that week, I want to show you a little quick picture of how the disciples
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:13.200]   in Christ would station themselves over in Bethany, and then walk into Jerusalem, repeatedly
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.480]   going back and forth doing the various ministries.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.480]   So just really briefly, on Saturday night, they would go over to Bethany, which on the
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:27.340]   pictures on your guys' right, and it's about almost two miles away, where they would have
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:32.800]   to traverse and walk through the Mount Olives, and then they would pass by the Garden of
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.400]   Gethsemane, and then into the temple, okay?
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.840]   And I want to show you that because on Saturday they were there, Sunday they came in, in what
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.240]   is called a triumphal entry.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.120]   We learned about it this past Sunday.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.960]   And then, in the evening, they returned back to Bethany, and on Monday, they're essentially
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.440]   walking back towards Jerusalem.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.720]   And what we have is an interesting story.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.400]   There's a two-part today.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.560]   One, Jesus' interaction with this tree, and then Jesus entering into the temple, and then
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.000]   clearing it.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.680]   So to begin first, there is this interaction that is kind of strange, and kind of odd when
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.220]   you first take a look.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:15.120]   And it's Jesus taking a look at a fig tree on the way to Jerusalem, and then cursing
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.280]   it, okay?
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.320]   Let's take a moment to read the passage.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's in Mark chapter 11, verse 12 through 14, okay?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Mark 11, verse 12 through 14.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.840]   And the passage reads this way.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.320]   On the next day, when they had left Bethany, he became hungry.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.120]   Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if perhaps he would find anything
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.120]   on it.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.940]   And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:49.000]   He said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again."
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.280]   And his disciples were listening, okay?
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.760]   Now there is a little bit of confusion sometimes pertaining to this interaction with the fig
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:03.380]   tree, because tomorrow morning, after they've gone home to Bethany for the evening, on their
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.680]   way back, they interact with it again, and Jesus uses it as a teaching tool.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.080]   But here, what we have is Jesus first taking a look at the tree.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   There's a lot of leaves on it.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.360]   It's in full bloom, so to speak, but there's no fruit.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.560]   And so when you think about this, it seems okay.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.480]   It's just a natural progression of Jesus walking early in the morning, and just like you wake
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.820]   up super hungry, maybe he felt the same.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.560]   But I want you to take a moment to think about how strange this would be.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.680]   Number one, that in the Passion Week story, this is a part of the narrative, right?
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.620]   It almost seems kind of comedic.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:43.680]   But two, how strange it must have been for the disciples to see their Lord, to see their
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.440]   Master, walking towards this tree and going, "Bah!
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.880]   No fruit!"
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.440]   And then he gets really harsh, really fast, and it amps up.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.160]   And you might even wonder, from the disciples' perspective, looking at Jesus' words, maybe
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.240]   they're thinking, "Guys, let's not mess with him today.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.800]   He's like hangry, like really bad, angry from his hungers," or something like that.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.520]   Like, "Whoa, did Jesus Christ just wake up on the wrong side of the bed?
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.680]   Was it a full week of just nonstop, and so he's fatigued and tired?
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.480]   Why so harsh?"
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:27.120]   And as a matter of fact, if you'd imagine, if you saw someone talk that way, you would
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.160]   almost wonder, like, "Are you being childish?"
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   Right?
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.120]   "Don't worry.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.800]   If you're that upset, I'll find you something."
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.320]   I wonder if perhaps those were the thoughts that perhaps would go through the mind.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:47.440]   But as you guys know, when we think of Jesus' reaction, this is a significant moment because
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.600]   it has much to say about what Jesus is seeing, and how Jesus, but also the rest of Scripture,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.360]   in many significant moments, have used the example of the fig tree to talk about the
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.720]   state of mankind.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.640]   Now when we think about fig trees, I'm not going to go deep into it.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.040]   Just real quick, I went on a long, long rabbit trail researching about fig trees preparing
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.440]   for this message, and there is this crazy thing about fig trees and wasps.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.440]   Okay?
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.000]   I'm not going to tell you about it, but it's crazy.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Look into it.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.120]   It's a little gross, but what I'm going to say is that the fig trees have such a unique
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:32.160]   relationship with wasps that they will be internally pollinated, and they're very, very
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.480]   resilient.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.480]   What's my point in sharing with you all this information?
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:42.200]   Is that fig trees were supposed to be resilient trees that bore its fruit in whatever kind
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.080]   of scenario and landscape.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:51.740]   Did you know that 90% of US's fig, like the little fruit, its production comes from California?
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.760]   Because it was trained essentially to give fruit all year.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.480]   Fig trees naturally have two seasons, very close to the spring and fall, where they're
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.800]   supposed to bear fruit.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:06.560]   The point here in our context is, in this narrative, is Jesus saw that it was full of
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.480]   leaves.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.120]   It faked like he was ready.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:15.640]   This fig tree looked like he was going to bear fruit.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.560]   And so upon Jesus coming and looking at it carefully, there was no fruit at all, was
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.560]   there?
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.960]   And it doesn't take much then to come to a point of quick conviction that what Jesus
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:31.800]   saw was a mass of leaves, but no fruit in it, and therefore brings us to this conviction.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:37.120]   What Jesus saw just the other day was a mass amount of people, and yet no worship.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.560]   What Jesus is going to see regularly throughout the week is massive amounts of people constantly
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.800]   following him.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.540]   They're very content to mass together.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.340]   They're very content to come and gather, but there was no prayer.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:57.680]   They're very content to come and perhaps do the ritual, but there was no intent and purpose
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.760]   to receive what was supposed to be the purpose of the ritual.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.200]   Why were they gathering together?
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.040]   Why was there such a significant buildup to the Passover, where everybody had to go through
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.760]   all these conveniences of gathering together?
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.520]   And you guys have heard that there was easily about a million people perhaps within one
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:24.760]   city at that time for this important, significant moment that God had instituted.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.480]   Why were they there?
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:34.440]   Now the thing about it is, Jesus' reaction to this scenario then is he is upset.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.880]   And I'm not sure if it bothers you, I mean, this question, does it bother you whenever
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.000]   you see Jesus upset in the scripture?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.480]   I think that subconsciously I've been duped by too many images of Jesus where he's supposed
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:55.560]   to be like a floating, stoic, like sage-like being, where he doesn't react in any way.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.560]   But clearly he does.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.200]   And what's more, my own reaction informs me that I forget Jesus has said, "The master
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.120]   of the field expects fruit to be born."
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.400]   And when the master of the field sees that the trees are not bearing fruit, he actually
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.080]   says then that tree is only good for fire.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.480]   And it's not going to be left alone to take up space in the field.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.440]   God expected fruit to be born.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.600]   Christ is looking at this tree and he's disappointed.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:32.480]   Here's a passage that Christ describing a parable, he says this, and I'm going to read
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.320]   for you from Luke chapter 13.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.840]   What has happened is there is a story that individuals tragically died because a building
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.160]   fell down on them.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.720]   And what Jesus says is in verse 5, "I tell you, no, unless you repent, you will all likewise
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   perish."
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.240]   Meaning there has to be the fruit of faith.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.280]   Verse 6, "And he began telling this parable, a man had a fig tree which had been planted
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.920]   in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it and he did not find any.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.920]   And he said to the vineyard keeper, 'Behold, for three years I've come looking for fruit
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.520]   on this fig tree without finding any.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.520]   Cut it down.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.180]   Why does it even use up the ground?'"
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.560]   So coming back to this question, why was Jesus so harsh with this tree?
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.720]   Well, one, trees are supposed to bear fruit.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.440]   The mass of the tree expects it.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.800]   But two, the fig tree has been used not only in this time but many significant times before
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.040]   to talk about the entirety of God's chosen nation, not bearing the kind of fruit that
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.040]   God expected.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.680]   Here's a passage from Hosea for you.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.980]   Chapter 9, verse 10, it says, "I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.700]   I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season, but they
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:50.500]   came to Baal Peor and devoted themselves to shame and they became as detestable as that
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.120]   which they loved."
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.620]   Now this is not the only passage.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:02.260]   There are so many passages from long ago with a long history of this kind of actually you
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.180]   can call it tragedy or you can call it this fruitlessness.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:12.020]   And what I'm saying is as Jesus re-enters into Jerusalem, that's exactly what Christ
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.960]   himself is seeing.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.540]   So when we think about it, he enters into the temple and what does he see?
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:22.740]   He sees again that in Jerusalem day to day there are so many people, lots of leaves,
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.980]   and yet no fruit.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.980]   Why?
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:30.780]   Because in the next scene what he sees is that the temple is full of people but no prayer.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.540]   Right?
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:38.860]   The temple is full of people doing merchandise exchange, and coin changes, and business,
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.580]   and etc., etc.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:44.300]   And what happens as you know is Jesus drives out the merchants and here I want to read
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:50.040]   to you the story continuing on in Mark chapter 11, verse 15 through 19.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.500]   So Mark 11, 15 through 19 says this, "Then they came to Jerusalem and he entered the
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:59.380]   temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple and overturned
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.940]   the tables of the money changers in the seats of those who were selling doves.
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.780]   And he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:11.740]   And he began to teach and say to them, 'Is it not written, "My house shall be called
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:17.220]   a house of prayer for all the nations, but you have met at a robber's den."
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.860]   The chief priests and the scribes heard this and began seeking how to destroy him, for
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.860]   they were afraid of him.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.080]   For the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.800]   When evening came, they would go out to the city."
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:35.700]   So very much the connection I'm trying to make for you is like a tree that on the outer
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:42.340]   appearances is in many ways I guess you could say in full bloom.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:47.620]   If you remember how Jerusalem looked, it was beautiful.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.460]   Remember how I showed you that little picture of the walk from Bethany over to Jerusalem?
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.340]   Do you recall how the disciples would walk that?
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.540]   They would stop at the Mount of Olives because they're elevated.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.540]   They'd see Jerusalem.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.700]   They would just sit there and be like, "Wow, Jerusalem is amazing.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.060]   The temple is beautiful."
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.480]   Right?
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:14.500]   But unfortunately, Jesus was looking at this scenario and saying, "This is all wrong.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:21.500]   This is not the purpose by which God has established this place, these people, why he's called
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.300]   you to gather in this fashion."
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:29.700]   And so one of the meditation questions that I want you to think about is as we're walking
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:35.300]   through the events, sometimes it's important to think like, "Whoa, if we drop ourselves
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:44.180]   down, we too perhaps could be drawn along by the hype, by the sheer size, by the visual
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.460]   glory of everything and just think everything's awesome.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.620]   The people are gathered.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.700]   Everything is just hustling and bustling.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.340]   Maybe they're even thinking like, 'Dude, there's hope for our economy.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.340]   I don't know.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.980]   I'm just postulating now."
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:00.980]   Right?
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:06.340]   But could you imagine walking into that kind of scenario and you be the one thinking, "No,
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.740]   this is all wrong.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.140]   How could it be so wrong?"
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.700]   And I want to ask you that question.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.900]   How could it go so far?
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:21.940]   How could the people lose their way so much that in the temple where they were taught
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.500]   to tremble as they enter, right?
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.120]   You think from the Jewish perspective, they were taught to be cautious.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:33.340]   They were taught to recognize that coming into the place of worship before God was an
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:39.700]   incredible privilege but also a threat to your life because of the holiness of God and
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.780]   yet it go so sour.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.080]   How could it go so wrong?
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.260]   You could only postulate that, yes, there were crooks.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.640]   There were the shady people.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:54.220]   They knew that you, if you were a Jew, had to come in, you had to take your Roman coin
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.940]   and you had to change it for a shekel, right?
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:02.840]   There was a specific kind of sanctuary-use coin for the Jews that they had to offer up
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.340]   and therefore, lucrative business.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.700]   Let me change that coin for you.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.180]   Ah, sorry, there's a little fee, right?
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.780]   There are people who are taking advantage of the situation.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.180]   Could it be that the leaders had long ago lost their way?
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:20.060]   That they were no longer people who are mediating and serving God and making sure that the voice
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:24.820]   of God was going forth but they were using their positions just to pad themselves.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:30.180]   Look how holy and set apart we are, right?
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:35.620]   Or could it be just that the people in mass, it was just nice?
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.620]   It was nice to gather.
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.780]   It was great to exchange ideas and goods.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.500]   Yes, we still have to come and do the sacrifice.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:47.900]   Yes, we have to still come for the Passover but if we're doing it, then let's make it
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:48.900]   convenient.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.900]   I don't know.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.500]   I could just only postulate.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:57.580]   But what I want us to focus on now is as we're walking through the events, think about Christ
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.220]   entering into the scene.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:04.780]   And with the same anger that he has against the tree, he directs at the people that he
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:11.220]   sees and he starts to go into this mode where he drives out the merchants.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.460]   He flips over the tables.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.560]   Why?
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.700]   Because there is zeal in his heart.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:21.660]   And there was this question in my mind like if we're walking through the events of history,
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:28.180]   how do we feel the indignation that Jesus feels?
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:34.340]   How do I come to a point where I'm like, "Oh my goodness, that is right.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.940]   This is appropriate, proper, and righteous of you to feel this."
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:45.180]   And I found it because I recall that this was not the first time.
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.680]   Do you guys remember that?
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:53.700]   Early in the scriptures, John chapter 2, right after Jesus performs his early miracle of
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:59.660]   turning water into wine, you know, Jesus was already doing ministry, right, in a sense.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.420]   Well he was doing ministry for three years.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.100]   That means Passover has come around multiple times.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.900]   Do you think the first time he saw that he was okay?
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.860]   And he thought like, "Oh well, what can you do?"
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.180]   Early on in Jesus' ministry in John chapter 2, it records a time when Jesus entered the
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:19.860]   temple during the Passover when everybody gathered and a similar scenario happened.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.660]   Let me read that passage to you.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.300]   It's John chapter 2 verse 11.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.980]   And it says, "The Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and he
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:33.980]   found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves and the moneychangers
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.260]   seated at the tables.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.860]   So he made a scourge of cords and drove them all out of the temple with the sheep and the
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.260]   oxen and he poured out the coins of the moneychangers, overturned the tables.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.020]   And to those who were selling the doves, he said, 'Take these things away.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:55.220]   Stop making my Father's house a place of business.'"
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:02.860]   Does that have then the same effect for you where you realize Jesus already were warning,
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:08.820]   clearly teaching, correcting, and telling these people, "What you do in the house of
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:12.300]   God is absolutely wrong."
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:19.840]   But that means with resiliency, with stubbornness, they refuse to bear the fruit.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.300]   And so when I asked the question earlier, "Is it strange that Jesus was so upset at
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.300]   the tree?"
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:30.900]   And is it strange to you that when Jesus enters into the temple, he is enraged?
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.140]   Because the heart of man is so stubborn.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:39.620]   You know how stubborn this is going to be, that upon repeated correction, rather than
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:44.860]   yielding that which they know because the guilt is already upon them, they're going
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.940]   to decide, "You know what we need to do is we need to get rid of this guy."
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:55.220]   And so what I want you to see is that in many ways the temple, yes, many have gathered,
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:59.260]   yes, leaves all around, the temple is Ichabod.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:05.180]   Long ago there was a scenario where this idea of Ichabod meant that although the walls of
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:09.820]   the building are there, the glory of God has already departed.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.820]   Yes?
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:16.700]   And that is the only reason why that temple could ever be destroyed because no power of
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.500]   the Spirit is in there.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.740]   And that is a sad state of affairs.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.500]   So then there is grieving, there is frustration, there is anger.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.860]   And I have a slide for you to think about Jesus' actions upon seeing these things.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:35.460]   And I want us to just think about what he's doing and how when sometimes when we read
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:43.060]   of it, we may not think how profound it is, but I want you to imagine you seeing an individual
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.980]   potentially even like this.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.620]   We're all gathered.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:51.140]   There is a sense that, hey, something solemn and great is going to happen here, but he
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:56.340]   makes an incredible scene where Jesus drives out merchants.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:59.340]   He literally tells them, "Get out of here, right?
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.740]   You get that stuff out of here."
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:06.100]   And then obviously people are going to start fighting back and asking, "Who are you?
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.940]   What authority do you have?"
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:12.540]   And then to make it even matters worse, he takes the tables with all the coins and he
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.900]   smashes them over and flips them upside down, right?
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.780]   And perhaps people are thinking, "Oh my goodness, this guy, he's filled with the evil spirits.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.820]   Look at him, uncontrolled, violent.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.660]   How dare he?"
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.780]   And in our eyes, he would seem just like a crazy man.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:34.060]   This is out of control, rampant, angry person.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:39.300]   But what's more, he prevents anybody from carrying merchandise through.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.540]   So he's literally blocking them, right?
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:52.340]   Now, can you imagine you looking at something so upsetting that you would do those things?
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:57.820]   And what I would like to call our attention to is, think about this then.
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:05.300]   Jesus himself, he is such a patient being, right?
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.380]   He is such a patient being.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:13.420]   Even to those who were, yes, tax collectors, even to those who just talk, talk, talk, and
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:22.820]   even to those who were promiscuous, the prostitutes, Christ was actually very patient.
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:29.620]   But what sets him off is he says, "My house shall be called a house of prayer.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.980]   But look what you have done."
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:36.060]   And I pray that we would meditate on those things.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:43.500]   As we think through this day, this is a day when Jesus expresses his indignation, frustration,
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:52.100]   and anger, not just of one thing, but of a constant pattern of resiliency, like defiance
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.380]   against God's rebuke, and this inability where they would just bear the outside, they were
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:04.940]   just so content to bear the externals, and yet not bear true fruit.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:10.980]   And so from here we know that upon Jesus calling people out, Jesus making this kind of scene,
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:16.660]   the religious leaders are so livid, are so angry, the scripture says, that they were
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:21.660]   now thinking and devising of how to destroy him.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.220]   And so after today, once the day is done, Jesus and the disciples will go back into
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:29.460]   Bethany, but here and now, essentially, in the next days, we're going to see a ramping
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:34.220]   up of the contention and the conflict between Jesus and the leaders.
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:39.260]   For today, as we wrap up, I want us to think about some of the important points of this
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:47.340]   day, recognizing we know that Christ has dedicated himself to walk to the cross, but as he's
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:52.340]   going, he is revealing just how sinful the situation is.
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:57.060]   One of the things I remember and take to heart is when Jesus looks upon Jerusalem, he talks
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:03.540]   about how this is a wicked and perverse generation.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:08.140]   And truthfully speaking, every generation has, including ours.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:14.500]   And when he weeps over the city of Jerusalem, who have gathered together, and he wishes
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:18.740]   that they would have received him, he wishes he could have taken them in, but they were
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:26.380]   just so content to do their normal thing, to sprout leaves, but no fruit.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:31.240]   Likewise, for us, we want to just take a moment to think about our faith.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:38.740]   It is a temptation for us to just be content to look like we're here and present, but we
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.740]   do not want our hearts and we do not want our faith to be fruitless, amen?
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:47.660]   So let's take some time, if you would now bow your heads, and take a minute or two in
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.740]   personal reflection and prayer.
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:54.060]   And after just a few moments, I will lead us in a time of closing prayer.

[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   - Amen.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.240]   Please join me in prayer.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.480]   Heavenly Father, we recognize God,
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.120]   especially as a church we're going through First Peter,
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.400]   and we remember your words, Lord,
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:52.000]   that you have called us for incredible purposes,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.560]   an incredible value, that we would be called children,
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.840]   and therefore we would be your own precious possession,
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.460]   that we would be a people marked by you,
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.760]   a royal priesthood, Lord,
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.040]   to declare the excellencies of our Father.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.360]   And I pray, Father God, with this sense of purpose,
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.400]   we would desire to come with fruits of faith, Lord,
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.880]   where there is more love for you,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.400]   greater thirst for righteousness,
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.640]   and a desire to know you in deeper and greater ways,
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.240]   and God, that we would be used for your purposes.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.280]   But Lord, we also confess our weaknesses
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.000]   that are ever before us,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.280]   and I pray for anybody here who's been struggling,
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.800]   who feels like they've been dry just showing up,
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.200]   and we recognize, Father God,
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.960]   that sometimes we can just fake it,
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.080]   where we come and show our external faces,
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.960]   and yet our insides are far from you.
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.920]   But I pray any time that we see it,
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.000]   I pray, Father God,
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.020]   that you would grant to us spiritual courage
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.960]   to repent, to come to you,
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.400]   and to draw near in every way.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.100]   Father, we recognize, Lord God,
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.720]   that for us to have conviction,
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.200]   for us to have repentance is grace,
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.520]   and I ask that you would regularly grant to us
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.500]   that conviction in the spirit.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.560]   Lord, we ask that as we continue this week,
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:15.880]   you would help us to both see, to remember,
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.280]   but also, Father God, to be moved,
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.460]   so that, Lord, we would draw near to you.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.800]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.360]   Let's all rise together for the closing praise song.

[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.640]   Let's pray together to close the evening.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.520]   Our God, with our hearts gathered,
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.840]   we wanna say to you, thank you.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.820]   And again, Lord, for our Savior to walk this earth.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.800]   What a humbling and what a great sacrifice
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.440]   that in of itself is.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.440]   We thank you, Lord, that you endured the sins of the people.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.460]   We thank you, Father God, that Christ was long-suffering
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:45.840]   in such a way that both the false alliances,
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.760]   allegiance, the forgetfulness, the complete neglect,
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.280]   and sometimes accusation and more,
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.800]   that God Christ suffered through all those things.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.940]   And today we thank you, God,
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.320]   that God you are long-suffering with us,
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.320]   for we recognize our own forgetfulness.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.520]   We recognize, Father God,
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.640]   our own propensity to be so distracted.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:09.420]   But Lord, we wanna pray also that tonight we gather,
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.460]   desiring to come together for you.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.180]   And it is our prayer request, Lord God,
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.400]   that you help us to prioritize you in such a way
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.560]   that our daily walk would truly be abiding with you.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.600]   This we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.960]   All right, thanks everyone for coming.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.800]   Have a great evening.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.540]   Just as a quick note,
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.780]   I am posting on our general Facebook website
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:34.260]   each morning reflection passages for the week.
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.820]   So if you do have time,
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.840]   there are some questions there for you to take time
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.700]   and look at so you can refer to those.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.960]   Thanks so much, everyone.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:50.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
