[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   - Good evening, welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.640]   We have an announcement from our Sister's Ministry.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.840]   So Sister Jen Choi is gonna come
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.200]   and she's gonna give the announcement this morning.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:17.120]   - Can you hear me?
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.940]   Okay.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.680]   My name's Jen Choi and this is an announcement
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.320]   for the Women's Ministry about IWF,
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.680]   which stands for Intentional Wives Fellowship.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.200]   That will be happening September
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.180]   through December of this year.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.920]   This is an opportunity for married women
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.280]   in all seasons of marriage to come together and fellowship.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.640]   And for this session,
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.880]   sisters who are engaged are also invited to join.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.280]   In small groups, we'll be reading
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.900]   "This Momentary Marriage" by John Piper.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.440]   And we pray that sisters would develop
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   a deeper understanding of the biblical meaning of marriage
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.000]   and grow an appreciation of marriage
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.080]   as a display of Christ's covenant love for his church.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.740]   This will be a bi-weekly commitment.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.600]   We'll be having two meeting days available.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.360]   That works best for you.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.080]   One is Friday mornings from 9.30 to 11.30 a.m.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.700]   And the second is Monday evenings
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.980]   with meeting times determined by each small group.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.680]   And meetings will be taking place in person.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.420]   Please sign up through our online form on the Berean app
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.840]   or through the links that will be posted
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.940]   on the Berean Church Facebook page
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.220]   or the Berean Women's Facebook page.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.360]   Deadlines to sign up will be Sunday, August 29th.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.880]   And if you have any questions, please contact Carrie Chang.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.120]   Thank you.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.560]   - All right, thank you.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.200]   Again, all of this announcement is on our church website.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.640]   It's on the Facebook and also on the church app.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.800]   Okay, so if you need more information about that
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.880]   and know who to contact, you can do that as soon as,
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.600]   again, if you go to those avenues.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.840]   Next Sunday, we have a communion service.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.500]   So please prepare for that, for the first
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.120]   and second service.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.120]   And then on August 21st, we have a church maintenance day.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.240]   And so obviously, we've opened up the church on both sides
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.440]   and there's more needs than we've had before.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.320]   And so we wanna really encourage you,
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.280]   if you are able to come that Saturday,
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.040]   to come and help us to kind of maintain the church.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.560]   And I've already shared this with our members
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.080]   that our philosophy at church is,
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.960]   we wanna run the church with the help of the church
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.800]   as much as possible.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.120]   Instead of just hiring, we want the people to be engaged
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.420]   and look at this building as just not something
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.240]   that the leaders are taking care of,
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.560]   but that the church is taking care of.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.520]   And so if you're able to come that day,
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.460]   please sign up for that because we can use the hand
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.360]   that Saturday.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.280]   And also, fall Bible study that's coming up.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.120]   So today is the first day that the inductive
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.680]   Bible study lessons to help you prepare
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.840]   for the Bible study that's coming up.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.260]   So that's starting today.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.100]   But the regular Bible study for everybody else,
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.760]   Wednesday Bible study, and then the home group
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.120]   Bible study is happening.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.880]   So again, if you haven't signed up, please do that ASAP.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.040]   Okay, and then one other announcement
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.680]   is that usually we have a summer retreat
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.580]   that's coming up in a couple weeks.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.160]   And so not next weekend, but the weekend after that,
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.240]   we have the retreat coming up.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.680]   And usually we have an in-person service
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.020]   where we have a guest speaker come
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.920]   and while we're having service out there.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.840]   But this year, because basically almost everybody
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.040]   at church is going, so we won't be able
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.600]   to run a live church here.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.140]   So we have three suggestions, okay?
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.920]   So one is that if you are able to,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.440]   to make the drive out there,
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.560]   'cause the live service is gonna be happening
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.960]   about an hour and 15 minute, hour and 10 minute,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.440]   depending on how you drive, is gonna be out there.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.340]   So you can come join us for the morning service
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.140]   and then you can just stick around and have lunch with us.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.040]   And so that's available for you.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.760]   Number two is to find a local church somewhere
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.320]   where you can physically attend.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.800]   And so if you have a church that you're able to go to,
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.520]   we recommend that you do that.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.680]   And then the third option is we are going
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.260]   to be live streaming the Sunday worship
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.200]   that's happening at the retreat site.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.800]   And so if you go online to our website or Facebook page,
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.240]   you'll be able to access that.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.920]   Now out of the three, obviously in order,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.680]   if you're able to make it, number one,
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.800]   we suggest that that be your option.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.320]   And then the number two, if you can't make it there,
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   that you find a physical church that you are able to go to,
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.440]   that would be a second option.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.400]   And third would be another option,
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.080]   but the least of the favorite option,
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.480]   if you're able to come physically,
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.880]   we ask that you guys participate in that way, okay?
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.080]   All right, so this morning, after we have our worship time,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.820]   we have a brother, Chris, who's gonna come up
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.660]   and give his testimony.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.500]   He'll be baptized this morning.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.480]   And let me pray for us for our offering,
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.420]   give you an opportunity to give.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.760]   And then again, if you did bring a physical offering,
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.860]   there is a basket in the back,
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.020]   that little birdhouse over there,
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.500]   that's the offering basket.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.820]   So you can drop it off there as you are exiting, okay?
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.320]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.400]   Heavenly Father, we just wanna thank you so much
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.680]   for your continued blessing that you give.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.880]   Lord, whatever it is that we have been entangled with
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.080]   coming into this room, I pray that our worship,
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.140]   our giving, our time of your word, fellowship,
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.920]   may it all cause us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.360]   I ask for your grace, and we know that even the worship
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.560]   that we give, that we are in need of your spirit
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.960]   to guide and lead us.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.280]   So we pray for your blessing this time.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.860]   We pray, Lord God, that even the offering that we give,
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.200]   help us to give it to you joyfully, cheerfully,
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.000]   willingly as an act of worship,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.440]   that it may be multiplied for your use.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.220]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.140]   (soft piano music)
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.060]   (soft piano music)
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.980]   (soft piano music)
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:24:04.520]   (soft piano music)
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.440]   (soft piano music)
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:30.160]   All right, Church family, would you please stand with us
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.560]   as we continue our worship?
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.700]   (soft music)

[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:46.560]   - Hey guys, I'm Chris and I'm going into my fourth year
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.000]   at UCI and this is my testimony.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.200]   Growing up in the church and in a Christian household,
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.980]   I heard the gospel and attended church, Sunday school,
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.000]   and BBS at an early age.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.960]   I would always pray before meals,
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.400]   read and hear stories from the Bible,
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.900]   and discuss church-related topics with friends and family.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.200]   This all became habitual and I never really questioned it
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.540]   because it was what people did around me.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.880]   Others in the church would share the gospel with me
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.920]   at day camps and every year I accepted Christ as my Savior
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.320]   without hesitation since I had already heard it
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.160]   and everyone else was doing the same.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.280]   I thought that as long as I was a good person
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.380]   attending church and simply knew that Jesus died
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.740]   on the cross for my sins,
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.740]   that I would call myself a Christian
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.600]   and deem myself a genuine believer.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.380]   Fast forward to middle school and high school,
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.460]   I continued living my life with this mentality
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.540]   and pursued academic success with Christ in the background.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.780]   I began to put all my efforts into school
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.940]   and in my academic accomplishments.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.580]   I had a strong work ethic, which is not inherently wrong,
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.260]   but it allowed me to excel in school
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.820]   and take pride in my success.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.800]   Living in the Bay Area only further motivated my pursuit
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.040]   of man's approval since I was constantly surrounded
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.560]   by successful and wealthy individuals and corporations.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.520]   I still consider myself a genuine believer
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.360]   and I did not go out and party or hang out
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.740]   with the wrong crowd, but I still wasn't different
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.480]   from the rest of the world since I pursued worldly success
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.160]   by constantly chasing the next grade
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.080]   and never being satisfied,
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.820]   the next internship opportunity or achievement
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.080]   rather than turning to the word or to prayer.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.020]   In some instances, church became an inconvenience for me
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.480]   and I would skip it if I had too much work to do.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.880]   I did all of this just to beef up my college application
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.800]   and in hopes of going to the best college
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.400]   I could possibly get into so that I could pursue
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.960]   a stable career and live a comfortable life.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.240]   By the time college admissions came around,
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.060]   I did not get into my dream schools
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.840]   and attended UCI feeling ungrateful and filled with pride,
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.560]   thinking that I deserved to be somewhere better
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.080]   and continue to be consumed by school
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.120]   and success while church hopping every once in a while.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.420]   However, God quickly humbled me as I struggled
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.080]   academically for the first time in my life.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.800]   No matter how hard I worked, I was failing
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.820]   to meet the expectations I had set for myself.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:11.040]   This process of struggling made me realize
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.080]   how much hope I had placed into a temporary satisfaction
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.560]   and how far my heart was from God.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.840]   One Sunday while church hopping,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.640]   I heard a sermon on Matthew 7.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.360]   Matthew 7, 21 to 23 states,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.600]   "Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord,
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.000]   "will enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.820]   "but he who does the will of my Father
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.740]   "who is in heaven will enter.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.080]   "Many will say to me on that day,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.720]   "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.360]   "and in your name cast out demons
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.740]   "and in your name perform many miracles?
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.900]   "And then I will declare to them,
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.560]   "I never knew you, depart from me,
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.800]   "you who practice lawlessness."
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.360]   Up until this point, I had only gone to God
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.800]   when I needed him or when I was struggling
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.120]   with selfish things like school.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.260]   My prayers were filled with self-centered desires
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.120]   to get me through difficult situations
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.920]   so that I could continue to pursue
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.360]   what I wanted from the world.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.800]   I had turned God into my therapist
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.440]   and created my own version of him,
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.800]   thinking that I could use him to glorify myself
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.000]   and achieve whatever was on my own agenda.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.220]   This all showed my lack of knowledge in the God
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.000]   that the Bible describes him to be.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.680]   And throughout my time in college,
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.280]   I gradually learned more about the loving
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.640]   and sacrificial God who sent his only son,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.120]   Jesus Christ, to die for my sins
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.680]   that were blinding me from the rest
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.980]   of the truth of scripture and his sovereignty.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.040]   Through his perfect justice, I deserve to be condemned,
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.360]   but through his spirit, I now live to serve him
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.720]   and glorify his kingdom rather than my own
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.480]   like I was before.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   I still struggle with sin, but no longer place my hope
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.920]   in perishable things like my success or career,
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.880]   but the resurrection and eternity with him.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   Although my plan did not necessarily pan out
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.360]   the way I wanted it to, I can see God's faithfulness
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.720]   and patience with me.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.080]   He challenged my humility and revealed my brokenness
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.760]   by bringing me to UCI and placed people in my life
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.280]   who have encouraged me and challenged me
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.560]   in my faith as well.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.320]   Though I was undeserving and fell short many times,
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.720]   God was patient and welcomed me into his body.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.840]   And through the gospel, I know that I can trust his hand
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.040]   in everything and place my hope in eternity.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.800]   First Peter 1, 24 to 25 says,
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.480]   all flesh is like grass and all its glory
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.780]   like the flower of grass.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.800]   The grass withers and the flower falls off,
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.880]   but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.720]   Thank you.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.040]   (audience chattering)
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.200]   (audience applauding)
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.100]   the word of the Lord endures forever.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:39.940]   Thank you.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.100]   (audience applauding)
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.260]   (audience chattering)
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:39:07.460]   (audience applauding)
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.580]   (audience applauding)
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:17.740]   - All right, thank you for that testimony.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.680]   If the rest of you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.780]   to Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:29.620]   Hebrews chapter 12, we're gonna be reading
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.420]   from verse 18 through 24, and we're gonna be finishing up
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.260]   what I started a few weeks ago, okay?
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.340]   Yeah, and I won't be making any promises anymore, all right?
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:47.020]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 18 through 24.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.660]   And again, I'm gonna finish up the third point
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.860]   that I started last week but wasn't able to finish.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.700]   Reading from the NASB.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:02.180]   For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched,
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.700]   and to a blazing fire, and to darkness,
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.140]   and gloom, and whirlwind, and to the blast of a trumpet,
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.580]   and the sound of words which sound with such
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.540]   that those who heard begged that no further word
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.540]   be spoken to them.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.140]   For they could not bear the command,
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.820]   if even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.500]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said,
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.580]   "I am full of fear and trembling."
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.140]   But you have come to Mount Zion,
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.740]   and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.920]   and to the myriads of angels,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.860]   to the general assembly and church of the firstborn
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.900]   who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all,
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.060]   and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.280]   and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.460]   and to the sprinkled blood which speaks better
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.900]   than the blood of Abel.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.720]   Let's pray.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:56.140]   Heavenly Father, as we come before you,
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.780]   we ask, Lord God, that you would protect this pulpit,
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.460]   that you would use it, Lord God, to declare your word,
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.300]   and your word alone.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.140]   I pray that you would soften our hearts, open our ears,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.680]   and give us wills to apply.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.300]   May your word be proclaimed, and as you have ordained it,
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.180]   not return until it has accomplished the purpose
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.620]   you have given it for.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.420]   And so we pray for guidance, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:24.900]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.420]   In your memory of your life, up to this point,
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:32.620]   whether it's 18, or 60, or 70, however old you may be,
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.580]   up to this point, what is your happiest memory in life?
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:40.420]   You know, just think for a second.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:45.300]   As I was preparing this message,
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.740]   I was kind of contemplating,
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.460]   what's the happiest memory that I remember?
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.740]   There's three distinct things that I remember,
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.200]   and I remember the first memory was in 1975,
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.780]   when my father came to the United States first in 1974
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.500]   to get his doctorate, and so we were separated
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:06.340]   for about a year, and then when we first came in 1975,
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:11.340]   I remember just so eager to see the plane doors opening
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.320]   so we can run to our dad and then be reunited with him,
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.100]   and so that's one of the most fondest memory
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.060]   I have of childhood.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.900]   And then as an adult, the fondest memory that I remember
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.840]   is when I got married, and Esther and I,
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.080]   we were driving up to San Francisco on our honeymoon,
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.940]   and so that was our honeymoon,
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.620]   so we were just kind of driving up,
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.540]   and we were playing John Gibson.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.360]   Some of you guys may know who he is,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.280]   may or may not know who he is,
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.940]   but he was the only Christian tape we had,
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.200]   and so we probably played that about 20 times,
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.520]   so every once in a while, I hear that tape,
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.160]   and to this day, it reminds me of that drive up the,
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.600]   I think the Pacific Coast Highway
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.720]   that we took the long, nice route, right?
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.000]   We were in no hurry, and I remember just fond memory
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.920]   of that, just being so happy
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.680]   that finally I was able to marry Esther.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.440]   And then the other memory that I remember very specifically
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.760]   was Esther already had two miscarriages,
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.040]   and when she got pregnant with Jeremy,
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.560]   the doctor already told us that she couldn't have,
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.480]   that it was a miscarriage, and the doctor already told us
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.840]   that she couldn't have children in the normal way,
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.880]   and so we were already talking about
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.360]   possibly adopting in the future,
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.640]   maybe that's what God wants,
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.280]   and then, so she didn't really do anything
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.320]   for the third pregnancy.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.000]   She actually went to Magic Mountain,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.680]   'cause I was a youth pastor, a college pastor,
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.040]   so we took our group.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.280]   She went on the revolution, you know,
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.680]   'cause she liked roller coasters,
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.600]   because we thought she already had the miscarriage,
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.280]   and then she went back by herself for a follow-up meeting,
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.160]   and then she came back with the ultrasound and said,
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.400]   oh, the baby lived.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.320]   And then since then, we've had three other children, right?
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.600]   And so I just remember that very distinctly,
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.080]   that day when she came back with that,
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.480]   just shock and excitement,
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.800]   and those are memories that I can take very distinctly
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.560]   that I remember, but of all the memories that I have,
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.600]   and as great as those memories are,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.680]   the first day that I met Christ
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:17.560]   is by far anything that I've ever experienced.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.240]   Because I knew that day
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.200]   that my life would completely change, right?
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.640]   You know, some people, it takes them time,
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.520]   it's a process to understand what was happening,
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.640]   but that day, every bitterness, every anger,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.160]   every regret, all of a sudden,
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.640]   it disappeared when I met Christ.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.400]   And even though this is a Christ that I sang about,
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.000]   you know, memorized verses in Sunday school,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.440]   but this was different.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.800]   He was real, he wasn't just a figure,
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.760]   figure, you know, some big picture God,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.120]   he was personal, he answered my prayer,
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.640]   and I met him for the first time.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.440]   And, you know, our small group leaders told me
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.760]   that I was singing in my sleep, you know,
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.840]   the new songs that I learned,
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.400]   and that I was just mumbling as we were driving down,
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.160]   you know, and to this day,
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.800]   when I think of like one that stands out,
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.640]   as great as those memories are,
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:19.600]   the day that I met Christ was the happiest day of my life,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.480]   and it changed me forever.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:27.720]   The Bible says that Zion is a place where we're headed,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.520]   that as great as whatever you've experienced
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.760]   up to this point, pales in comparison
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.040]   to the joy and the celebration that we're gonna have
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.240]   when we meet Christ.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.880]   And so we talked about how in the previous passage
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.200]   that it's a place of celebration,
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.560]   and it was equated with a wedding banquet,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.880]   and the angels are gonna be there celebrating with us.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.000]   The elders, the pure church, right?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.200]   Not just people who are gathered
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.520]   because of whatever the reason,
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.440]   but the pure church is gonna be gathered together.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.040]   And he says, along with that,
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.560]   God who's the judge, who's gonna protect us
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.760]   and guide us and lead us in righteousness,
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.240]   he will be there, obviously.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.760]   And then the text that we're looking at
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.640]   that I wanna get to where he says,
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.760]   this is where the spirits of the righteous
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.240]   will be made perfect.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.120]   Spirit of the righteous who will be made perfect,
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.760]   meaning that those who believed in God
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.600]   who went ahead of us,
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.280]   that's where the final destination's going to be,
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.200]   and ultimately it will be our final destination.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.600]   That what he started here,
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.360]   he will perfect it when Christ comes.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.820]   But that word perfect
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.100]   is a theologically rich word, teleos.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.500]   In fact, back in seminary,
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.820]   I did a whole paper just on this word, teleos.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.220]   It's kind of very similar to the word agape.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.540]   You can do a whole series on the word agape,
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.180]   or another word in the New Testament,
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.220]   the word meno, to remain.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.980]   That's another word that can't be translated with one word.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.900]   And so in the Greek, in Colossians 1:28,
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.380]   it says, "We proclaim him admonishing every man
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.580]   "and teaching every man with all wisdom
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.460]   "so that they may present every man complete in Christ."
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.580]   And that word is teleos.
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:16.780]   In the NIV, it says, "To be made perfect in Christ."
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.960]   And in the ESV, it says, "To be made mature in Christ."
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.180]   So the word perfect, teleos, in this passage
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.380]   is not referring to perfect
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:30.260]   as in reference to not being perfect,
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.400]   not having some sort of a defect.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.300]   The word perfect has the idea of fulfilling,
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.140]   meaning to bring to conclusion what was started.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.220]   That's what the word means.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.820]   And so theologians call this theology here and not yet.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.580]   God initiated the salvation, justification.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.480]   We are in the process of sanctification,
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.220]   but ultimately we will get to glorification when he comes.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.660]   But these are not three separate things.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.780]   These are all one thing that he describes
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.780]   in different ways to help us understand.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.580]   So the word teleos has the idea
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.260]   of reaching its goal, to fulfilling its purpose,
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:13.080]   to reach the finish line, to finish the term,
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:16.140]   and to make something complete and full,
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.860]   that there is nothing more than that,
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.860]   meaning that everything that God has started here
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.360]   is going to be fulfilled when we are in heaven.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.720]   And as great as that day was when I met Christ,
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.540]   he said it was just the initiation.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.620]   Every other memory that I have on this earth
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.580]   and probably that you have is temporary.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.260]   As great as that memory of meeting my father,
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.500]   it's temporary, and it's only for me.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.420]   And as great as it was that the day that I got married,
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.540]   it's only here.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.120]   Whatever memories that you may have,
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.180]   it's temporary because life is temporary.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.420]   But what he initiated with us,
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.780]   he said he's going to teleos.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.980]   He's going to bring it to completion.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.380]   And we talked about that last week,
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.380]   how heaven is a place of celebration.
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.500]   And he says it, John 15, 11,
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.020]   "These things I have spoken to you
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.540]   "so that my joy may be in you,
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:14.540]   "and that your joy may be made full, complete, teleos."
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.560]   That what he initiated, this joy, this celebration,
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.780]   we're going to be in heaven celebrating in its fulfillment.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.460]   John 10, 10, "The thief comes only to steal
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.300]   "and to kill and to destroy.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.140]   "I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.940]   To the full, it says in the NIV.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.780]   So the purpose of salvation
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.140]   isn't simply to save us from judgment.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.500]   He saved us from judgment so that we may have this zoe
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:45.380]   and have it eternally and have it to the fullest.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.200]   So anything that you and I have experienced on this earth
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.940]   was just the initiation of that.
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.720]   And that's why the Bible calls us to taste
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.220]   and see that the Lord is good.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.940]   Because if you have tasted his goodness,
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.260]   that taste is what drives us to pursue him further.
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.620]   That taste is what causes us to praise him and worship him.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.860]   In Luke chapter 10, 17 to 20,
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.940]   Jesus sends out the 70 disciples and they come back
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.660]   elated, joyful, happy,
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.540]   because they were able to cast out demons in his name.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.300]   Remember we talked about the power of angels,
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.700]   whether they were fallen angels
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.260]   or whether they're angels worshiping God, serving God.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.580]   Angels were powerful beings.
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.260]   Remember we talked about how one angel
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.440]   wiped out 185,000 Assyrian soldiers?
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.420]   That's how powerful they were.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.260]   So the disciples were aware of that.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.620]   In fact, angels were so venerated
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:43.420]   that some people in the early church
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.260]   started to strain, actually started to worship angels.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.060]   So they knew how powerful these angels were.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.260]   They were living in fear of these demons.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.660]   They went out in the name of Jesus
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.020]   and they started casting out demons.
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.180]   They come back and say, Lord, even the demons
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.940]   are subject to us in your name.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.860]   And he said to them, Jesus said to them,
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.820]   I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.620]   Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.640]   and scorpions and over all power and enemy
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.500]   and nothing will injure you.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.260]   Imagine the joy and excitement of hearing that
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.440]   and seeing the kind of power that God has given,
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.320]   Jesus has given them.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.700]   But Jesus says in verse 20, nevertheless,
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:24.040]   do not rejoice in this,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.640]   that the spirits are subject to you,
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:29.580]   but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.620]   There are other times it recorded
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.460]   where the disciples were trying to cast out demons
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.360]   and they couldn't cast out
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.860]   because the demons were too powerful
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:39.940]   and they come back discouraged.
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:41.300]   The reason, what he is saying here,
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.860]   he's not saying don't rejoice or don't be happy.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.280]   He said, if you're gonna place your hope in anything,
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.700]   place your hope in something that cannot be taken away,
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.660]   that the Son of God died for you.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.440]   If you're gonna rejoice in anything,
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:00.260]   rejoice over the fact that the Son of God loves you.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.760]   In fact, in Luke chapter 15, verse 10,
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.200]   it says in the same way, I tell you,
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.880]   there is joy in the presence of the angels of God
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.420]   over one sinner who repents.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:16.440]   It says whole heaven rejoices when a sinner repents.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.200]   People ask me, as the church grows,
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:22.880]   right,
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.260]   how big do you want the church to get?
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.740]   Now, I don't know the motive behind that question, right,
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.900]   'cause I can't read what they're asking.
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.720]   I think part of it is because,
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.180]   especially if you came to our church
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.460]   when our church was small, you know,
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.060]   and as the church grows, there's an initial excitement.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.940]   It's like, oh, the church is growing, church is growing,
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.180]   and then it grows to a certain point.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.620]   It's like, eh, it's just not the same.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.580]   'Cause some of you guys remember
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.180]   when our church was smaller, where, you know,
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:55.320]   you knew every part of my house, right?
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.540]   You knew every part of my house,
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.060]   'cause we had Wednesday Bible study there,
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.780]   Friday Bible study, we had, you know, leaders meeting,
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.460]   and we even celebrated New Year's Eve.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.380]   You know, I'm sure our neighbors didn't like that,
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.420]   but we did everything out of our house.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:11.620]   So we had intimate, you know, intimate relationship.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:13.540]   And I remember when our church was young,
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:16.940]   remember when we would send people off to China?
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:18.500]   You know, we had 120 people,
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:21.540]   and 120 people would show up at the airport
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.560]   to send people off.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.920]   You know, our church was known as a loitering church,
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:31.540]   because once we got together, we would never leave, you know?
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:34.100]   And so every once in a while, somebody may ask,
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.060]   and again, I'm not saying that that's the reason behind it,
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.020]   but I know sometimes when that question is asked,
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.420]   it's because how do we manage this growth?
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:46.420]   You know, at some point, maybe that's it.
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.740]   And so whenever they ask me that question,
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.580]   I tell them, "How big do you want the church to get?"
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.140]   It's like, "Seven billion."
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.860]   Seven billion, that's my goal.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.740]   So until then, we're gonna keep growing, okay?
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.300]   If the purpose of our church,
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.980]   and the reason why we're doing what we're doing
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:07.420]   is to build our kingdom, even 10 is too big.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.480]   Five is too big, even one is too big.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.300]   But if our goal is to reach the lost,
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.380]   the Bible says every sinner that comes to Christ,
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.780]   he says, "Heavens rejoice."
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.100]   Some of the greatest joys in my life
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:25.300]   after I became a Christian was seeing sinners come to Christ.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.620]   I remember, and this was the second person
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:32.100]   that I was able to share the gospel that came to Christ.
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.780]   It made such an impact in my life.
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:36.700]   We were up in Seattle, Washington,
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:40.180]   and this is when I was about sophomore in college.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.700]   And our Bible study leader took us out,
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.420]   and we were in downtown Seattle,
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.180]   and they were trying to share the gospel,
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.900]   but there was this homeless man that stood out to me.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.500]   And I could tell he had a bit of alcohol in his breath,
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.940]   but he wasn't drunk.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.700]   So as I was walking around, and I stopped,
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.500]   and I tried to share the gospel with him,
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.400]   and you could tell he's just not having it.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.980]   You know, I'm like, "Get that trash away from me."
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.020]   And he was angry, and then I was kind of curious.
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.580]   And normally, I would just kind of walk by
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.180]   and talk to somebody who's more interested,
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.220]   but I could tell in his eyes that he,
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:18.340]   even as he was angry, that he wanted to engage.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.900]   So I asked him, "Hey, can I ask you a personal question?
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.740]   "And if you're offended, you don't have to answer me."
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.720]   But I said, "What happened?
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.980]   "How'd you get out of here?"
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.220]   And then, with tears in his eyes,
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.220]   he started to share with me.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:36.180]   He said he was a middle-class engineer,
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.700]   had a nice house, had a wife that he loved,
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.340]   and had two small children.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:46.460]   And he had a great life, except him and his wife
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:49.500]   got into this habit of doing drugs.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.420]   So after work, they, her, him and his wife would do drugs,
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.480]   and it just got more severe.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:58.300]   And one day, he came home and found his wife overdosed,
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.460]   and she died from that.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.820]   He loved her, and you could tell he loved her.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:07.940]   And so, as he's telling me this story, he's weeping,
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.980]   and he said, "I just lost all motivation to live."
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.500]   And so, eventually, he lost his job.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.540]   Because he lost his job, he couldn't pay for his house,
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.460]   and so he lost his home.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.180]   Because he lost his job, he lost his home,
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.060]   he couldn't pay the bills, so the government came
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.800]   and took the small children away from him.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:28.220]   And then, he just said, after that, it was just,
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.260]   "I just wanna die, but I just can't."
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.500]   And he was out in the street,
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.900]   drowning his sorrows whenever he can.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:40.460]   And so, I was, obviously, I wanted to help him,
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:42.820]   but it's like, I remember that story,
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.180]   Peter and John at the temple,
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.920]   like they're begging for money, he says,
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.180]   "Silver and gold I have none,
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.980]   "but what I have I give unto you."
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.620]   I don't have any dollars, I don't have any coins,
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.460]   but can I share with you something that happened to me?
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.860]   And I started sharing my testimony,
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.660]   and then I started to share the gospel with him.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.420]   And so, I went through the whole,
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.100]   that we all have to fall short of the way,
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.380]   how I was trained in college, and I came to the end,
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:14.060]   and he was very attentive, and I asked him at the end,
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.940]   "Do you want to accept Jesus Christ?"
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.580]   And he eagerly said, "Yes."
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.380]   So, I'm a little bit skeptical.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:25.180]   You know, this is, I probably, by that time,
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.780]   shared the gospel maybe about 100 times,
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.900]   but he's only the second guy who was interested.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.940]   And so, I said, "Is this guy real or not?"
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.660]   Maybe he wants money, maybe he's just kind of like,
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.940]   going through the motion.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.860]   So, I said, "But let's pray."
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.100]   So, you know, I was just, we were standing there
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.860]   with all these people walking around,
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:43.980]   and they started staring at us,
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.940]   'cause he saw me engage him.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:46.940]   And then when I said, "Let's pray,"
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.100]   he grabbed my arms and he got on his knees.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.300]   So, he pulled me down with him.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.780]   So, this is the middle of downtown,
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.860]   people walking around, and I'm embarrassed.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.460]   You know, but we're gonna pray.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.980]   So, I led him through the prayer,
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.180]   and as I was leading him through the prayer,
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.940]   I say, "Lord, I'm a sinner, I need you.
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.260]   "I believe in Christ, he died for my sins."
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.900]   And I could hear him weeping.
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:13.700]   And after we finished the prayer,
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:15.500]   he opened his eyes and I looked at his eyes,
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.860]   he was not the same guy.
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:19.420]   He was not the same guy.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:23.540]   He genuinely repented and accepted Christ,
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.580]   and he got up on his feet, and then he said,
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.660]   "Give me your tracts."
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.220]   So, I had a pocket full of tracts
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.580]   that I was trying to hand out,
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.620]   and he took all of it, he said,
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.180]   "I'm gonna tell my friends."
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:36.660]   And I didn't live in Oregon at that time,
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.980]   or Seattle at that time, so our leader said,
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.300]   "Hey, we have to go," so we packed up,
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.460]   and I wasn't able to follow up with him.
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:43.580]   But I remember that experience
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.820]   made such a deep impression in me.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:48.100]   What could I have possibly given this man
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.460]   to change his situation?
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:51.940]   Even if I was a millionaire,
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.420]   gave him $100,000, couldn't bring his wife back,
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:57.060]   his children, everything that he lost,
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.660]   he just wanted to disappear.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:03.860]   But what I did give him was a hope in Christ,
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.580]   his sin forgiven.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:09.060]   And I could tell he had a new reason to live.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:12.140]   So, it was at that time I thought to myself,
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.660]   I didn't think about pastoral ministry,
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.820]   but I said, "This is what I wanna do
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.620]   "the rest of my life.
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.260]   "I wanna tell people about Jesus Christ.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.540]   "I wanna spend the rest of my life
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.460]   "and give my full attention to share the gospel
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.380]   "to as many people as possible."
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.100]   Not simply because it was an obligation,
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:30.580]   not because the Bible said so,
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.540]   because it brought so much joy.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.980]   To see that joy in his heart
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.820]   brought so much joy in my heart.
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:43.980]   The Bible says that true celebration is coming.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.140]   And once we forget that,
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.540]   Christianity becomes such a burden.
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:52.780]   It's like things that we need to do.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.100]   I mean, life is hard enough as it is.
[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.660]   Those of you who have small children at home,
[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:58.460]   you're huffing and puffing just to make it out
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.580]   of the door in the morning.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.900]   You come back and you're exhausted and tired.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.380]   And if your walk with Christ
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.180]   isn't because it produces the greatest joy,
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:11.460]   on top of all the burden of living in this sinful world,
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:15.340]   you have to appease this God that you cannot appease.
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.180]   You have relational problems at church,
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.460]   you have relational problems at home,
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.420]   and you're trying to do it, constantly feeling guilty,
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.580]   because that's all Christianity is
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:28.140]   if you don't know the joy that Christ brings.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.580]   You know the parables,
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.580]   the three parables in Luke chapter 15?
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.260]   Jesus gives the same three parables
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:42.620]   because he was hanging out with the sinners, right?
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.940]   The prostitutes and the tax collectors
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.220]   and the Pharisees and the scribes became angry
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.180]   because he was gaining a lot of popularity
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.740]   and they thought that they needed to be pure.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.740]   We need to keep the law perfectly
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.060]   in order to get God's blessings
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.020]   so that God doesn't condemn us again.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.660]   So here's this Messiah and all these people
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.740]   are coming to him and yet he's hanging around with the sinners.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.820]   He's going to ruin God's blessing for us.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.340]   So they became angry with him.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.940]   And in response to that, he tells these three parables.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.300]   The parable of the 99,
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.060]   leaving the 99 and going after the one lost sheep.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.860]   Parable of the one silver coin that's lost
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.380]   and she sweeps the whole house and gets it.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.180]   And then the parable of the prodigal son.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.900]   And all three parables are really meant
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.900]   to be understood together
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.500]   because it makes the same point.
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.020]   The first point that he makes with these three parables
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:38.380]   is that they did not understand the heart of God.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.660]   They said, "Oh, we need to be pure.
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.900]   We need to be holy."
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.340]   And he said, "You don't know the heart of God."
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.700]   He would leave the 99.
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.100]   He's not saying he's going to forsake them,
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.540]   but how every single sheep is precious.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.900]   Every single soul is precious.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.620]   So he was reversing the table and he said,
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.100]   "You're saying that we don't know God."
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.700]   And Jesus said, "No, you do not know God.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.060]   This is who God is."
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.500]   He would leave the 99 to go after the one.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:07.180]   He would leave, sweep the whole house and get one.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.980]   He's eagerly waiting for the prodigal son to come back.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.860]   If we dissect these parables,
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.900]   we can say there's certain parts of it
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.220]   that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:22.900]   Because the third part of this message,
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.780]   or another universal part of this message
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.780]   is that once he finds them, he celebrates.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.060]   Now I'm thinking about that,
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.300]   when he comes back with that one sheep
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.540]   and they say, "Hey, I found this one sheep.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.380]   Let's celebrate."
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.060]   And usually when they celebrate, they slaughter the sheep.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.300]   They find one coin, they say, "Oh, I found this coin.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.300]   Let's spend the other ones to celebrate."
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.940]   But the point of that is not about the coin.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.500]   The point of that is not about the sheep.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.900]   The point of it is how it is precious,
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.540]   how every single one of these things are precious.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.380]   And that's the point that he was trying to make.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.940]   You've forgotten your calling.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.100]   The only reason why the nation of Israel was called
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.580]   is so that he would bless them
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.820]   and then through them, bless the world.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.860]   So that the sinners may come to him.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:16.620]   But you've used your blessing to get on a pedestal
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.380]   and look down at everybody else.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.940]   So his point was, you do not know the heart of God.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:27.940]   God celebrates the salvation of each sinner when they repent.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:34.140]   And if you look at the prodigal son's message,
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:40.420]   he says in verse 15, the prodigal son wasn't able
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:42.540]   or wasn't willing to wait until the father died
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.540]   because he was not the first son and he wanted my possession.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.500]   He takes it and we know the story.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.660]   He goes back and he just blows it, right?
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.220]   But look, look at the way it's described.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.420]   So when he went and hired himself out to the one
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:56.740]   of the citizens of the country
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.820]   and he sent him into the fields to feed what?
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.180]   Swine, right?
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.020]   Who is this?
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.220]   What is a swine?
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.420]   Right, it's a dirty animal.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.620]   And who is this man?
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:07.460]   He's a Jew.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:11.060]   He grew up in a faithful Jewish home
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.300]   and for him to work to feed swine
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.260]   is the lowest job that he can have.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.660]   And Jesus is telling this story on purpose
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:23.700]   to demonstrate just how far he fell.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.660]   And then the very next page, verse it says in verse 16,
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.300]   and he would have gladly filled his stomach
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.500]   with the pods that the swine were eating
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.860]   and no one was giving anything to him.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:38.500]   Not only was he feeding the swine, he fell so far.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.020]   He said he was willing to eat what they eat.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:46.020]   That would have been so sacrilegious for a Jewish man.
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.540]   But that's the point that Jesus is trying to make.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.980]   That's how desperate he became.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.740]   And it wasn't until he became that desperate
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.740]   he realized what he did.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:55.900]   And he says in the next verse,
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.060]   but when he came to his senses,
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.300]   he said, how many of my father's hired men
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.380]   have more than enough bread,
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.460]   but I am dying here with hunger.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.340]   I will get up and go to my father
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.660]   and will say to him, father, I have sinned against heaven
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.700]   and in your sight I am no longer worthy
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.660]   to be called your son.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.420]   Make me as one of your hired men.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.540]   He was so filled with pride when he demanded
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.580]   to have his possession and left,
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.620]   but it wasn't until he fell flat on his face
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.620]   and he was so hungry, he was willing to eat swine food,
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.780]   he realized what he had with his father.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.140]   And this was him repenting.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:35.460]   I remember when I first became a Christian,
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:38.460]   I was so excited about my faith.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:42.020]   I didn't know much about the Bible,
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.060]   even though I grew up in a pastor's home.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.060]   I didn't know much about the Bible.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.060]   We moved around so much,
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.540]   but I was just so eager to tell people about God
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.740]   and I remember in my mind thinking
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:57.540]   that I'm gonna preach to as many people as possible.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.860]   I'm gonna see revival
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.060]   and I've always wanted to be in the military
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.700]   and I fantasized about that.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.540]   I wanted to be a general.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.500]   I was like, I'm gonna be a general in the kingdom of God.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.800]   I remember thinking that as a young Christian.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:14.740]   And then, just like many young Christians,
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:15.860]   reality set in.
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.900]   My flesh didn't disappear.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.300]   I started struggling with the same things.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.700]   Started getting into fights.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.560]   I was still disappointing my parents.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:31.340]   Purity, it didn't just disappear.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:35.620]   And so every Friday, we had a prayer meeting in LA
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.540]   and every Friday, I was praying for forgiveness.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.380]   Every Friday.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:44.700]   In fact, I prayed so much for forgiveness,
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.700]   I was crying out to every Friday, just God, forgive me.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.180]   And I would sit on Monday and I would wait till Friday
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.700]   so that I can repent and get restored
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.580]   and this was a cycle over and over.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:56.940]   And I didn't realize just how loud I was when I was praying.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.300]   One of our Bible study leaders pulled me aside
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.540]   and said, Peter, we can't pray when you pray.
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.700]   I was so hurt by that 'cause like I'm praying to God
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.620]   and he's telling me, this guy's leading me Bible study.
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.220]   He's telling me to stop praying.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:12.140]   I must have been really loud
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.700]   because every Friday, I was pounding God,
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.860]   forgive me, God, forgive me.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.140]   And then it got to a point where I got tired.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.460]   I got tired of repenting.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.860]   I got disappointed in myself.
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.100]   And it wasn't because of a temptation in the world.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.100]   It wasn't because some discouragement.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.900]   It was just, how can I go to God again?
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:35.100]   And so for about a year and a half, I fell away
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:35.940]   from my faith.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:40.820]   I just kind of let myself be and I started getting
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.580]   into things that I didn't get into even before
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.260]   I became a Christian.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.940]   'Cause I became a Christian when I was 16.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.820]   When I backslid, I was about 18 years old.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:52.140]   And so my friends that I didn't talk to for a while,
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:54.860]   they started driving, have money.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.900]   And so we got into things that I didn't get into
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.380]   even before I was a Christian.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.820]   So I remember this one particular night,
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.740]   about a year and a half of just doing this,
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:04.980]   that we got wasted.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:08.340]   We just got, I'm not gonna get into the details,
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.980]   but we got wasted.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.420]   And we barely made it home.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.780]   He dropped me off at my parents' apartment,
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.660]   got home about 3.30 in the morning.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.740]   And I was sitting in the living room,
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:22.540]   in the middle of the night, in my parents' apartment.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.180]   And I was just talking to myself.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.980]   Is this fun?
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:28.780]   Is this fun?
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.460]   And I was like, this is so stupid.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:33.780]   Maybe before I was a Christian, I could have enjoyed this,
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.180]   but as a Christian, in the back of my mind,
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.780]   this is not right.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.620]   I don't want this.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.460]   I'm not even having fun.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.060]   This is dumb.
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:44.580]   And I remember, half drunk, sitting in that room,
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.220]   thinking I'd rather,
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.340]   I'd rather sit in the back of the seat.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.420]   Forget this revival, I'm gonna be used by God.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.420]   It's like, all that went out the door.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.900]   I'd rather sit quietly in the back,
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:01.300]   even if it's just an inch of progress a year.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.940]   That's better than this.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:06.660]   And so it was much different.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.940]   My first repentance was like, oh my gosh,
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.060]   I can't believe God is real, and he loves me,
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.820]   and I'm gonna tell the whole world about God.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.420]   And that was my first conversion.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.620]   But the second time I repented, it was just,
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:23.300]   my father's house, as a servant, is better than this.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:27.100]   See, it says in Luke chapter 15,
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.180]   when the son came, verse 21,
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.700]   son said to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven,
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.220]   "and in your sight I am no longer worthy
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.460]   "to be called your son.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:42.460]   "But," he was expecting his father to come out,
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:46.300]   and he said, "You, after what you've done,
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.580]   "everything you blew, the disgrace
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.180]   "that you brought to our home?"
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:54.360]   He says, "But," the father said to his slaves,
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.980]   "quickly, bring out the best robe, put it on him,
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.980]   "put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet,
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.040]   "and bring the fattened calf, kill it,
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.380]   "and let us eat and celebrate!
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.260]   "For this son of mine was dead,
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.680]   "and has come to life again.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.520]   "He was lost, and has been found,
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.260]   "and they began to celebrate."
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.900]   He was trying to tell the Pharisees and the scribes,
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.300]   "This is your heavenly father!
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:26.200]   "What you think heavenly father is, you've missed him.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.140]   "This is the heavenly father who is eagerly waiting
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:32.380]   "for sinners to repent and come,
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.860]   "that not only he will celebrate,
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.040]   "that they're gonna be celebrating for eternity
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.460]   "in Zion, this is who God is."
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:45.260]   See, all that you and I have experienced,
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:49.780]   all the joy that you and I have known as Christians,
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:52.060]   we're really meant to be hors d'oeuvres.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:54.760]   Right, you go to a wedding,
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:56.380]   and they'll present the hors d'oeuvres,
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:59.520]   and you don't go to the hors d'oeuvres and then go home.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.100]   Right, you get the hors d'oeuvres
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.260]   'cause it kinda whets your appetite and prepares,
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.620]   so you know, you go to some place,
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.560]   and the hors d'oeuvres are ridiculous.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.500]   Right, and you come, and you come,
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.620]   and say, "Oh my gosh."
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.300]   In fact, some of the people at church have pictures
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.900]   of me standing by the door waiting for hors d'oeuvres.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.940]   (congregation laughing)
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.340]   Right, you gotta stand in the right place
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.620]   'cause when they come out,
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.300]   you know, the hors d'oeuvres that aren't that popular
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.820]   will make its way around,
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:27.700]   but the good ones don't make it past 10, 15 feet, right?
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.100]   Jason knows what I'm talking about.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.820]   (laughing)
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.220]   I have a picture of me and him standing by the door.
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.500]   (congregation laughing)
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.220]   'Cause the hors d'oeuvres are to prepare us,
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:41.980]   and if the hors d'oeuvres are this good, what's inside?
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.420]   What's inside, right?
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:48.520]   That's what this means, the here and not yet.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.900]   That's what the word teleos means,
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.780]   is to be made whole, to bring to completion,
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.200]   that everything that he has shown us,
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.820]   everything he has taught us,
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:58.740]   is just to whet our appetite.
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:01.300]   So he who began a good work in you
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.060]   will carry it on to completion
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.540]   until the day of Christ when he comes.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:08.960]   He will bring to teleos what he has intended.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.900]   In 1 Corinthians 13, 9-12, it says,
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:15.780]   "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part,
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:17.940]   "but when the perfect comes," teleos comes,
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.740]   "the partial will be done away with."
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.860]   When I was a child, I used to speak like a child,
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:23.800]   think like a child, reason like a child.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.300]   When I became a man, I did away with childless things,
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.600]   for now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.340]   Now I know in part, but then I will know fully
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.000]   just as I also have been fully known.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.060]   I can't describe to you with words
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:42.000]   the day that I became a Christian.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.660]   Some of you are probably sick and tired of me
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.780]   to share my testimony,
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:50.500]   'cause you've heard it over 100 times.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.600]   I can tell it to you another 100 times.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:59.340]   It was the happiest day of my life.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.600]   An angry child became happy instantaneously.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.880]   Instantaneously.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.560]   I didn't have to get counseling,
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560]   I didn't have to get discipled.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.500]   I met Christ and everything changed.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.000]   Everything changed.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.300]   And to think,
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.480]   those were just hors d'oeuvres.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.720]   That when we get to heaven,
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.560]   this God who opened my eyes to see him,
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:32.620]   I'm gonna be in front of him face to face.
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.220]   And it's not gonna be temporary,
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.300]   it's gonna be forever.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:42.080]   That's why Jesus says he went to the cross
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.260]   because of the joy set before him.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:47.300]   Not because he was obligated,
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.500]   not because somebody was twisting his arms.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:52.380]   He said because of the joy set before him,
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.340]   he was able to endure the cross.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:57.860]   See, the moment we take our eyes
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.080]   off of what's coming,
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.980]   it just becomes the cross.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.240]   It just becomes suffering.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.880]   It just becomes obligation.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:13.020]   It isn't until we have firmly placed our hope in Christ.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.240]   That's what it says in Philippians 3, 12, 15.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.160]   Not that I've already obtained it
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.760]   or have already become perfect,
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.240]   but I press on so that I may lay hold of that
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.060]   for which also he laid hold of me.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.620]   He says he's pressing on
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:31.820]   because he wants what God has already given him,
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.820]   but he hasn't reached it yet, right?
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.420]   He hasn't been made perfect yet.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.740]   In 1 John 3, 2 to 3, it says,
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.300]   "Beloved, now we are children of God
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.760]   "and it has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.340]   "We know that when he appears, we will be like him
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.300]   "because we will see him just as he is.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:50.000]   "And everyone who has this hope fixed on him
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.100]   "purifies himself just as he is pure."
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.740]   He just described sanctification.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:58.160]   Sanctification isn't just hard work.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.260]   It isn't the right program.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.580]   It isn't the right organization.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.180]   It isn't meeting the right person.
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.440]   So he says sanctification is the individual
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.340]   who recognizes this hope in Christ.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:10.840]   And he who hopes in this Christ,
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.140]   he purifies himself.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.700]   Just as Jesus said,
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:18.940]   "He endured the cross because of the joy set before him."
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:23.100]   If we believe that true joy is coming to Christ,
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.940]   true life is coming to Christ.
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:29.720]   And that's why anything that gets in the way
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.120]   of tainting that,
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.980]   we don't want anything to do with.
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.480]   That's sanctification.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.900]   Not just hard work.
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.060]   Not just right organization.
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:42.260]   Not just right program.
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.620]   Do we believe this?
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.300]   Do we believe this?
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.980]   He who believes it, sets his hope on him,
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.040]   will purify himself as he is pure.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.620]   You know, some of you guys probably have
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.700]   different bucket lists, right?
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.100]   And I know some of you guys love to travel.
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.420]   I like traveling, but some of you guys are
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:05.540]   really like traveling.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.260]   And every once in a while I ask you like,
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.300]   "Hey, can you tell me if we go here what to do?"
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.300]   And then the itinerary you give.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.780]   Seven o'clock wake up, 7.05 brush your teeth,
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:17.420]   7.10 get breakfast, 7.15 get coffee.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.660]   It just, I don't wanna go to this vacation.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.940]   I'm tired looking at this itinerary.
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:22.780]   Right?
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.820]   That's a vacation.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:26.340]   You're supposed to go there and relax.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.940]   I'll wake up when I feel like waking up,
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.580]   and then if I'm hungry I'm gonna eat.
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.660]   And then if I'm bored I'm gonna go see something.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.100]   And then when I'm tired I'm gonna come home.
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.860]   I mean, this is worse than the job.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:40.900]   But because you love it, you love traveling
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.460]   to the point where you wanna go maximize
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.540]   the time that you have when you get there.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:52.540]   And you pour so much energy to maximize it, right?
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:54.060]   Why?
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.020]   Because it makes you happy to do that.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.940]   You put time and effort and energy and money
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.460]   because it brings joy.
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:06.580]   If we recognize the things that God has given us
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:11.300]   in eternity is so much more than anything else
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.820]   that we can experience here,
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:16.860]   how much more energy and time and effort
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.460]   should we be pouring into pursuing that?
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:24.780]   Let me close with this, Isaiah 25, six through eight.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:29.260]   The Lord of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.280]   for all peoples on this mountain,
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.500]   a banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.980]   and refined aged wine.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:39.540]   And on this mountain he will swallow up the covering
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.740]   which is over all peoples.
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.620]   Even the veil which is stretched over all nations,
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.460]   he will swallow up death for all time.
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:50.100]   And the Lord God will wipe tears away from all faces.
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.340]   And he will remove the reproach of his people
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:56.800]   from all the earth for the Lord has spoken, amen.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.060]   I pray that the promise of Zion
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.100]   will be so deeply embedded in us
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.180]   that what he started in us now
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:10.660]   will cause us to long for the day, right?
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.700]   Long for the day that we would also eagerly wait
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.160]   and be purified as a result.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.160]   Let's pray together.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.920]   (pages rustling)
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:25.020]   Lord, what an awesome God you are.
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:29.200]   Lord, you know our weakness.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:31.800]   You know how easily we get entangled and tempted
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.360]   by the things that are temporal.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.560]   We know, Father God, in our minds
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.740]   that all of these things are passing away.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.640]   And yet we are constantly concerned, worried.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.960]   Help us, Lord God.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.600]   We're helpless when we are away from you.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.160]   I pray that your word and your spirit
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.120]   would lead us, guide us, help us, Lord God,
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.500]   to know that true joy, true celebration
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.540]   is coming with Christ.
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.520]   That though our life is now hidden with Christ,
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.860]   help us, Lord God, to wait for him coming.
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:08.280]   And when he is glorified, that we will be glorified in him.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.560]   May your name be honored.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.940]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.280]   Why don't we all stand up for the closing praise?
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.320]   (gentle piano music)

[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:41.180]   Hebrews chapter four, eight through 11.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:44.520]   For if Joshua had given them rest,
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.540]   he would not have spoken of another day after that.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:50.760]   So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.600]   For the one who has entered his rest
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.600]   has himself also rested from his works as God did from his.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:01.480]   Therefore, let us be diligent to enter that rest
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.160]   so that no one will fall through the following
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.500]   of the same example of disobedience.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.400]   Lord, we pray that you would give us wisdom
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.920]   to apply your word in our life.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.600]   Help us, Lord, to have a clearer and greater vision
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.440]   of what is coming, that we would live the rest
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.640]   of our lives preparing Father God
