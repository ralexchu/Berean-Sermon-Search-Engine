[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.860]   Okay, so that main point is that God is God, there are no other gods.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.240]   We're not going to stray from that main point at all.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.040]   And so there's going to be five points.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.920]   For those of you who need everything kind of planned out in front of you, out of those
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.580]   five points, the first one is going to be the longest.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.600]   So halfway through the sermon, if you're kind of getting nervous that we're going a long
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960]   time, the last four will go a lot quicker.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.360]   The first one we're going to be spending a lot of time in there.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.900]   And so that first point is this though, that He is sovereign over kingdoms.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.900]   That's our first point.
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.440]   He is sovereign over kingdoms.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.280]   Now as we look at the text in Isaiah, what we see is that there's a lot of historical
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.760]   things going on.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.520]   And so there's Israel, and Israel has been at this point in history separated from North
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.720]   and South.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.240]   So the Northern Kingdom is called Israel and the Southern Kingdom is called Judah.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.240]   There's 10 tribes up North, 2 tribes down South.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:07.600]   As you see this, we can see through the unfurling message of scripture that God has been sovereignly
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.960]   working in His people, Israel.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.160]   He's been moving them, He's been kind of taking them in and out, and a lot of it had to do
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.120]   with their obedience to Him, their obedience to His covenant promises.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.720]   So if you're familiar with Leviticus chapter 26 or Deuteronomy chapter 28, we see a lot
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   of that.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.080]   He says, "If you obey my commands, if you love me, if you follow after me, then I'll
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.200]   bring to you prosperity and success."
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.600]   He says, "However, if you disobey, if you are not faithful to me, if you are adulterous
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   against me, then you will find my calamity."
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.880]   And so that's how it's been.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.920]   He's been sovereignly working in His people, in His nation.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.640]   So specifically in this time of Isaiah, we find that the tribes have already split.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.120]   Now in this split, what we see, yes, is Israel's unfaithfulness.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.400]   That's why there's a split with the 10 and the 2.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.960]   What we also see in the midst of this historical fact, though, is that God's preserving, gracious,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.760]   and merciful hand is continuing.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.640]   From the time man falls, God has been promising over and over again that a Messiah is going
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.880]   to come, that He is going to send the anointed, chosen one to save His people.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.320]   And with that, Isaiah was written in 740 BC.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.940]   It was written to the southern kingdom.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.160]   And in the middle of this preaching that Isaiah does, because it does encompass a few decades,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.560]   in the middle of his preaching, what he's saying is, "The northern kingdom is going
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   to fall."
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.280]   And he tells this to the southern kingdom.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.440]   "A foreign nation is going to come and take you over, and that foreign nation is going
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.880]   to be Assyria."
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.720]   And the northern kingdom was meant to be a case study to the southern kingdom.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.200]   That the southern kingdom is going to see the northern kingdom fall, see God's sovereign
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.720]   hand at work, that if we are unfaithful to God's covenant promise, then He will do,
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.360]   sovereignly, according to what He sees fit.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.840]   Now the reason why we're talking about this is because we see God's sovereignty clearly
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.920]   at work with Israel.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.040]   But in many of the pages of Isaiah, we also see God's sovereignty, God's sovereign
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.120]   hand at work in foreign nations.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.040]   In 722 BC, so Isaiah was probably written somewhere around 740, and it spans through
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.920]   the captivity of the northern kingdom.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.600]   But in 722 BC, the northern kingdom finally falls to Assyria.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.560]   And the southern kingdom witnesses this.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.800]   Assyria becomes one of the many foreign nations that God uses to sovereignly bring justice,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.280]   a judgment against Israel.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.760]   But after Assyria, there comes another country, another nation called Babylon.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.560]   And after Babylon, another one called Persia.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.960]   Now Persia is very interesting.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.560]   There's Assyria and Babylon are used to enact God's judgment and justice against Israel
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.680]   for breaking His covenant promise.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.760]   But Persia comes in and does something very differently.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.100]   God uses Persia to bring Israel back into the promised land, that He might continue
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.100]   to be faithful with them.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.160]   Why are we talking about this?
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.800]   Well, if you look at Isaiah chapter 45 verses one through three, there's a man that comes
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.680]   out by the name of Cyrus.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.520]   It says this in verse one, "Thus says the Lord to Cyrus, his anointed," that's a very
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.780]   interesting word used there, "whom I have taken by the right hand to subdue nations
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.460]   before him and to loose the loins of kings, to open doors before him so that gates will
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.720]   not be shut.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.720]   I will go before you and make the rough places smooth.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.160]   I will shatter the doors of bronze and cut through their iron bars.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.480]   I will give you the treasures of darkness and hidden wealth of secret places so that
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.800]   you may know that it is I, the Lord, the God of Israel, who calls you by your name."
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.760]   Again, putting ourselves in the position of during the time of Isaiah, the southern kingdom,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.480]   at 700 BC-ish, they are told that Assyria is going to come and conquer, that God will
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.200]   use Assyria in His sovereignty to conquer the northern kingdom.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.960]   And then in the midst of Isaiah, they're also shown that Babylon will come in and take over
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.140]   the southern kingdom if they continue to remain unfaithful.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.840]   But here, Persia is 200 years in the future, and by name, this man by the name of King
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.040]   Cyrus is mentioned here, that the Lord is going to use Cyrus as His anointed one, that
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.740]   He is going to sovereignly use Cyrus and this country of Persia to enact His sovereign purpose
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.280]   and will, His desires.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.600]   The reason why we're talking about all this is to show that God is ultimately sovereign
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.680]   over all kingdoms, all nations.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.280]   And this is a very important point.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   We understand that God is sovereign over Israel.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   That's easy.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.760]   And we see it clearly written.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.400]   He causes Israel to succeed, He causes Israel to fail.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.800]   We see kings come up and they buck against the Lord and they rebel against Him and He
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.360]   just drops them down.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.720]   So over and over and over, we can see God just rising and lowering, rising and lowering.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.200]   But also, what I want to mention is that God is sovereign over all these other kingdoms.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.920]   God is sovereign over every kingdom in the world, every nation.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:39.020]   Not a single country is outside of God's sovereign hand, rule and control.
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.860]   God is the one who causes nations to succeed.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.580]   God is the one who causes nations to fall.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.860]   I'm sure that Assyria and all her kings, and if you think about kind of just the short
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.420]   timeline Babylon and all her kings, and Persia and all her kings, they all had their own
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.420]   endeavors.
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.860]   They all had their own desires and ambitions, their goals for where they wanted their country
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:09.340]   to go, that they wanted power, they wanted land, they wanted rule and prestige and fame.
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.340]   They wanted prosperity for their people.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.900]   What they don't realize is that none of it comes to fruition outside of God's sovereign
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.900]   hand.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:26.900]   Israel, yes, is under God's sovereign control, but every other nation works under His power,
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.140]   His control, His will, and His timing, and all of this is in accordance to His perfect
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.420]   sight over everything.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.380]   What does it mean to be sovereign?
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.760]   We throw around that term a lot, and I think many times we throw it around very lightly,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.740]   that God is sovereign.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.060]   We believe it, we say amen to that, we will mention it all the time.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.740]   What does it mean?
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.580]   As an adjective, sovereign is to possess supreme or ultimate power.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.580]   That's used as an adjective.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.900]   It could also be used as a noun, that the sovereign, He is the sovereign.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.380]   That is that God is the supreme ruler.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.940]   He has ultimate authority in His hands.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.140]   He is the sovereign one.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:21.100]   He will do and He can do according to His will, and nothing falls outside of His will.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.700]   He is the sovereign one.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:30.740]   When we see kings in power, when we see presidents and prime ministers and governments and authorities,
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.300]   they all kneel before the sovereign one.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.580]   God is sovereign.
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:46.660]   The one who uses all things to His purposes, goals, and will, every single king, every
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.340]   single nation bends to His sovereign control.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.140]   No one can withstand Him.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.900]   These kings, these nations might have their own ambitions.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:03.540]   They might think that they're bucking against God's sovereign will, but they're not.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.660]   In Colossians 1.15, it talks of Jesus.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:14.220]   It says that Jesus, He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.340]   For by Him, all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.340]   Here it is.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:27.700]   Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.580]   Him and for Him.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.620]   Those words, I hope, are sticking with you.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:43.180]   Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities were created through Him and for
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.180]   Him.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.660]   In Ephesians 1.20, that He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.700]   Him at His right hand in the heavenly places.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.900]   It's talking of Christ.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.500]   This is what God does for Christ.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.460]   Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and above every name that is
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.180]   named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:10.340]   And He put all things under His feet and gave Him as head over all things to the church,
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:17.020]   which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.020]   This is the truth.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:23.100]   It can't be clearer than this.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:33.060]   All rule, all authority, power, dominion falls under the feet of Christ.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.900]   Let's try to picture this a little more.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:47.900]   Psalms 2, Psalm 2, verse 1-6 says, "Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.580]   The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together."
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.100]   See this is an image of all these kings and rulers coming together and they're like counseling
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.940]   each other.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.900]   And they're talking with each other.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.780]   And they're setting themselves together, combining together to rebel against the Lord.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.900]   To me it kind of sounds like Babel, the Tower of Babel.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:19.820]   But in verse 2, continuing, "And the rulers take counsel together against the Lord, against
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:25.700]   God Himself, against His anointed."
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.540]   And this is what they say, "Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.540]   us."
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:40.940]   They're saying, "Under the sovereign God, we will come together, we will take counsel
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.060]   together.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.340]   Let us burst our bonds aside.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.420]   Let us burst it apart.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.220]   We will not follow under His rule any longer.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:56.340]   We will follow under our own rule, our own law, under our own desires, our own ambitions.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.820]   We will say what we will do.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.400]   We will say what we will not do.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.720]   We will say what is right.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.900]   We will say what is wrong.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.700]   I am going to live in accordance to what I want to do."
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:14.660]   And then in verse 4, you see all of these people coming together.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.860]   In verse 4, "There's God sitting in His throne.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.420]   He who sits in the heavens laughs.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.500]   The Lord holds them in derision.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   Then He will speak to them in His wrath and terrify them in His fury, saying, 'As for
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.340]   me, I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill.'"
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:40.300]   When I first read this, I think, "Man, it kind of sounds rude, you know?
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.580]   Like, with God laughing."
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:49.300]   I think that the picture that's being shown here is just like, it's just, you're like,
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.900]   "God looking at all these kings coming together, like little ants coming together, saying,
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.900]   'We will overthrow.'"
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:00.340]   Like, you can't help but laugh.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:07.140]   It's just like, dude, you know, it's like, if you imagine like this little toddler walking
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:12.580]   up to the side of a mountain and just endeavoring, "I am going to move this mountain."
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.940]   And he pushes with all his might, and pushes and pushes.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:20.540]   You're sitting there, you're looking, and you're like, you laugh.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:29.740]   It says here that God sits in heaven and He laughs at these nations that are bucking under
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.300]   His rule.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.700]   It's not only kingdoms, but all that we see in the world, God is in complete and perfect
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.940]   control of everything.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.140]   The nations are raging today.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.100]   But it's not just the nations.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.660]   We rage from the moment you and I are born.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.940]   We rage.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.560]   This is what we say.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.980]   Let us burst our bonds.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:04.860]   Everything in our sinful heart says, "I will not kneel before Him as my God."
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:12.020]   As soon as we come alive, we say, "I am God."
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.500]   And many times we take counsel together, and we come together, and we say, "Let's do this
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.500]   together."
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:24.460]   That's how nations happen.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.460]   Don't we do this?
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.620]   Don't we buck against God's sovereignty?
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.940]   In our own little minute lives, we buck against it, and we fight against it, and we rebel
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.740]   against it.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.820]   We assert our own sovereignty.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:45.980]   The nations are just a ballooned example of what's going on in our individual little hearts.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.660]   It starts in the individual's heart.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.480]   The individual asserts his own will.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.340]   The individual says that he will live what he wants to live for.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.060]   The individual says that he will live according to his own purposes.
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:03.500]   The individual says, "I will erect my kingdom in my life.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.100]   I will do what I want to do.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.700]   I will make my name great.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.860]   I will bring pleasure to myself."
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.460]   James chapter four, verse 13 then says, "Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:21.000]   go to such and such a city and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.'"
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.180]   This is where God kind of laughs.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:31.220]   Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:39.140]   You're just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanish away.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.260]   What do you think you can do?
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:49.460]   Do you have sovereign control over any decision that you make in your life?
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.540]   Restore sovereignty to where it belongs.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.920]   Verse 15, "Instead you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.920]   or that.'"
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.940]   As it is, you boast in your arrogance.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.780]   All such boasting is evil.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.460]   It's evil.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.260]   Saying I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, I purpose this, I endeavor in this
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.840]   without God in it, it's evil.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.300]   Why is it evil?
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.420]   It's evil because you are saying God is not God.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.140]   You are saying I am God.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:28.700]   You are saying my purposes, my kingdoms do come.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.820]   What is it that we actually think we can do?
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.380]   What is it that we actually think we can accomplish with our hands?
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.260]   In today's culture, they say you can make a difference.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.100]   The smallest voice matters.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.020]   I understand what's being said.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.160]   But to what extent?
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.000]   We come to realize that all of it falls under the power and rule of the sovereign one's
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.120]   ultimate will.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.300]   We can't even keep ourselves alive.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:08.980]   Try as we might with all our technology, we can't stop a disease from killing us.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.060]   We can't control the stock market.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:17.300]   We can't make mother nature move in accordance to what we want.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.740]   I can't even get my two-year-old to obey me.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.280]   He won't do what I say.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.100]   What do we think we can do?
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:34.220]   We wake up, from the moment we wake up, we're planning and we're endeavoring.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.900]   The nation's raging is a ballooned up example of this, that all these individual hearts
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.400]   that try to live out their own existence according to their terms, try to assert their own will
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.340]   and sovereignty to accomplish what they desire.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:55.220]   It says in Psalm 127 verse 1 and 2, "Unless the Lord builds the house, unless the Lord
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:00.180]   builds it, they labor in vain who build it.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:06.060]   Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain."
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.840]   It is vain for you to rise up early.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.580]   It is vain for you to retire late.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.520]   It is vain for you to eat the bread of painful labors.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.640]   It is vain for you, for he gives to his beloved even in his sleep.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.060]   God is the one who gives and takes away.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:27.780]   He is the one who brings up and establishes and he brings everything down into calamity.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.740]   He's the only one and that's our first point.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.860]   He is sovereign over kingdoms.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.220]   Our second point is that he is the creator of the world and all that is in it.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:44.060]   So remember, the main point is, God is God.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.620]   So this point number two is, he is the creator of the world.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.420]   He is the creator.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.560]   No one else can claim that title.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.140]   There was only one who created all things that we see and from everything that we see,
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.820]   it just comes under what he made.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:09.020]   So Isaiah is continuing to speak to the southern kingdom and these are the ones, again, he's
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.340]   continuing to preserve and choose his people.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:21.500]   The ones who are not just chosen of God but now what they're doing is they are kind of,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.540]   even after the northern kingdom falls, the southern kingdom, if you're familiar with
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.380]   the kings and the Samuels and the Chronicles, as you see it playing out, even the southern
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.660]   kingdom eventually ends up falling.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.580]   These are the ones, he's talking to the ones here who continue to live out their own existence.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.700]   He's talking to the southern kingdom and he's saying, "Do you not understand that God is
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.140]   God?
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.100]   Don't you see what's happening to the northern kingdom?
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.940]   Don't you see what's going to happen to you?"
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.940]   In this context, he reminds them, God is God, yes, he is sovereign, yes.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.220]   Remember that he is also the creator.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.220]   Verses seven through eight in chapter 45 says this, "The one forming light and creating
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:16.140]   darkness, causing well-being and creating calamity, I am the Lord who does all these.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.300]   Drip down, O heavens, from above and let the clouds pour down righteousness.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:25.180]   Let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit and righteousness spring up with it.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.700]   I, the Lord, have created it."
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:36.220]   Jumping to verse 11 and 12, "Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel and his maker."
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.380]   Every time titles are used, you have to just stop and look.
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.580]   Verse 11 again, "Thus says the Lord, he is the Holy, set-apart One, the One unlike any
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.660]   other of Israel and the Maker of Israel, the Creator.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.460]   He says, 'Ask me about the things to come concerning my sons and you shall commit to
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.620]   me the work of my hands.'
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.220]   It is I who made the earth and created man upon it.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.020]   I stretched out the heavens with my hands and I ordained all their hosts."
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:10.700]   See, God made the world and he made the world with purpose.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.840]   He made it good.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.540]   The purpose is not to accomplish and pursue as creation.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:27.620]   God's created work is not to go off and live out according to their own purposes and wills.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.220]   When God looks at creation and says it's good, is that everything in creation understands
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.580]   that there is creator and there is purpose in it and the purpose is in accordance to
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.220]   the creator's purpose.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:47.220]   Not for the creation to go out and live in accordance to their own purpose.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:53.580]   Our purpose as creation is not to accomplish and pursue our own little heart's desires.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:22:00.860]   To purchase the newest phones and cars, biggest houses, go after the best educations.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:08.860]   Only pursue our own kingdoms, our own wills, to build up our own name and our own prestige.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.700]   Very much like what happened at the Tower of Babel.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.700]   We were created by the creator with a purpose.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:25.620]   To worship God, to love him, to be loved by him, to be in a perfect relationship with him.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.420]   Everything just makes sense in that schema.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.900]   Point two, he's God.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.240]   He is the creator of the world and all that is in it.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.480]   Point three, then there are no other gods.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.900]   There are no other gods.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.580]   That seems like a pointless statement.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.900]   There are no other gods, of course.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.900]   God is God.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.780]   There are no other gods.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.020]   In Deuteronomy 6, there's this thing, it's called the Shema.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.180]   This was the center point of Jewish worship.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.660]   Every morning and every night, they would say the Shema.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.860]   It was a phrase.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.860]   This phrase went like this, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.340]   The Lord is one."
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.800]   In the morning, they would wake up and say that.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.500]   Every single person, they would say that.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.860]   "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God."
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.060]   Why do you have to say that?
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.900]   The Lord is our God.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.380]   Yeah, of course, he's our God.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.820]   At night, "The Lord is our God."
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.380]   Wake up the next morning, "The Lord is our God."
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.620]   Go to sleep again, "The Lord is our God."
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.420]   The Lord is one.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.940]   One.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.620]   There are no other gods.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:54.900]   There is no Baal, there is no Moloch, there is no Ammon or Dagon.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.260]   These were idols set up by the nations.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.280]   Remember, it begins in the individual heart.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.580]   There might be the collective idol that we set up as a culture, as a society.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.580]   It's all the same.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.500]   It's all anti-God.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.060]   All of creation bucking against the fact that he is God.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.000]   It's all rebellion against him.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.220]   It's all perversion of what was meant for good.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.020]   When we look at idols, this is kind of a significant chunk of text.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.220]   I'm going to ask you, you do have to engage with this text.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.980]   It's a story and it's kind of satire-like, starting Isaiah 44.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.220]   I didn't realize it was so small.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.420]   In verse 12, if you can't see it, then you could listen.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:47.240]   "The man shapes iron into a cutting tool and does his work over the coals, fashioning
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.620]   it with hammers and working it with a strong arm.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.620]   He also gets hungry and his strength fails.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.380]   He drinks no water and becomes weary."
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:00.020]   This is talking about this man who's making an idol.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.880]   "Another shapes wood.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.620]   He extends a measuring line.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.320]   He outlines it with red chalk.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.620]   He works it with planes and outlines it with a compass.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:14.340]   He makes it like the form of a man, like the beauty of man, so that it may sit in a house.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:20.060]   Surely he cuts cedars for himself and he takes a cypress or an oak and he raises it for himself
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.460]   among the trees of the forest.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.420]   He plants a fir and the rain makes it grow.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:30.460]   Then it becomes something for a man to burn, so he takes one of them and warms himself.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.860]   He also makes a fire to bake bread."
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.260]   Here it is.
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:39.460]   He also makes a god and worships it.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.860]   He makes it a graven image and falls down before it.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.140]   Look at the absurdity of this.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.140]   Verse 16.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.380]   "Half of it he burns in the fire.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.820]   Over this half he eats meat as he roasts, roasts and is satisfied.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.060]   He also warms himself in front of this fire and says, 'Aha, I am warm.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.060]   I have seen the fire.'
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:04.980]   But the rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.900]   He falls down before it and worships.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.260]   He also prays to it and says, 'Deliver me, for you are my god.'
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.940]   They do not know, nor do they understand, for he has smeared over their eyes that they
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.900]   cannot see and their hearts that they cannot comprehend.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.340]   No one recalls, nor is there knowledge or understanding to say, 'I have burned half
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.300]   of it in the fire and also have baked bread over its coals.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.020]   I roast meat and eat it.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.820]   Then I make the rest of it into an abomination.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:34.220]   I fall down before a block of wood.'
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.220]   He feeds on ashes.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.260]   His deceived heart has turned him aside and he cannot deliver himself, nor say, 'Is there
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.260]   not a lie in my right hand?'"
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:47.900]   And yet, when we idolize things of this world, this is exactly what we're doing.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:53.700]   We are celebrating and worship something as God when they are but creation.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.940]   Figments of the imagination.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.920]   There are no other gods.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.860]   This is the God that society wrecks.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.620]   They are not real.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.620]   That's what the Shema was.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.460]   "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.340]   The Lord is one."
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.020]   This was a story of a man worshiping an idol.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:26.860]   But a few chapters later in 47, Isaiah swings around and tells us the end of this.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.460]   So Isaiah 47, verse 8 through 11.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.460]   This is a shorter text.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.540]   It says, "Now then, hear this, you sensual one."
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.300]   That's the ones who go after your own sensual lusts.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:44.700]   He says, "Who dwells securely, who says in your heart, 'I am, and there is no one besides
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.820]   me.'
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.340]   I will not sit as a widow, nor know loss of children."
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.660]   Man, what a statement.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.460]   This man who sits there and says, "I am."
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.980]   Wow.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.660]   Actually we're not going to go into it, but I'm sure that's triggering in you a memory
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.660]   of a name.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:07.300]   "I am, and there is no one besides me."
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.180]   Verse 9, "But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day, loss of children
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.180]   and widowhood.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.200]   They will come on you in full measure in spite of your many sorceries, in spite of the great
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.960]   power of your spells.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.260]   You felt secure in your wickedness and said, 'No one sees me.'
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.540]   Your wisdom and your knowledge, they have deluded you.
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:28.460]   For you have said in your heart, 'I am, and there is no one besides me.'
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.900]   Great evil will come on you, which you will not know how to charm away.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.500]   And disaster will fall on you, for which you cannot atone.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.980]   And destruction about which you do not know will come on you suddenly."
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.620]   Ultimately though, this is us, isn't it?
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.700]   Our casting ourselves before idols, worshipping idols, is actually us worshipping ourselves,
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.620]   isn't it?
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.540]   Because we worship our desires.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:03.300]   And so we worship idols only because they promise to give us our desires.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:09.580]   We worship them as gods, but actually we are worshipping ourselves.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:13.580]   Back then, people worshipped false gods because they promised personal success.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:19.460]   That is to bring rain upon the crops, to increase the yield of their land, to end the famine
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:26.580]   or the plague, to give pleasure to people.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.540]   People would even create gods just so that they could live out their pleasures.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.420]   Their own sexual perversions and twisted desires was very common in the form of temple prostitutes
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.420]   and orgies.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:40.700]   Like there were no bounds to it.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.220]   And today though, it's still that.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:49.800]   People still worship sensually.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.540]   If I worship this god, will I ultimately get what I want?
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.540]   That's still today.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.980]   See, we look at something called the prosperity gospel.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.140]   Prosperity gospel is all of that, right?
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:07.020]   I will worship the god of the Bible, Yahweh, the same one, same Bible that we read.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:13.940]   I will worship if he promises me prosperity and wealth.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.100]   And so it looks like they're worshipping the god of the Bible, because they're using our
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.100]   scripture, but they might as well be worshipping a golden calf.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.860]   Notice that in the story of the golden calf.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.860]   Aaron says this.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.580]   In Exodus chapter 32, verse 2.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.820]   Now remember, Moses went up this mountain.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.260]   He's been gone for a long time.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.500]   The people of Israel are waiting for him, and now they're terrified.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.380]   They think he's dead.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.820]   And so they're like, what are we going to do?
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.740]   So Aaron said to them, tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.900]   sons and your daughters, and bring them to me.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.820]   And then all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears and brought
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.580]   them to Aaron.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.460]   He took this from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.900]   molten calf.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.500]   Up to here, this is outrageous, but it makes sense.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:02.060]   They created a god.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.780]   Here is the twistedness of this.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:10.900]   And they said, this molten calf that they just created, they said, this is your god,
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.900]   oh Israel.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:22.100]   Heavenly Father, I pray that we truly would kneel before you.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.860]   You are our Lord, our God, and our maker.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.060]   You are the creator of all things, and you alone sustain all things.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.340]   Father, we know this.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.780]   You are holy and set apart.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.980]   You are second to none.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.180]   You are so different.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.060]   Father, you alone take that mantle.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:49.660]   God, thank you for being God.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:55.340]   And Father, I pray that we would be a church with such a simple truth, even when we start
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:32:01.540]   our prayers, dear God, that everything in our prayers would align with that.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.740]   God, you're God.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.780]   I'm not God.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.800]   So Father, help us because our hearts are so fickle and prone to wander.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.900]   We need your help to be a church that does this.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.660]   We pray God for conviction and boldness to be able to live in accordance to what we proclaim
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.660]   and believe.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.100]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.260]   Would you take a moment to pray on your own?
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.260]   Amen.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   Amen.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.260]   Amen.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:25.260]   Amen.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:25.760]   Amen.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.260]   Amen.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:27.760]   Amen.
