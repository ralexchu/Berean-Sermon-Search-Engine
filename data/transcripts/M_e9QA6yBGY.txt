[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:04.940]   - All right, good morning.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.940]   Welcome to Bruin Community Church.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.700]   Let me begin by welcoming those who are coming into town
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.100]   because of the school starting.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.380]   I know this is a welcome week.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.060]   And so we have a welcome table stationed outside.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.700]   As you were coming in, you probably saw a canopy
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.660]   and a bunch of tables that are set up.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.140]   Especially if you are coming in
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.380]   and you want some information about our college department,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.060]   meet some of our staff here.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.600]   If you go to that table outside,
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.180]   they'll give you all the information that you need
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.260]   and give you the various schedules,
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.180]   things that are going on.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.300]   There's a lot of stuff going on,
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.320]   especially with the college ministry this week.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.380]   So please go to that table
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.500]   and they'll give you the information that you need.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.100]   Our membership class, our next round of membership class
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   is starting on September 29th, which is next Sunday at 9.30.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.380]   It's an eight-week course.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.880]   And if you desire to be a member of the church,
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.180]   please sign up for that.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.020]   And they'll give you directions on what's gonna happen.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.700]   Again, this is happening during this service at 9.30
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.160]   across the courtyard in our youth group room, okay?
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.660]   So please sign up for that if you are planning to do that.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.660]   And then our regional Thanksgiving dinner,
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.700]   they have about 25 people who have already signed up.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.180]   They said they need another about 20 to 25 people
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.020]   to sign up.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.260]   If you are interested in hosting
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.060]   then serving the church in that way,
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.300]   there is a table outside.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.140]   And again, this is not for the regular sign up
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.780]   for just to participate.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.460]   But if you're willing to host
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.160]   and you can fit maybe about 20, 25 people in your house,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   that's happening again on November 24th at 5 p.m.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.740]   But if you're able to host and you're willing to do that,
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.460]   that sign up is on the courtyard.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.180]   As you're going out, you'll meet the table
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.780]   and you can sign up there, okay?
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.060]   If you are at the age of 50 or over,
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.980]   okay, so part of the Jubilee ministry,
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.700]   on October 12th at 8.30, which is a Saturday in the cafe,
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.340]   we're gonna be having a prayer breakfast.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.820]   So all those who are 50 and over,
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.260]   part of the Jubilee ministry.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.900]   And a fee for that is gonna be $10 for breakfast.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.800]   So please sign up for that as well.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.740]   And then lastly, our Volunteers for Reformation Night,
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.460]   which is happening on October 31st at 4.30 p.m.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.420]   So if you're willing to come and set up
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.500]   or even help clean up or run some of the games,
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.340]   please sign up.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.980]   And I think that sign up for that
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.460]   is also at the table outside.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.340]   So if you go outside and just let them know
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.960]   that you wanna volunteer, they'll give you directions
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.220]   and the meetings that are gonna come from that, okay?
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.300]   All right, I think that's all we have for this morning.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.900]   Let me pray for us and give you an opportunity
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.860]   to give online.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.220]   And again, if you brought a physical offering,
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.140]   we have a box in the back on the way out.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.060]   You can visit that box on the way out, all right?
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.020]   Let me pray for us.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.700]   Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.700]   We pray, Father God, that we would never give into
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.180]   just a routine or a habit,
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.580]   but that the worship that we give you from our hearts
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.780]   will be an overflow of the great work
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.260]   that you are doing in us.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.020]   Help us to recognize what it is
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.260]   that we have been given in Christ,
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.320]   that our worship truly would be genuine,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.800]   an overflow of gratitude.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.100]   I pray this morning that you would help us
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.860]   not to be entangled with the things of this world,
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.260]   whatever we have brought into this room,
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.920]   that you would help us to focus our attention
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.820]   on Christ and his word.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.860]   And I pray that even in this giving,
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.220]   that we would give as an act of worship
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.260]   and maybe multiply 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.660]   for the sake of your name.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.500]   (gentle piano music)
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.420]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.340]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.260]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.860]   - Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.700]   just to greet the neighbors around us.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.860]   (audience chattering)

[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.260]   - And then, you may be seated.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:50.540]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter nine.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:57.900]   We'll be reading from verse 20, verse 18 to verse 27.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.860]   Okay, if I can make a request, and as I've mentioned before,
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.220]   you know, our, this service is starting to get a little bit crowded.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.100]   One, if you are planning to keep coming here to this service,
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.420]   one, if you can do us a favor to sit up way up in the front,
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.580]   so that the people who are coming late won't have to walk all the way to the front.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.540]   So if you are coming in to sit,
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.260]   instead of sitting, you know, a little bit away from the front,
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.180]   if you can pack the front first,
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.780]   it'll help us to manage the number of people that are coming.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.060]   Then two, if you're able to go to the first service,
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.180]   or even the third service,
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.340]   but prefer the first service at eight o'clock,
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.140]   we ask you to transition to the first service if can,
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.140]   again, to make room for what's going on.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.580]   One, obviously we need more room here for the elementary department,
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.220]   the SEEDS department, the parking issue we need to deal with.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.580]   And so if you're able to do that,
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.460]   I know many of you can't because you're serving or you're doing something,
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.540]   and obviously we're not saying that, like, not to come to this service,
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.060]   but if it's possible to go to first service,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.220]   go to first service or third service.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.860]   And at the minimum, if you are coming to the service
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.620]   is to come all the way to the front, okay?
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.780]   So that we can make more room for people who are coming a little bit later, all right?
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.940]   All right, we'll be looking at Luke chapter 9,
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.220]   verse 18 out of the NSV, all the way through verse 27.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:23.900]   "And it happened that while he was praying alone,
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.700]   the disciples were with him, and he questioned them, saying,
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.940]   'Who do the people say that I am?'
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.300]   They answered and said, 'John the Baptist, and others say Elijah,
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.420]   but others that one of the prophets of old has risen again.'
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.460]   And he said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?'
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.780]   And Peter answered and said, 'The Christ of God.'
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.700]   But he warned them and instructed them not to tell this to anyone,
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.700]   saying, 'The Son of Man must suffer many things
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.740]   and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.620]   and be killed and be raised up on the third day.'
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.900]   And he was saying to them all, 'If anyone wishes to come after me,
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.100]   he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.220]   For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.620]   but whoever loses his life for my sake, he is the one who will save it.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.180]   For what does a man profit if he gains the whole world
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.780]   and loses or forfeits himself?
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.500]   For whoever is ashamed of me and my words,
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.780]   the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory,
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.580]   in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.420]   But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.460]   who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.'"
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:26.940]   Let's pray.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.220]   Father, we thank you so much for this morning,
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.460]   the privilege that we have to come and worship you.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.620]   I pray that our worship that we give you,
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.980]   again, would not simply be out of habit
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.540]   or the culture that we have accepted,
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.860]   but that each Sunday we come,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.420]   that we come to give you the worship that you deserve.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.900]   We pray that your word would go forth
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.780]   and will not return until it has accomplished
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.980]   what you have ordained it for.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.780]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.360]   Amen.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:01.580]   All right, so to introduce this morning's text,
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.180]   I want you guys to kind of get a feel of what's happening here
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.580]   as Jesus is confirming for them his identity, okay?
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.340]   If I asked you, Trump is, right?
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.700]   Donald Trump is.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.980]   And what is your opinion of him, right?
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.100]   People get nervous already.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.580]   People get nervous already, right?
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.300]   Because at least in my lifetime,
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.940]   I've never seen anybody who was so polarizing.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.540]   We have opinions of him,
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.100]   and some people say that if he gets elected,
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.060]   he's going to save the world.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.540]   And then you have some people say he's a next coming Hitler,
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.140]   so he needs to be assassinated.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.820]   And people are saying that his two assassination attempts,
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.620]   you know, too bad it didn't work.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.780]   And so it's almost like if you mention anything
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.540]   about Donald Trump that it's going to cause controversy.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.140]   So you have to be cautious who you say what in front of who, right?
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.940]   Now, I'm saying all of this not to stir you up
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.340]   about Donald Trump this morning, right?
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.980]   But one, whatever opinion that you have,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.460]   I want to ask you, how did you come to that conclusion, right?
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.860]   Because it is so polarizing,
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.060]   a lot of the information that's coming through to say,
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.980]   well, he did this and he said this.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.620]   How did you get that information?
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.540]   And how do you trust that information?
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.660]   Was that true?
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.620]   Did he actually say that?
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.940]   Did it come through a filter of somebody
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.100]   who wanted to make sure that he was seen a certain way?
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.340]   So depending on where you get your information,
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.540]   how you got your information,
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.860]   you're going to have very differing opinions
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.020]   because none of us know him personally.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.180]   You don't have any personal experience with him.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.300]   So if you are listening to whatever information,
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.660]   whatever website, right?
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.820]   Whatever news channels that you're getting from,
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.460]   you either say you trust that or don't trust that.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.100]   But how did you come to that conclusion?
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.180]   And we need to be careful,
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.660]   especially now in the age of information
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:04.780]   where even just a formula of if you watch certain videos
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.060]   or you read certain articles,
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.140]   that leaning article is just constantly being fed.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.620]   And so part of the reason why our society
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.220]   is becoming more and more polarizing
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.780]   is because the information that we're getting
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.100]   is very deliberate and targeted.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:24.300]   Even Google search, there's a very particular angle
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.220]   that you're going to find with a chat GPT.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.620]   If you ask any questions, who created that?
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.180]   Who's allowing the information to come through?
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.220]   So again, we live in an age
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.940]   where whatever opinion that you may have of him,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.140]   we need to be very vigilant in asking,
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.220]   how did I come to this conclusion?
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.500]   And it is foolish to just simply say,
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.740]   everything I know is true and everything they know is dumb.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.340]   We have to be careful.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.100]   And I say all of this,
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.180]   not simply because I wanted to talk about Donald Trump.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.660]   I wanted you to get a sense emotionally
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.340]   what it was like in the first century
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.180]   when the name Jesus Christ came up.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.900]   Because the opinion of this man was so polarizing.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.300]   Some were ready to forcefully make him king,
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.540]   especially after the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.180]   He gave his credential of who he was.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.740]   And so people are beginning to come to the conclusion,
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.180]   he must be the Christ.
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.540]   And then there's a group of people who said,
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.300]   if he does it, if we don't get rid of this guy,
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.500]   he's going to ruin our nation.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:34.300]   And so even though he gave plenty of evidence,
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.620]   people came to the conclusion that must be demonic
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.780]   because clearly miracles are happening.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.380]   And since we've concluded that he is not from God
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.860]   and there's some supernatural power in him,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.140]   it must be demonic power.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.180]   So even though he raised Lazarus from the dead,
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.260]   the end conclusion was he needs to die
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.660]   in order to save our nation.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:58.140]   It is in that context that Jesus is asking this question,
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.820]   who do people say that I am?
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.780]   But ultimately, the real question is,
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.060]   who do you say that I am?
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.540]   And how did you come to that conclusion?
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.060]   Now, as a Christian,
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.460]   he lays out three things in this text that I want to cover.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.660]   And first one I'm going to cover today
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.420]   and the next two, hopefully I can cover next week.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.420]   But the cost of discipleship,
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.900]   what does it mean to be a follower of Jesus Christ?
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.300]   That we live in a culture
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.620]   where because we live in a post-Christian culture,
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.780]   many of you came from Christian homes,
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.820]   maybe parents are Christian,
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.340]   maybe there's a pastor or an elder or deacon in your family,
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.740]   maybe you're second, third, fourth generation Christian.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.100]   And maybe some of you were raised in a home
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.340]   where you can't remember when you didn't go to church.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.180]   And because we live in a post-Christian culture,
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.020]   there's a confusion as to what does it mean
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.700]   to be a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.980]   Well, if I go to church, if I make these confessions,
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.220]   if I do certain things, if I was baptized,
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.380]   so therefore I'm a Christian.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.220]   So we have to be careful.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.380]   How did you come to that conclusion?
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.260]   Is it coming from culture?
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.500]   Is it just from heritage?
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.380]   Or is it actually coming from the word of God?
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.500]   What does the Bible say?
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.660]   So three things that he mentions here.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.460]   One is, in order to be a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.260]   we need to know that the one that we follow
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.900]   is the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:23.020]   Not culture, not your parents, not your denomination,
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.420]   but from the Bible is the Jesus that you know.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.260]   And people often say, you know,
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.020]   the God that I know would never do this.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.340]   The God that I know would always do that.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.340]   Is that based upon the scripture of what you've studied?
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.820]   So first and foremost,
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.980]   which is what we're gonna be covering this morning,
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.660]   is a true follower of Jesus Christ
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.380]   must follow the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.860]   Not of the culture, not of our heritage,
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.300]   not of our tradition, but of the scripture.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.740]   Two, if you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.140]   you have to actually follow Jesus Christ.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.540]   You have to go where he went.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.660]   You have to do what he did.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.820]   And that's what he says in the text that we're looking at.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.060]   As I've denied myself and picked up the cross,
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.660]   he said, you must also deny yourself
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.260]   and pick up your cross and follow me.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.340]   So one, right understanding of Jesus.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.020]   Two, we must go where he goes.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.220]   And three, we must proclaim what he proclaims.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.700]   And so those are the three things
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.860]   that are outlined in the text that we read.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.860]   And so we're gonna be going over the first one today
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.100]   and then the next two hopefully we'll cover next week.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.460]   First and foremost, who is he?
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.700]   Jesus asked a question.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.180]   As he was praying, he turns around to his disciples.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.780]   And the reason why he's asking them this
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.540]   is because he's about to head to the cross.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.780]   His public ministry is starting to wrap up
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.460]   after the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.100]   He turns his attention on his disciples
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.140]   because they needed to know his identity
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.740]   because they're gonna be shaken up.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.580]   They're gonna be tested.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.820]   Their life is gonna be threatened.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:01.420]   And they're gonna see Jesus beaten
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.260]   and crucified on the cross.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.700]   And they're gonna be confused.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.860]   And at least in a smaller scale,
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.580]   they're gonna fail.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.220]   And Jesus knowing all of this
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.300]   is prepping them to go to the cross
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.460]   'cause he knows that the biggest test
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.420]   in their life during the time
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.540]   that they were following Jesus
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.460]   was gonna happen in a few months.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.020]   He's about seven or eight months away
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.540]   from being crucified on the cross.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.900]   So now he needs to make sure,
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.900]   do you really know who I am?
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.260]   And how is your opinion of me different
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.860]   from those who are the people
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.820]   who have been following me?
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.020]   And so he said, "Who do people say that I am?"
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.260]   He says, "Some say you're John the Baptist.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.380]   "Some say you're Elijah
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.660]   "and some say you're a prophet."
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.500]   In other texts, it says,
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.500]   they actually even add in Matthews
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.860]   that maybe you're Jeremiah
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.380]   because of the message that you're giving.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.760]   Right?
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.460]   Now, first and foremost,
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.500]   we need to make clear,
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.780]   being sincere doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.300]   Being sincere doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.340]   I've met so many people
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.940]   who have fallen out of an Orthodox,
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.740]   traditional evangelical church,
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.180]   a Protestant church.
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:13.980]   And I would ask them,
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.940]   "How did you end up becoming a Mormon
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.660]   "or Jehovah Witness or local church movement?
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.420]   "And how did you end up at these churches?"
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.780]   And they said, "Well, I was raised
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.660]   "in a Lutheran church
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:27.580]   "and the people there weren't that sincere.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.620]   "I don't think they took their faith seriously.
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.900]   "So then I met a bunch of people.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.700]   "I was on campus
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.900]   "and they shared the gospel with me.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.820]   "Or at least they shared
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.660]   "about what they believed the gospel to be.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.340]   "And they seemed very sincere.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.380]   "And because of their sincerity,
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.900]   "they came around, loved them,
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.660]   "took care of them,
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.540]   "invited them to the home
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.660]   "and they feel loved.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.860]   "And as a result of being loved
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.300]   "and taken care of,
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.820]   "I thought that this is the group
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.180]   "that I want to be in."
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.700]   But it wasn't a conviction of truth.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.580]   It was because they felt loved.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.180]   They wanted to belong.
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.860]   And they seemed sincere.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.780]   But sincerity in itself
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.980]   could lead you to what's false.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.060]   That's why the Bible keeps warning us
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.300]   that at the end times,
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.660]   Antichrist is gonna come
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.100]   as an angel of light.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.300]   And so if we're not paying attention,
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.900]   if we don't know what the scripture says,
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.140]   in your sincerity,
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.860]   Satan can lead you astray.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.940]   And that's why we're constantly told
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.620]   to keep your eyes on Jesus,
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.060]   the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:30.620]   Who is he?
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.860]   Who is he?
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.540]   What does the Bible tell us about him?
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.220]   Why did some people think
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.260]   he was John the Baptist?
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.900]   One, they were cousins.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.380]   So maybe, maybe,
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.460]   there was some similarity, right?
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.900]   But ultimately,
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.500]   it wasn't simply because of that.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.780]   It's because John the Baptist
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.820]   did such a great job
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.220]   that when Jesus came on the scene,
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.260]   he said the same thing.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.860]   His authority, how he preached,
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.220]   people were coming to him.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.740]   Thousands of people came to John
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.540]   and then all of a sudden,
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.060]   Jesus shows up and thousands of people
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:02.940]   are going to Jesus.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.740]   So they've never seen anything like this.
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.980]   Remember, there were hundreds of years
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.300]   where a prophet of God did not come.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.260]   So all of a sudden,
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.620]   John the Baptist appears.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.740]   Six months later,
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.860]   Jesus appears and it's like,
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.300]   is that, are they the same people?
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.020]   And John the Baptist
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.380]   just kind of disappears.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.580]   And then Jesus just kind of steps in.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.180]   It was such a smooth transition
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.700]   that some people thought
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.300]   that maybe that's John the Baptist.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.140]   But there are some other reasons
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.580]   why people had a difficult time
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.220]   letting go of John the Baptist.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.540]   Remember, the people who are
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.060]   the most loyal to John the Baptist
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.740]   had the hardest time to let go
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.020]   and to follow Jesus.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.300]   It tells us in John chapter 3, 28 and 30,
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.060]   that some of his disciples
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.260]   were beginning to get concerned
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.660]   that all these people,
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.500]   all this ministry that they built up,
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.020]   thousands of people coming out
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.380]   to see John the Baptist
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.980]   and he's become a local celebrity.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.300]   Even the kings know who he is.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.900]   And so the disciples were following him,
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.540]   were beginning to rise socially.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.100]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.300]   the snap of a finger,
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.780]   Jesus shows up on the scene
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.740]   and everybody that was following Jesus,
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.100]   all of a sudden, about face,
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.220]   he points the finger
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.140]   and then they all begin to go to him.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.740]   And so the ones who were the closest
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.260]   to John the Baptist were wondering,
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.100]   why are they all going to him?
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.340]   So they asked John the Baptist,
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.420]   what do you make of this?
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.660]   And then he answers in verse 28,
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.420]   you yourselves are my witnesses
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.060]   that I said, I am not the Christ,
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.180]   but I have been sent ahead of him.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.700]   He who has the bride is the bridegroom
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.820]   and the friend of the bridegroom
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.780]   who stands and hears him rejoices greatly
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.140]   because of the bridegroom's voice.
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.460]   So this joy of mine has been made full.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.100]   He must increase, but I must decrease.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.500]   When we read this, we say it obviously, right?
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.260]   John the Baptist is just a man.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.860]   Jesus, the son of God shows up.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.140]   Obviously he must decrease.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.740]   I mean, it's increase that he may increase.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.500]   But humanly speaking, right?
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.580]   If you were in his position
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.260]   and if you're a follower of follower
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.220]   of John the Baptist,
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.140]   maybe you sacrifice it.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.500]   Maybe you left your boat.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.700]   Maybe you left your job
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.900]   to follow John the Baptist.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.020]   And all of a sudden,
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.860]   at the peak of his success.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.260]   He just says, I must decrease what?
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.540]   Even Jesus's followers had a difficult time
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.140]   when Jesus went to the cross.
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.580]   They were concerned about
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.700]   who's going to sit on the right,
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.820]   who's going to sit on the left.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.220]   And so when Jesus went to the cross,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.260]   it didn't make any sense.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.580]   They were thinking about,
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.500]   there's got to be some payoff for this.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.060]   So you think John the Baptist's disciples
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.020]   didn't struggle with that?
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.420]   My guess is they did too.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.900]   And so they were clinging to him.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.540]   Now, the reason why I'm highlighting this
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.260]   is because there's always a temptation
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.860]   as human beings to idolize other human beings.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.580]   And so we put them on a pedestal.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:04.300]   And then when the person that we admire
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.860]   and we quote and we follow,
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.340]   fall from that pedestal,
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.180]   it ruins our faith.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.220]   I know some of you probably already read
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.540]   that somebody that again,
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.140]   that many people in our church admire
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.820]   has fallen because of his sin.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.340]   But it is unsafe to quote people
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.980]   It is unsafe to quote articles of people
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.580]   that you got your theology
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.020]   because you went to some conference,
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.420]   that you got your marching order
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.340]   from a particular individual.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.980]   It is not safe
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.260]   because anybody who stands it
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.940]   between us and Christ
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.620]   eventually will get in the way.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.220]   Anybody who speaks for God
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.420]   is simply a servant.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.900]   And just like John the Baptist,
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.260]   he points to Christ
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.380]   and when his job is over,
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.060]   that you disappear.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.140]   John disappears
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.820]   and he's never even mentioned again.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.180]   He gives his life proclaiming Christ
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.660]   and he's never even mentioned again.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.140]   You know, be careful.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.620]   You know, sometimes we get in discussion
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.060]   with theology
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.340]   and how did you come to that conclusion?
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.540]   And you say, well, he said this
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.300]   and he said that and he said this.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.660]   That has absolutely no authority
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.340]   in the Bible, in the church.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.060]   Quoting a man has no authority
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.380]   in the church, only scripture, only Christ.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.220]   And so there are men
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.820]   that God brings into our lives
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.420]   to encourage us, to challenge us,
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.380]   to inspire us.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.980]   But they are just men.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.540]   They must decrease
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.860]   so he must increase.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.260]   And it is a danger
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.580]   to put anybody on a pedestal
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.860]   that doesn't belong there
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.820]   outside of Christ.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.060]   John the Baptist was a man,
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.260]   he did such a great job.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.500]   But his time was done.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.780]   If their view of Jesus was
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.020]   that he was the John the Baptist resurrected,
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.540]   would they have been saved?
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.240]   No.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.220]   They would be in their sins.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.740]   They would be dead in their sins.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.660]   So it is a dangerous thing
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.500]   to say he was John the Baptist.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.940]   Secondly, he said,
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.220]   well, maybe he's Elijah then.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.020]   Because of the many miracles
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:13.660]   that he was performing.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.700]   Elijah was known
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.740]   as the greatest prophet
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.460]   of the Old Testament
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.220]   because of the powerful miracles
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.580]   that he performed.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.260]   He even raised people from the dead.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.140]   So they saw Jesus' miraculous work
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.220]   and they said, maybe that's Elijah
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.100]   come back from the dead.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.860]   And Malachi,
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.060]   the last book of the Old Testament,
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.500]   actually ends the prophecy
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.340]   by saying Elijah will come
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.660]   and it's clarified for us
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.740]   in Luke chapter 117,
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.660]   it is he who will go as a forerunner,
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.780]   talking about John the Baptist,
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.820]   in the spirit and power of Elijah
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.180]   to turn the hearts of the fathers
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.380]   back to the children
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.260]   and the disobedience
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.540]   to the attitude of the righteous.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.300]   So as to make ready a people
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.220]   prepared for the Lord.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.700]   They thought that he,
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.820]   maybe he was Elijah,
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.140]   because of his power.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.140]   Now, what I want to highlight here
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.820]   is sometimes
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.780]   we kind of give people a pass
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.940]   if great things are happening
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.220]   around them, right?
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.820]   They wrote a book
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.940]   and it was very influential.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.060]   So they must be using,
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.180]   being used by God.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.380]   So they must be from God.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.060]   The church is so big.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.500]   So many people came to Christ
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.460]   through his preaching.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.900]   So they must be from God.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:24.860]   And we excuse so many bad things
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.500]   in the church
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.540]   simply because they're
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.340]   bearing a lot of fruit.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.860]   But I was so touched.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.540]   I came to faith.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:34.860]   Now, it's a danger to put somebody
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.860]   in that position that shouldn't be.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.300]   Right?
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   We test all things through scripture.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.020]   Now, even God,
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.780]   there's instances in the Bible
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.300]   that God even used donkeys.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.920]   Right?
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.540]   But there's no calling to be a donkey.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.860]   And we say that all the time.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.980]   We say, well, God can use donkeys.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.100]   Yes, God can use donkeys.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.540]   God can cause the rocks to praise him.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.180]   But there's no calling to become a rock.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.940]   Right?
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.620]   We should never try to be a donkey.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:09.340]   If they thought that Jesus was Elijah
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.460]   because of his many power
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.340]   and many great things
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.300]   that are happening through him,
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.260]   they would also be dead in their sins.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.940]   So even though it may have seemed like,
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.460]   well, he's a great man.
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.700]   He's a great prophet.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.860]   But if that's where they stayed,
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.100]   they would still be dead in their sins.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.260]   And third and finally said,
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.300]   well, he's a prophet
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.260]   who come back from the dead.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.180]   Then I can't say exactly who he is,
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.420]   but clearly he was a man who was from God.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.700]   A prophet can represent God.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.900]   A prophet can do
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.500]   what God has ordained him to do.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.500]   But a prophet has no ability
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.860]   to save someone's soul.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.900]   All three of these things,
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.220]   including Jeremiah,
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.860]   would have been a huge compliment
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.020]   to any other human being.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.300]   But to declare that Jesus was there
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.900]   would have been the difference
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:02.940]   between life and death.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.380]   So Jesus turns around and says,
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.300]   that's what they say, right?
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.140]   And many people may be thinking
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:10.540]   in their hearts
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.860]   that that was a compliment to Jesus.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.100]   Not realizing that was heretical
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:15.980]   if they stopped there.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.540]   Jesus turns around and asks his disciples,
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.300]   who do you say that I am?
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.440]   Right?
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.300]   This question is the most important question
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:27.900]   in anyone's life, right?
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.740]   More than who you're going to marry.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.060]   More than what major
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.100]   that you're going to choose
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.540]   if you're starting out school.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.100]   More than what job you're going to get.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.740]   Most important question
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.820]   and how you land on this question,
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.220]   it will be the difference between
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.820]   where you spend your eternity.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.820]   Not what do your parents believe?
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.540]   What is the community believe?
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.740]   What is your denomination believe?
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:54.860]   But what do you say?
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.020]   Who do you say that I am?
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:02.060]   To declare his identity
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.420]   the way that the Bible says it
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.020]   has consequences, right?
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.060]   It has consequences
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.100]   because it's going to affect
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.300]   the way you live your life.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.780]   It's going to affect what makes you happy,
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.580]   what you pursue.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:17.260]   I don't know if you've heard it this week,
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:21.580]   but Pope Francis came out
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.620]   and made a statement
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.380]   that's completely heretical.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.160]   He said,
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.380]   "Every religion is a way to arrive at God."
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:35.740]   Now, if you haven't read it, right?
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.060]   I'm not asking you to trust me.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:38.700]   Go look it up.
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.500]   Now, this has been the soft position
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.060]   of the Catholic Church since the 1960s.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.140]   So if you've been paying attention,
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.260]   you probably already know this.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.660]   But if there was any question
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.420]   as to what the Pope
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.180]   and the Catholic Church believes,
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.700]   at least from the top,
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.620]   he says,
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.620]   "Every religion is a way to arrive at God.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.020]   There are different languages to arrive at God,
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.620]   but God is God for all.
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:06.220]   My God, but my God is more important
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:06.940]   than your God."
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:07.580]   Is that true?
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.660]   There's only one God,
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.740]   and each has a language to arrive at God.
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.140]   Sikh, Muslim, Hindu, Christian,
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.660]   they are different paths.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:20.540]   Now, he's just one man,
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.380]   but the problem with this one man
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.060]   is he speaks according to the Catholic Church ex cathedra,
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.420]   which means when he speaks in an official capacity,
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.980]   his words are infallible.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.740]   It is God's words.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.900]   It comes with God's authority.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:41.260]   What he says is law in the Catholic Church.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.260]   Now, there are Catholics who may reject this.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.060]   There are Catholics who claim to be Catholics
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.100]   and say, "We don't believe that."
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:51.420]   But the Catholic Church's official position
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.860]   is what this man says.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.180]   And by these words,
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.140]   he basically said,
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:01.100]   "All, all those who have been martyred
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.140]   for the name of Christ,
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.180]   proclaiming Christ's death and resurrection
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.700]   are a bunch of fools."
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.220]   They didn't need to do that.
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.300]   All the people who are suffering
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.060]   to gather together in North Korea,
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.700]   just even owning a Bible can get them executed,
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.500]   bunch of fools.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.420]   They didn't need to do that.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.660]   All the people who are suffering
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.380]   trying to share the gospel in remote villages in India,
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.500]   bunch of fools.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.020]   They don't need to do that.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.460]   If all roads lead to God,
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.380]   whether you're a Muslim or you're a Buddhist
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.260]   or any other religion,
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.620]   it doesn't matter what you think of Jesus
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.700]   because as long as you say God
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.780]   and you believe in some God
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.940]   that that leads to eternal life,
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.700]   then all we are doing is for nothing.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.820]   First Corinthians chapter 15, 17, 19, it says,
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.180]   "And if Christ has not been raised,
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.380]   your faith is worthless.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.060]   You are still in your sins.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.300]   Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.420]   have perished.
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:56.060]   If we have hoped in Christ in this life only,
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.540]   we are all men most to be pitied."
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.060]   If Jesus isn't who he said he is,
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.260]   if he wasn't crucified for our sins,
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.780]   if he wasn't resurrected from the dead,
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.860]   he said we are to be most pitied.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.620]   And the more seriously that you took your faith,
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.620]   you are to be more pitied than anybody else.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.700]   That's the position that this Pope took.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.260]   And he will be judged for that,
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.260]   for leading people astray.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.020]   Where you come down on this question,
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.260]   "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.420]   is going to either cause you to hate this Jesus.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.260]   How can a man have deceived this many people?
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.780]   So many people have ruined their lives because of me.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.460]   Every single one of the disciples,
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:47.660]   their life was ruined because of this confession.
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.940]   People was crucified upside down.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.260]   Some men were beheaded.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.740]   Some were torn apart by animals.
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.620]   Some were put into boiling oil.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.460]   Some took their children
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.900]   to the remotest parts of the world and died in starvation.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.020]   Every single one of them
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:10.380]   who made the correct confession of Christ
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.300]   died and were martyred in the context of this.
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.260]   The problem that we have in our generation
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.140]   is that becoming a Christian has become so easy.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.100]   We made it so easy
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.300]   so that all you need to do is just raise your hand.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.580]   Anybody want to try Jesus?
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.660]   And, oh, you want to raise your hand?
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.780]   Just come down to the middle of the aisle
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.540]   and I got some Bibles to hand out to you.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.220]   So since you raised your hand,
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.980]   repeat some words that I say,
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.340]   then now you have eternal life.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.540]   There's a reason why the Bible says
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.780]   that you must count the cost.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.820]   What does it mean to make this confession?
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.140]   What does it mean?
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.980]   Because in the first century,
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.180]   Christians, to make this confession meant
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:59.180]   that they're going to, many of them, die as martyrs.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.700]   They're going to be dragged into Colosseum.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.660]   They're going to get stoned.
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.020]   They're going to, at the minimum,
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.380]   be rejected at the synagogue.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.620]   They wouldn't be able to do their business.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.100]   Some of them, their wives thought that they went crazy
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:09.900]   and just left them.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:14.060]   They lost everything because of this confession.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.500]   So this confession cannot be made flippantly.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.780]   Even though we don't live in the first century,
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.740]   God's word and his standard has not changed.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:28.860]   So who do you say that I am?
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:33.660]   Peter confessed, "You are the Christ of God."
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.460]   "You are the Christ of God" in the Greek
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:37.900]   is a possessive term,
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.820]   meaning you are the Christ that belongs to God.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.140]   The word Christ, as you guys know,
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.300]   is from the Hebrew word "mashiach."
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.220]   And the word "mashiach" just literally means
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.180]   "the anointed one."
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:52.060]   And it was referred to as the king that was coming.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.060]   And this king who's going to come,
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.980]   who's going to be the savior of the world.
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.380]   So he's the king, the anointed one
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.900]   who will come to save us.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:07.020]   Jesus himself reads the prophecy of the Messiah
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.540]   in Isaiah 61.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.460]   He opens up this text
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.820]   and he reads it in the synagogue.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.500]   He says, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.420]   "because the Lord has anointed me
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.420]   "to bring good news to the afflicted.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.500]   "He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.260]   "to proclaim the liberty of the captives
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.700]   "and freedom to prisoners.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.420]   "Proclaim the favorable ear of the Lord
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.660]   "and the day of vengeance of our God
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.100]   "to comfort all who mourn,
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.860]   "to grant those who mourn in Zion,
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.940]   "giving them a garland instead of ashes,
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.940]   "the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.740]   "the mantle of praise instead of the spirit of fainting.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.300]   "So they will be called oaks of righteousness,
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.660]   "the planting of the Lord that he may be glorified."
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.580]   Jesus reads this and then he says,
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:50.140]   "Today, this is fulfilled in your presence."
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:54.460]   This Messiah, this king,
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.940]   the anointed one, the savior
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.820]   that you've all been waiting for is here.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.900]   Jesus made that very crystal clear.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:06.300]   When Peter says, "You are the Christ of God,"
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.780]   he's saying, "This is you."
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:13.180]   Can you imagine the elation of the people
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.100]   who've come to realize that this is the case?
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.940]   Anybody who's hungry, Jesus feeds them.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.700]   People who are lame are healed.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.660]   People who couldn't see had no hope to live.
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.340]   He opens their eyes.
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:30.860]   Even death, even a child who dies,
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.380]   he brings hope back into their life.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.900]   Those who are in prison,
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.900]   he says he's gonna open the doors, they're gonna come.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.660]   The year of jubilee is going to be gifted to you.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.140]   So can you imagine the jubilation
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.660]   of the disciples, of the people?
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.540]   That king, that Messiah has come
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.340]   and it was the right confession.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:56.300]   And he says, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you,
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.540]   but God has revealed this to you."
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:03.820]   But if their confession stops here,
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:07.100]   they will also die in their sins.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.940]   Many people came to the conclusion
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.220]   that he must be the Messiah.
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.780]   When Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.900]   shaking the palm branches, "Hosanna, hosanna.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.540]   Messiah has come, Messiah has come.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.540]   Save us, save us."
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:28.140]   Soon turned around and yelled,
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.420]   "We don't want him as our king."
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.860]   So many people come to Christ
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:34.780]   because they see this promise.
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.620]   That if I become a Christian,
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.900]   he's gonna give me purpose.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.700]   If I become a Christian, he's going to fix my life.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.180]   If I become a Christian, he'll answer my prayers.
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.940]   He's gonna be my refuge.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.500]   I'm gonna have the living water, the living bread.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.100]   And so, yes, I want that.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.980]   But if your confession of Jesus stops there,
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:56.620]   you would not know the Jesus of the Bible
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.460]   because he says something very strange.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.340]   Right after he says this,
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.500]   in Luke chapter 9, 21 and 22,
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.260]   he says, "He warned them and instructed them
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.860]   not to tell this to anyone."
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.940]   That's just weird.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.940]   If the Messiah has come
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.980]   that they've been waiting for,
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.500]   for hundreds and hundreds of years,
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.580]   and he's gonna solve all your problems,
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.460]   why would he tell them not to tell anyone?
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:25.100]   Jesus knew as soon as the word begins to spread
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.180]   and the confidence begins to spread,
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.460]   they're gonna force him to be king.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.260]   And eventually, it's gonna lead him to the cross.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.180]   And look what he says after that.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.340]   "The Son of Man must suffer many things
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.860]   and be rejected by the elders,
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:39.900]   the chief priests and scribes,
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:43.100]   and be killed and be raised up on the third day."
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.940]   Wait a minute, you're the Christ of God,
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:54.220]   and you notice he doesn't say,
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.980]   "I'm going to suffer.
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.900]   I'm planning to suffer."
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.940]   You notice he says, "I must suffer.
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:02.620]   I must suffer."
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:07.500]   Either you're the Christ of God or you're not.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.940]   How can you be the Christ of God
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.420]   and tell us that you're gonna suffer and die?
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.780]   And that's why if you read the Gospel of Mark,
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.740]   it says very clearly three separate times,
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.860]   starting from Mark chapter 9, 10 and 11,
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.220]   over and over repeated again,
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.420]   he says the exact same thing.
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.900]   That Son of Man is gonna go to Jerusalem.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:26.780]   He's gonna be captured.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.900]   He's gonna be tortured.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:28.700]   He's gonna be killed.
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:29.980]   He's gonna be raised on the third day.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.700]   And as the disciples hear him saying this,
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.580]   they don't understand.
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.220]   The very next question they give is,
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.740]   "Who's gonna sit on the left or to the right?"
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.340]   And they kept on arguing,
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.780]   "Who's the greatest in the kingdom of God?"
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:44.060]   He said he was gonna die.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.140]   And they're concerned about their glory.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.100]   He said he's gonna be beaten and killed.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.500]   They're concerned about who's gonna sit
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.540]   on the left or to the right.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.900]   It's because they didn't understand.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.660]   They saw the promises of the Messiah.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:01.260]   But when Jesus says he must suffer,
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.740]   that the only way that the captor's gonna be free,
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.060]   that the hungry is gonna be fed,
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.780]   that the injustice will be dealt with,
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.020]   is by the cross.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.900]   That all this is going to be fulfilled
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.580]   through the cross.
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:21.340]   So if you take Christ without the cross,
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.940]   that is not the Christ of the Bible.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.980]   And that's why Jesus says right after this,
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.420]   "The Son of Man must suffer."
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.540]   In Acts 4.12 it says,
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.780]   "And there is a salvation in no one else,
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.540]   "for there is no other name under heaven
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.980]   "that has been given among men
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:35.500]   "by which he must be saved."
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.380]   Again in 1 Timothy 2.5-6,
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.860]   "For there is one God,
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.380]   "there is one God,
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.300]   "and one mediator between God and man,
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.260]   "the man Christ Jesus,
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.300]   "who gave himself as a ransom for all,
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.580]   "the testimony given at the proper time."
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:56.300]   All the stuff that has gone wrong in this world
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.260]   is because of sin.
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:01.100]   It's not because we have the wrong politicians.
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.900]   It's not because we haven't had
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.500]   the right organization,
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.860]   or it's not because we don't have
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.780]   the proper organization.
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.980]   It's not because you're in the wrong denomination.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.180]   Ultimately, every problem of mankind
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:19.020]   stem from his fallen nature.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:23.740]   And so the only way to restore a broken world
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.020]   is through Christ's suffering.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.900]   And that's why he says,
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.060]   "You have confessed correctly.
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.900]   "I am the fulfillment of the promises
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.740]   "that are made in the Old Testament.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.340]   "I will set the captives free.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.620]   "I will feed the hungry.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.060]   "I will deal with the injustice."
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.580]   But the Son of Man must suffer.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.820]   He must suffer.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.500]   Because the only path to true life
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.380]   is through the cross.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:51.740]   And that's why he told his disciples,
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:53.020]   "Not only will I suffer,
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.180]   "you need to follow the path that I take."
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.860]   If we come to Christ,
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.780]   and we make the confession
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.460]   that Jesus is my Savior,
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:06.620]   he is my refuge,
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.580]   he is my comfort,
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:08.860]   he is my Abba Father,
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.540]   and we make the right confession,
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:11.660]   and yet,
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:14.400]   and yet,
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.700]   the suffering of Christ
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:19.980]   is not something that you have embraced,
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:24.220]   then you do not know the Christ of the Bible.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:29.260]   You just found Jesus to be another way
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.100]   to fulfill your dreams.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.740]   You just happen to be a Christian.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.220]   So the Buddhists seek Buddha for a better life.
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:41.900]   Muslims will seek Allah for a better life.
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:47.020]   The only difference for a Protestant
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:50.380]   is that if you end with your confession
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.780]   that Christ is the Anointed One,
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.060]   and he'll fulfill all the promise that he's made,
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.940]   it's just that you have found Christ
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:01.100]   as your way,
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.780]   a different way.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.900]   And so what Pope Francis says is true,
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:11.180]   if that's all it is.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.940]   What they reject
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:17.740]   is the same reason why they,
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.220]   in the first century, rejected Christ.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.340]   They didn't reject his works.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:24.940]   They didn't reject him as a man.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:25.900]   I mean, who would reject him?
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.780]   He's benevolent.
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.060]   He feeds the poor.
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.100]   He cares for children.
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:32.700]   I mean, even the most staunch atheists
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.820]   would admire this man.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.340]   It's what he said he was going to do.
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.700]   I am the way and the truth,
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.460]   and no one comes to the Father
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.260]   except through me.
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:47.580]   The gospel begins by telling us
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.380]   that it is our sinful nature.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.580]   It is our sin
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.820]   that's getting in the way of true life.
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:56.140]   And the only path of true life
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.500]   is a suffering of Christ
[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:58.460]   and his resurrection.
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.060]   Now, that confession in our generation
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.260]   is just simple words.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.980]   But when Jesus said it,
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.860]   every single one of these people,
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.740]   because of this confession,
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.300]   ruined their lives.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.180]   They didn't make this confession
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.780]   and then became a mega church pastor.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.060]   They didn't make this confession
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.020]   and became a doctorate
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.380]   and wrote many books
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.260]   and became wealthy.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.580]   They didn't become celebrity pastors
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.700]   and walked around
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.900]   and everybody celebrating them
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.700]   wherever they went.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.860]   Every single one of them
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.060]   who made this confession
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.460]   lost everything that they had.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.260]   Every single one of the disciples,
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.060]   everyone that they discipled,
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.340]   and the more prominent they were,
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.100]   the more suffering
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.060]   that they had to go through.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.300]   They were dragged into the Colosseum.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.420]   Some of them ripped apart,
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:50.860]   beheaded.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.300]   Why? Because of this confession.
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:58.060]   You are the Christ of God.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.540]   And the disciples didn't clearly
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.500]   understand this
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.860]   until the resurrection of Jesus.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.420]   And they realized that even in death,
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.180]   there's true life in Christ.
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.540]   Even in death.
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.860]   And that's why Apostle Paul says,
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.220]   in the light of the surpassing knowledge
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.340]   of knowing Jesus Christ,
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.540]   everything became rubbish.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.540]   And then he is pressing on
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.260]   toward the goal.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.060]   And he's pressing on
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.740]   and longing to fellowship
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.900]   in the suffering of Jesus Christ.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.660]   He's longing, pursuing,
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.140]   chasing after the suffering of Christ
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:30.940]   because he knew
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:34.540]   that the other end of that suffering
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:35.580]   was true life.
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.100]   See, when a cultural Christian
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.620]   superficially accepts Jesus Christ,
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.060]   it's no different than the disciples
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.020]   who didn't know
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.940]   until Jesus was resurrected.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.300]   We're holding on to the glory,
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.020]   the benefit.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.820]   We're holding that Jesus is going to come.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.420]   He's going to free us from our bondage.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.100]   He's going to give us food to eat.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.660]   He's going to deal with injustices.
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.940]   He's going to turn our mourning into laughter.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.140]   And we cling to that.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:07.500]   But we reject the suffering.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.220]   We reject the cross.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.380]   True life is found
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.820]   because he suffered.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.780]   And because he told us,
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.660]   as I suffered,
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.060]   you must suffer.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.460]   Because they hated me,
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.260]   they will hate you.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.860]   And some of you lose everything.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.380]   But if you believe
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.580]   that Jesus is the Christ of God,
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.460]   you also believe
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.620]   that the greatest life
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.220]   is on the other side.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.980]   It's on the other side.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.620]   When he said, "I have come to give life
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.740]   and give this life abundantly,"
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.460]   it was on the other side of the cross.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.900]   When he said that, "I will be your refuge,"
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.300]   it's on the other side of the cross.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.620]   When he said he's going to turn
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.980]   your mourning into laughter,
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.860]   it's at the other side of the cross.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.860]   That's why he says he must suffer.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.500]   And the only reason why the disciples
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.060]   did not abandon Christ
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.860]   is because they believe.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.380]   They didn't understand his cause.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.420]   They didn't understand,
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.020]   but they believed.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.300]   In John 6:16,
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.100]   but they believed.
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.780]   In John 6, 68 to 69,
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.500]   when everybody else
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.860]   was turning away from God,
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.420]   Jesus turns to his disciples,
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.940]   "Will you abandon me too?"
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.940]   Simon Peter answered him,
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.380]   "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.500]   You have the words of eternal life.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.300]   We have believed and come to know
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.620]   that you are the Holy One of God."
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.060]   Let me ask you this morning.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.220]   I'm not asking you
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.020]   what the church believes.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:51.820]   I'm not asking you
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.700]   what the confession
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.580]   that you grew up in
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.700]   or your parents believe
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.740]   or your community
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.540]   or friends believe.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.180]   Some of us are afraid
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.380]   to ask questions
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.740]   because we're afraid
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.020]   the consequence
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.540]   of losing friends and community.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.820]   So are you a seeker of community?
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.020]   Are you a seeker of truth?
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.860]   Because if you are a seeker of truth,
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:11.580]   there are times
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.180]   that seeking this truth
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.780]   will separate you from your friends,
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.580]   will cause you to leave your church,
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.900]   will cause you
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.260]   to abandon and lose.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:24.860]   Some things that are
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:25.980]   very precious to you.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.940]   Are you a seeker of community?
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.940]   Are you a seeker of truth?
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:34.620]   Who do you say he is?
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:38.300]   And if you answer
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.900]   this question correctly,
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.860]   there will be rewards
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.260]   and consequences
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.660]   that will come with confession.
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.340]   But the Bible tells us
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.340]   that true life,
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:55.580]   everything that God promises
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:59.420]   is on the other side of the cross.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.820]   So let me conclude
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.580]   with this question this morning.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.300]   If you hold on
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.980]   to a form of godliness.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.540]   With no power.
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:13.260]   You have no idea
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:15.660]   what Christ has to offer.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.700]   What you have benefited
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.620]   from with a superficial confession
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.500]   is friends.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:22.620]   Purpose.
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.540]   False hope.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.300]   Community.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.940]   Feeling loved by people around you.
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.340]   Being able to live life
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.180]   and do life with other people
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:33.820]   or like you.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.940]   But the true joy.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.260]   True hope.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:43.260]   True eternity.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.820]   Is only found
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.540]   when we are abiding
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.620]   in Christ, in Christ.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.660]   In Christ.
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:55.980]   Do you know this Jesus?
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.260]   Or are you a cultural Christian?
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.980]   Is a fear of losing
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.860]   what you have now
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.780]   causing you
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.500]   to not pursue Christ further?
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.620]   Not ask difficult questions.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:13.900]   Are you a pursuer of community?
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.140]   Are you a pursuer of truth?

[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.100]   Let's pray.
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:27.660]   Father, we pray
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.180]   that the power of your word
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.140]   would cut through
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.780]   the veneer, Lord God,
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.060]   that we allow
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.780]   to be established in our hearts.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.260]   I pray, Father God,
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.860]   that your word and your spirit
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:41.660]   would melt.
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:44.460]   The facade, Lord God,
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.500]   that we often
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.980]   work so hard to create.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.060]   But we pray, Father,
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.180]   as you told us
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.940]   that your sheep know your voice
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.060]   and they follow you.
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.140]   I pray that your word
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.420]   would be made clear.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.700]   That your voice is what we hear.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.420]   And it is you that we follow.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.260]   In Jesus name we pray.
