[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11, and we are going
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.040]   to cover again just one verse.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.360]   So at this rate, we're going to be in Hebrews for a while.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.280]   But as I said, those, these three verses, verse 20 to 22, actually represents almost
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.160]   about 35 to 40 chapters.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.280]   And so the verse that we're looking at in verse 21 about Jacob covers about 13 to 14
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.720]   chapters, about 13 chapters.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.180]   And so instead of just kind of doing a quick overview and saying, by faith, he did this
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.520]   and moving on, I think it'll be helpful for us to understand the context behind what it
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.560]   means when he says, by faith, Jacob did this.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.560]   Okay.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.360]   So let me read it again in verse, let me just read verse 21, and then we'll jump into the
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360]   text.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.880]   By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worship leaning
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.120]   on the top of his staff.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   Let's pray.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.520]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your guidance.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.920]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to speak to us.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:18.360]   May your word be handled in a way that honors you, that only your voice may be proclaimed.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.200]   Give us eagerness, Lord God, to hear from you and to apply and shape our hearts and
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.600]   our lives, Lord God, according to your will and purpose.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.360]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360]   Amen.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.600]   You know, through the pandemic, and I know that even in our church, there are some people
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.120]   who lost loved ones for various reasons.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.120]   Obviously this happens, you know, that's just part of life, but you know, it's especially
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.200]   hard when you lose someone during COVID because of all the restrictions at the hospital and
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.640]   at the funeral homes.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.760]   And, you know, this year, I didn't mention this to Lee, but, you know, Lee's father passed
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.760]   away and we were at the funeral and Lee's father actually left a letter to his children
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.120]   and his family.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.160]   And I was really intrigued to hear because, you know, they were so blessed.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.000]   And so he gave me an opportunity to read it and I was so encouraged by it.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.920]   And again, obviously I don't know his father, I don't know what his life was like, but you
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.660]   could tell that in that letter how much God meant to him.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.640]   And so everything that he wrote in there and he wrote it to the family, he wrote it to
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.000]   each one of his children, that this is what he desires and, you know, sharing his mistakes,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.680]   that don't make these mistakes, but, you know, making sure that you guys prioritize, you
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.600]   know, church, prioritize God, prioritize his word.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.960]   And I was just so blessed to read that, knowing that that was the last thing that he left
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.200]   behind to his family and children.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.740]   You know, we take anything that somebody says in the last words very seriously because we
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.560]   know that it's not going to be frivolous, that whatever it was in your heart is what
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.620]   you're going to leave behind.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.900]   This is what I want you to remember.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.920]   This is the totality of the things that I know in life, that this is something that
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   I want you to have.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.160]   And that's how in the book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon at the end of his life summarizes
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.880]   all of his experience and says, "The chief end of man is to fear God and to worship him,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.000]   to obey him."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.600]   That's why we take the Great Commission very seriously because of all the things that Jesus
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.640]   taught at the end, he gave that commission to the church, "Go make disciples of all the
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.960]   nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit."
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   He taught many other things, but the reason why we call that the Great Commission is because
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.220]   that was the last commandment that he left the church.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.180]   And so since then, that's what drives the church.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.000]   This is what he's placed us to do, to go and be a light to the world.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.920]   And again, another thing that, again, that my dad said when, you know, he was alive that
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.520]   I remember, you know, when you're young, your dad says things just kind of like, "Yeah,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.160]   okay, you know, that sounds good."
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.280]   But years later, you think back and it makes so much sense and there's so much wisdom behind
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.280]   it.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000]   And one of the things that my dad said that really stuck with me, he said, "How you leave
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.160]   something is much more important than how you came."
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   He said, "Much more important because how you leave is what they will remember from
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.760]   that point on."
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.200]   And again, it's so true, there's so much wisdom behind that, that we start with a bang and
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.960]   then we end with the fizzle.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.400]   And typically, that's how human relationships are, you know, like we start with excitement
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.080]   and then it just kind of fizzles out and then we have experience after experience of bad
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.360]   experiences.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.040]   But it's much more important how we end than how we started.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.640]   Jacob's life was a man who his...
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.200]   We're talking about in this one verse, at the end of his life, he's blessing his children
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.720]   so that God's covenant blessing will be passed on.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.040]   And in this short sentence contains basically the totality of his life.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.160]   What was most important to him is at the tail end, he knows he's going to die and he wants
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.560]   to make sure that his children are blessed.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.200]   And so that little phrase, "By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.720]   of Joseph," reminds us of the way he died and what is stated about his death tells us
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.920]   that this man truly was a man of faith.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.960]   In fact, in Numbers chapter 23, verse 10, remember the prophet Balaam, right?
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.000]   He was trying to be recruited in order to put a curse on the nation of Israel and he
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.760]   recognizing that this family had a special blessing from God and he refuses.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.000]   And in Numbers 23, verse 10, he says this, "Who can count the dust of Jacob or number
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.800]   the fourth apart of Israel?
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.920]   Let me die the death of the upright and let my end be like his."
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.800]   So even in Numbers 23, 10, there was something about Jacob's death that he says, "I want
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   to die.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.760]   Not only do I want to live like him, but I want to make sure that I die like him."
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.880]   And so this phrase, again, this verse in verse 21 contains all that they knew about his death,
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.120]   that they were passing down from generation to generation.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.080]   So what is contained in this verse that we are to glean from?
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.160]   So let's look at the text, right?
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.160]   Verse 21, "By faith Jacob blessed Joseph's two sons."
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.440]   Do you notice something interesting here?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.520]   Who are Joseph's two sons?
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.000]   It's his grandchildren.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.320]   Usually when the father passes away, he blesses his children.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.680]   It's supposed to go to, the blessing really should go to his children, but here the highlight
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.680]   and his blessing at the tail end of his life doesn't say he blessed, who should have been
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   blessed?
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.680]   Reuben, right?
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.920]   Reuben was the first child of the 12, or any one of these children, but he says he blessed
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.600]   Joseph's two children.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.240]   So what's going on here that him blessing his grandchildren are highlighted above the
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.560]   others?
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.920]   Now we already know that Reuben was the first child of the 12, and he's the one who should
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.440]   have gotten the double blessing.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.320]   Instead, Reuben is bypassed.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:12.360]   It says in Genesis chapter 35 verse 22, "Because of his sin, he forfeited his birthright."
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.800]   That he ended up sleeping with Jacob's concubine and defiled that, and as a result of that
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   he lost his privilege.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.960]   So it wasn't that he wasn't blessed, but his first born blessing was passed on.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.240]   And so that's what he's saying here.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.440]   He's passing it on.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.320]   And so what I want to look at this morning is Genesis chapter 48 verse 1, to look at
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.720]   the context, the historical context behind which this takes place, and what is it about
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   his blessing and his tail end that is meant to give us a reminder and as an example what
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.880]   it means to be a man of faith.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.280]   So Genesis chapter 48 verse 1, it starts off by saying, "Now it came about after these
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.260]   things that Joseph was told, 'Behold, your father is sick.'
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.800]   So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him."
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.920]   You notice the order of the names of Joseph's son, Manasseh and Ephraim.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.760]   Remember we said that whenever you see the order in something, there's significance in
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.140]   the Bible?
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.040]   So Manasseh is the older son.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.080]   Ephraim is the younger son.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.120]   And that's why they're mentioned in that order.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.000]   But look with me in verse 5, chapter 48 verse 5.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.080]   "Now your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.200]   Egypt are mine."
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.680]   So this is Jacob talking to Joseph.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.400]   And then he calls them, "Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are."
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.480]   So there's two things that we need to recognize.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:43.840]   One, where Jacob says, "I'm going to treat them not as my grandchildren, but my own children.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.700]   I'm going to bless them just as I will bless my other children, I will bless them like
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.700]   my grandchildren."
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.960]   So they're not going to get residuals from what you have.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.040]   I'm going to directly put my blessing upon them.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.300]   So that's the first thing that we need to recognize.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.360]   But the second thing is, look at the order in which he mentions it.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   Right?
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.040]   Joseph, it's Manasseh and Ephraim.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.500]   Jacob mentions it by Ephraim and Manasseh.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.160]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.160]   Right?
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.280]   It wasn't that the author was dyslexic and he was just getting the order, you know, mixed
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.000]   up.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.420]   In verse 8 through 10, "When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, 'Who are these?'
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.340]   Joseph said to his father, 'They are my sons, whom God has given me here.'
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.320]   So he said, 'Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.'
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.880]   Now the eyes of Israel were so dim from age that he could not see."
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.160]   Does that remind you of something?
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.600]   Right?
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.040]   Anybody who was awake last week, right, in the last week's text, and that whole drama
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.480]   of, you know, of Jacob scheming and taking over Esau's blessing because Isaac could not
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.680]   see and kind of tricking and, you know, put on fur to trick his dad?
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.240]   And he said, well, at the end of his life, I mean, his blindness may be genetic.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   Right?
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.400]   So he said the same thing.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   He was in the same position.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.080]   He could not see.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.760]   And it was time to pass on the blessing, starting from verse 11 through 20.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.800]   "Israel said to Joseph, 'I never expected to see your face, and behold, God has let
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.600]   me see your children as well.'
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.400]   Then Joseph took them from his knees and bowed with his face to the ground.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:28.960]   Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left, and Manasseh with
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.600]   his left hand toward Israel's right, and brought them close to him."
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.780]   And it was very deliberate because his father can't see.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:45.160]   And so Joseph wanted to make sure that his older son had the right hand blessing because
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.920]   the right hand blessing meant that he was going to get the double blessing because he's
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   the older child.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.640]   So he did it deliberately in order to not to make the mistake, right?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.400]   Not to make the same mistake that Isaac made that he's making sure.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   Okay?
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.040]   My guess is Joseph probably heard the story, you know, it was passed down how his father
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   got the blessing.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.680]   He's like, "No, you know, obviously this runs in the family.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.440]   We're not going to let this happen again."
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.080]   So he takes them by their hand and he places them so that all he had to do is put his hands
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.480]   on them.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.400]   And so he brings them in that order, but in verse 14, "But Israel stripped out his hand,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.120]   right hand, and laid it on the head of Ephraim."
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.800]   So instead of doing this, what does he do?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.680]   He does this, right?
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.640]   "Who was the younger and his left hand on Manasseh's head, crossing his hands, although
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.680]   Manasseh was the firstborn.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.440]   He blessed Joseph and said, 'The God before whom my father Abraham and Isaac walked, the
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.280]   God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, the angel who has redeemed me from
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   all evil.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.160]   Bless the lads and may my name live on them and the names of my father Abraham and Isaac.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.360]   And may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.'"
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.640]   So Joseph sees what's going on.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.120]   His father is switching his arms and maybe he's forgotten.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.680]   He doesn't see correctly.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.000]   And so Joseph tries to correct him in verse 17, "When Joseph saw that his father laid
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.680]   his right hand on Ephraim's head, it displeased him."
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.520]   You messed up, like father, like son, right?
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.320]   "It displeased him and he grasped his father's hand and removed it from Ephraim's head to
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.600]   Manasseh's head.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.360]   So Joseph said to his father, 'Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.280]   Place your right hand on his head.'"
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.520]   Remember what happened to Jacob and Esau?
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.680]   Because Isaac blessed Jacob over Esau?
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:47.040]   They lived in contention and fighting all their life because Esau got mad.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.080]   And I think maybe Joseph was thinking, "If you do this, these two are going to be fighting
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.600]   the rest of their life."
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.400]   And in order to say that, he said, "You did this wrong."
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.920]   And he was displeased and he grabbed his father's hand to make it right.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:06.080]   And Jacob says first, but his father refused and said, "I know, my son.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.360]   I know.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.760]   I am not Isaac."
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.760]   I added that.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.200]   That's not in the text.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.720]   My guess is, he remembers all of this and he said, "It's not a mistake.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.120]   I'm not being tricked.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.040]   I know I don't see, but this is deliberate.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.320]   He also will become a people and he also will be great.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.080]   However, his younger brother shall be greater than he and his descendants shall become a
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.720]   multitude of nations.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.480]   He blessed them that day saying, 'By you Israel will pronounce blessing,' saying, 'May God
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.320]   make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.080]   Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh."
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.500]   Was not a mistake like his father.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:53.380]   He was not being tricked, but clearly it wasn't just a whim of Jacob.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.340]   Since we got switched, I'm going to switch you too.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.060]   Clearly Jacob knew something that God wanted him to do.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.660]   That this was clearly God ordained.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.660]   This is not a mistake.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.980]   I'm not trying to get you to be contentious and then create the older brother being angry
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.380]   and jealous all of his life.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.740]   He said, "That's not what he's doing."
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.940]   God had a clear plan of what he was doing.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.460]   And part of the reason, it doesn't spell it out for us, but if you look at the genealogies
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.860]   of Jesus, there are people in there that we would say, "That can't be the genealogy of
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.540]   Jesus.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.300]   There's adulterers and murderers in that genealogy."
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:38.500]   If we were to create a genealogy of our Lord and Savior, that is not the genealogy that
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.540]   we would create.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.940]   Does anybody looking from the outside, is like, "You worship a God who came from a prostitute?
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.900]   From a murderer?"
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.260]   One of the clear things that we see in scripture is that God does not follow the natural pattern
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.860]   that you and I expect.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.620]   And part of the reason why he does that is to make it clear that his blessing does not
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.500]   come by man's effort.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.860]   It is God who chooses.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.020]   It is God who is sovereign.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.100]   He has his own plans.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.340]   He's not submitted to man's desires, but his will.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.580]   I think Joseph should have known from the very get-go that this was God's plan, because
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.780]   you know what Ephraim's name means?
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.380]   Ephraim's name means double portion.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.180]   And you know what Manasseh's name means?
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.660]   Forgotten.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.100]   So I would think that Joseph, when he brought them, he's like, "I hope they don't live up
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.900]   to their name."
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.300]   Maybe God had ordained this, that this is what he desired in order so that his blessing
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.060]   would continue to go.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.700]   But I also, I think we need to take a step back and understand what's going on here,
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:53.580]   because if it was simply the blessing to pass the double portion of his property and his
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:58.100]   name to his children, who was richer here?
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:04.140]   Usually when the father or grandfather passes away, you're waiting because they have a lifetime
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.140]   of accumulation of wealth that they're passing down.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.780]   And usually the older has more money than the younger, usually, right?
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.560]   Think about who Joseph is.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.860]   Think about who these children are.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.540]   Joseph is the second in command to Pharaoh.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:25.060]   Remember, Jacob and his children barely survived through the famine because of Joseph.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:31.420]   So whatever Joseph had pales in comparison to what Joseph had had opportunity to have.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:39.120]   So Ephraim's two children were heirs of whatever Joseph had.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.820]   So humanly speaking, this blessing that's coming from Jacob really was nothing, humanly
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.820]   speaking.
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:51.100]   A double portion or triple portion or everything that you had probably was just a drop in the
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:56.820]   bucket to the wealth that they had an opportunity to have.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.980]   Obviously this was not about the wealth.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.620]   This wasn't simply about their name.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.940]   It was about the covenant blessing that was coming from God.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.140]   Far above any human wealth, far above any power that Pharaoh would have had or they
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.680]   would have been heirs of.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.660]   They're talking about the heir of what God has promised, God Almighty.
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.060]   And Jacob understood that, Isaac understood that, Abraham understood that.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:29.500]   Now Joseph and his two children, Ephraim and Manasseh, is standing in line to receive
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.180]   that blessing.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:39.820]   You could see God's sovereign hands when he says in verse 21, "By faith Jacob, as he
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.660]   was dying, blessed each one of the sons of Joseph."
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.460]   It was faith.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.980]   It was faith of who God is.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.980]   He wasn't simply passing on material possession.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.740]   It was God's blessing.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:59.340]   But you know, we naturally ask the question, which Jacob would have also understood.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.920]   Why does Jacob get it?
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.700]   Why does Ephraim get it?
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:09.580]   Clearly in Jacob's life, Jacob was, even though he was a schemer and he did all that
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:19.380]   he did, Jacob's life was a constant reminder to us that God blesses those who desire it.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:25.260]   Jacob, simple answer, God gave it to him because he wanted it more than anything else.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.660]   He became the one who contended with God.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.500]   And so God's blessing came down the line that, again, for the people who wanted it
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.540]   the most, and that was Jacob.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.700]   Now he's passing it on, and then here's an interesting thing that he says.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.140]   After that he says he worshipped.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.740]   Now in our, the way that we speak of worship, you know, typically we say, "What time is
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.740]   your worship?"
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.060]   Right, so we have one at nine o'clock, we have one at eleven o'clock.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.900]   Well when does your worship end?
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:19:02.300]   Right, sometimes it ends at 10.15, sometimes when I go long it's 10.30, right?
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.900]   And anything beyond that, you're frustrated, right?
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.140]   That's when it ends, right?
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.060]   So when does it end, when does it begin?
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.900]   How many people at your worship?
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.140]   Right, and that's the way we describe worship.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:20.420]   But the word for worship here, about 80 to 90% of the New Testament translation of the
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.700]   word worship comes from this one particular word, proskuneo.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:30.580]   And the word proskuneo literally means to be prostrated, to bow down.
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:36.860]   And the picture of this is clearly seen in the book of Isaiah chapter six, verse three
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.580]   to five, when Isaiah is given a glimpse of God's glory in his throne.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.740]   And you have the three creatures who are circling around his throne, day and night, declaring,
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.300]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.580]   The whole earth is full of his glory."
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.380]   And they were praising God, and the foundations of the threshold trembled at the voice of
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.100]   him who called out while the temple was filling with smoke.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:08.220]   Then I said, and this is Isaiah's response to seeing his glory, "Woe is me, for I am
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:13.380]   ruined because I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.940]   For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.620]   It doesn't describe that Isaiah bowed down and he was prostrated, but you could tell
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.100]   by his words that's exactly what was going on.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.860]   Because he could not lift his eyes to see his glory, in fact, he was terrified.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.620]   Because something that was so magnificent, something that was all inspiring, that he
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.620]   was in front of, and naturally he bowed down and said, "Woe is me, for I am ruined."
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:47.500]   The word proskuneo literally means to be prostrated, to be bowed down, and leaned forward.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.800]   In fact, another meaning behind this is to lean forward to kiss.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:57.100]   To kiss the feet of somebody who is much bigger than you, much higher than you.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:04.260]   I think we see this spontaneous worship, again, in sports arenas, or maybe you're watching
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.780]   something that's so awe-inspiring.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.820]   As an example, if somebody, let's say LeBron James or Kobe Bryant, whoever you're a fan
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:17.780]   of, comes and he does a double, triple flip, back flip, behind the back, and he does a
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.900]   reverse dunk with five guys guarding him.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.220]   As an example, I'm just trying to exaggerate for the purpose of the illustration.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.460]   You see something magnificent, and what do you see?
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:36.020]   A lot of times, his other players or the fan that's watching this are so affected by what
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.780]   he did, you see them getting up, and what do they do?
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.860]   Raise their hand, what do they do?
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.620]   "We're not worthy.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.220]   We're not worthy."
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.580]   That's what we see.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.660]   This word proskuneo is a description of that.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.620]   It's a description of when you're confronted with something so bigger than you, beyond
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.780]   you, that all you can do spontaneously, you burst out.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.720]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, we're not worthy.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.920]   We're not worthy."
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.660]   That's that word.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.620]   Again, it is not wrong to say, you know, our gathering of worship at 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock,
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.980]   but when we limit, when that's our whole idea of understanding, it is a trivial understanding
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.720]   of what the Bible teaches about worship.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.620]   Worship is something when our eyes become open to His glory, and we recognize there's
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:30.060]   something so much more tremendously above that you and I could possibly comprehend,
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:35.940]   and we spontaneously respond in worship and adoration and awe and fear, all at the same
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.760]   time.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.140]   That's that word proskuneo, and that's how surrender happens.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.820]   Surrender is not us trying so hard to make Jesus my Lord.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.500]   Surrendering happens as you recognize He knows better than you.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.540]   He's much bigger than you.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:59.220]   He's much more important than you, and so when you are confronted by that, you end up
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.720]   surrendering.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.360]   You recognize you know nothing.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.700]   There's nothing that you have.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.180]   There's nothing that you can say.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:10.100]   There's nothing that you understand that goes beyond what you have just seen.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.260]   That's proskuneo.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.500]   That's the word that is described when He says, "After He blesses them, He proskuneo,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.660]   then He worshiped God."
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:31.540]   Now, we have to understand when it says He worshiped God, right, remember Jacob's life.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.020]   Jacob schemed in order to get the blessing.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.260]   Humanly speaking, we're going to look at that and say, "Well, that guy shouldn't be getting
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.260]   the blessing.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.980]   Esau deserves the blessing."
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.580]   However you look at the circumstance, he gets the blessing.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.020]   He comes out, and remember the dream that he has, the Jacob's Ladder?
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.020]   He sees the angels going back and forth, and God speaks to him, "What is this?"
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.740]   And then God reiterates the blessing given to him.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.580]   Genesis 28, 13-15, "And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, 'I am the Lord, the God
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.340]   of your father Abraham, and the God of Isaac, the land on which you lie.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.120]   I will give it to you and to your descendants.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.340]   Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.860]   west and to the east and to the north and to the south.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.420]   And in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.860]   Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land,
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:27.740]   for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.'"
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:33.740]   Now even though he schemed, even though he manipulated, and even though he lied, because
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.420]   he desired it more than anything else, God blesses him and he reiterates, "You have my
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.740]   blessing."
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.980]   God himself tells him that.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:48.740]   If I heard this, I would automatically think, "I'm going to just start any business, right?
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.300]   Because God says he's going to bless me."
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.540]   I would automatically assume that I'm going to have 70,000 children.
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:04.820]   You're going to have triplets and ... because you've got to populate the world, right?
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.700]   I would assume that you're going to be the owner of the largest piece of land.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.060]   It's just going to plop down, that you would expect that.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:17.020]   But that's not what happens, right?
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:22.660]   In fact, Jacob lives most of his life afraid of his older brother, Esau.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:28.820]   He's constantly running in fear because his brother was so angry that he got ripped off
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.060]   and every opportunity he had, and that reason, like after he gets the blessing, he has to
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.780]   go run.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.220]   Remember what happens after that, after the Jacob's Ladder?
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.180]   He runs into Rachel and he falls in love.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.800]   Remember that story?
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.460]   He falls in love and he has to work to get her.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:54.120]   That story is mentioned in Genesis 29, 17 to 20.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.060]   It says, "And Leah's eyes were weak."
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.700]   Leah's Rachel's older sister.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.620]   "And Rachel was beautiful of form and face."
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.180]   Let me stop right there, okay?
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:12.100]   He falls in love with Rachel because she was beautiful of form and face, but Leah was,
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.100]   her eyes were weak.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.140]   What does that mean?
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.300]   Why does the author mention that she has poor sight?
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:30.220]   Most commentators believe it's a euphemism to say there wasn't much to look at, right?
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.780]   I mean, this is politically incorrect, but the Bible just spells it out.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.340]   This is the circumstance behind what happened, right?
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.580]   So again, next time you go on a date and you come back and your friends ask, "How was
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.580]   she?"
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:49.660]   Instead of saying she has a great personality, just say, "Her eyes were weak."
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.460]   And hopefully they read the Bible, they know what you mean, right?
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.460]   Because that's what he's saying.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.460]   He's just laying out.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.660]   There's not a lot to behold, but he falls in love with Rachel because she was beautiful.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.780]   Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter,
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.780]   Rachel."
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.740]   And Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.740]   Stay with me."
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.500]   Look what he says, verse 20.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.540]   So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.660]   of his love for her.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.620]   Just seven, what's seven years, right?
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.660]   He's falling in love with Rachel.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.020]   If at the end of seven years I can labor and live like an indentured servant, if I can
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.060]   get Rachel, this is worth it.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.580]   You know what happens.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.220]   Seven years he labors in love, it's nothing.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:44.580]   And then on his marriage day, Laban, her father, tricks him and sends in Leah because he's
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.900]   probably concerned because her eyesight was not good.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:56.140]   But maybe this is the best chance for him to get his daughter married off.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:01.900]   So he tricks him and has him lay with Leah instead.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:06.620]   And when morning comes, he said, "Well, you took Leah."
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.940]   And he said, "How can you do this to me?
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.620]   I worked seven years for you.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.940]   How can you do this to me?"
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.060]   And he just simply says, "It is not done in our land to have the younger married before
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.020]   the older, so you have to take the older one."
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.020]   Seven years.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.580]   Let's think about that.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.060]   You know, just seven years.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:28.220]   It was like every year, every day, it's like one more day, one more month.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:35.060]   You know, can you imagine on the seventh day, the last day, boom, I did it.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.460]   Another seven years.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:43.520]   Not for Rachel because of the bad-eyed girl, right?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.620]   Can you imagine what the next seven years was like for him?
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:53.340]   If seven years went by fast, the next seven years probably was like torture.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.620]   Bitterness and anger every single day, another day because I got tricked.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.140]   That's his life.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.180]   This is after God blessed him and said, "You're going to multiply.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.580]   You're going to have this land.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.900]   Everybody else is going to be blessed because of you."
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.300]   And now he's 14 years in labor because he got tricked.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.100]   And then after the 14 years are done, he's ready to go.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.220]   And then LeBan says, "You can't leave."
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.500]   And he holds him for another six years.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:24.820]   So for 20 years, he's living as an indentured servant after he received the promise of God.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:30.180]   Well, after the 20 years, you would think that it would be done, but you know what happens,
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.180]   right?
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.500]   After 20 years, there's another disaster that happens.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.180]   One of his daughters gets raped and his other sons get angry.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.180]   They go and they kill that whole family.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.500]   And that family, they're much more powerful and richer than he is.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:52.980]   And so again, he has to pack up all his bags and he has to leave and run away to Bethel.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:53.980]   That's his life.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.620]   And he said, "Oh, the suffering's behind me.
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.620]   Hopefully, this is enough."
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.220]   But you know what happens?
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.220]   Contention happens within the brothers.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:06.740]   And because Joseph has a dream that God had ordained that blessing was going to come through
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.740]   his family, remember what happens?
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.420]   His brothers get angry and they get jealous and they beat him and then they end up selling
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.900]   him as an Egyptian slave.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:23.940]   So he loses his loved child most of his life.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.200]   That's his life.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   That's most of his life.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.780]   That was his life after he received the blessing.
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.980]   Now, you would think at the end of his life, he's like, "Well, I'm going to bless you."
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.420]   He's like, "I don't know if you want this blessing."
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.420]   You know?
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.660]   Because after I got this blessing, you know what happened to me?
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:46.020]   I don't know if I want to pass on this blessing.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.580]   But he says he broke out in worship.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.700]   How can he break out in worship after that?
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:59.660]   What was it that he knew that caused him to be prostrated?
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:07.300]   By this time, what Jacob knew, that the blessing was far beyond land.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.580]   It wasn't about wealth.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:15.340]   It was about the sovereign God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and now Jacob.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:20.260]   And the promise that he made was going to be passed down.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:26.340]   In fact, the time that has passed between the initial promise to Abraham to the passing
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.620]   of the baton to Joseph's children, 200 years have passed.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:35.100]   No land, no nation, and they're not the superpower.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.460]   200 years have passed.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.060]   How many years pass, more pass, before they even enter their first step into the promised
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.420]   land?
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.220]   440 more years pass.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:55.420]   So after he blesses, if Jacob's life was hard, after he blesses Abraham and Manasseh, they
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:01.140]   become slaves for 400 years.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.180]   I don't know if you want this blessing.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.460]   Who want this?
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:10.220]   I would scheme to get the other brother to be blessed.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.660]   I would make sure that he gets it.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.660]   Even if I was the older brother, give it to him.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.460]   I don't want this.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:22.500]   Hebrews chapter 11, 39 to 40 says this, "And all these, having gained approval through
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:28.020]   their father, through their faith, did not receive what was promised, because God had
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:34.580]   provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect."
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:40.860]   At some point in their journey, they realized it wasn't about the physical promised land.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.240]   Their faith began to grow.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.260]   It was much more than that.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.620]   It was about salvation.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.720]   It was about God's plan of redemption for mankind.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.660]   And so his blessing that he's passing on to them is that God of the universe who blessed
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.060]   your grandfather, me, and now to you.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:04.380]   You know what's interesting is that he, Prosconeo, okay, that's why he worshiped, because they
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.140]   saw a bigger God than Pharaoh.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.020]   They saw a blessing much far beyond this physical world.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.980]   That even in the greatest tragedy, God is still sovereign.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.520]   There's a plan.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   And he believed that.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.100]   And when he recognized that, he was bound down in worship.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:29.420]   You know what's interesting is after he worships, it ends with leaning on the top of his staff.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.300]   And again, this is why inductive Bible study is so important, because when you just read
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.700]   it through, you're going to say, "Oh, he was blessed and he had a staff."
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.100]   And I don't know why that's there, but it's there.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.860]   And I was wrestling with this all week, right?
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.580]   And I was trying to look at commentaries and listen to sermons and going back and forth.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.580]   Why is that there?
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:53.620]   Because, you know, some people will say that, you know, the staff in the Bible oftentimes
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.640]   represents authority.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.740]   So in Psalm 23, verse 4, it says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.820]   death, I fear no evil, for you are with me.
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.100]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:07.800]   So a shepherd would hold his staff basically as a weapon.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.300]   So if the wolves come in, he would use that to protect and sometimes guide, right?
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.820]   Guide the sheep to go to discipline and get them to the right place.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.780]   But why would that be stated here, right?
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:27.820]   Why would he worship and then he leaned on his staff?
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:33.800]   Think about what that staff meant, particularly to Jacob, right?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.480]   Think about what that staff meant specifically to Jacob.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.780]   For Jacob, it wasn't just a symbol, right?
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.500]   For Jacob, it wasn't just because he was a shepherd and in the middle of shepherding,
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.620]   he had to have that staff to protect his animals.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.380]   I mean, he was at his deathbed.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:56.900]   That staff was his actual crutch.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:02.260]   Because after all that scheming, at the end, he was about to meet his brother Esau, and
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.580]   he knew that Esau wanted to kill him.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.860]   And so he encounters the angel of God and he wrestled, remember that?
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.700]   He wrestles and he wouldn't let him go.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.860]   So all night he wrestles with God, he said, "I'm not going to let you go until you bless
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.940]   me, until you make things okay."
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.060]   And then he says, "Okay, okay."
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.060]   So God ends up losing.
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.660]   I mean, of course, he didn't really lose.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.580]   God could have just said, "Get away from me," and then that would have been it, right?
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.500]   But he wanted Esau to contend with God.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.580]   And as a result of that, what does he do?
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:46.500]   God dislocates his hip joint to remind him that this is the day that you wrestled with
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.420]   God.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:54.620]   And so when they took his hip joint out, he had a limp all his life.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.780]   So that staff to him was a crutch.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.860]   And so God did that deliberately to remind him.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:09.260]   And the nation of Israel isn't called Abraham, isn't called Isaac, it's called Israel, after
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.260]   what he did.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:16.540]   In fact, this event was so significant in Genesis 32, verse 32, it says, "Therefore
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:21.400]   to this day, the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the socket
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:30.540]   of the thigh, because he touched the socket of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip."
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:36.420]   All the things that he experienced, all the scheming and his business savvy and all of
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:45.660]   that he did, God made him limp all his life to remind him that the blessing came to you
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.180]   because you contended with God.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:53.140]   Because you sought after me, you wrestled and you said, "I'm not going to let you go."
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:58.060]   And then he named the whole nation, all the descendants after that, so that every time
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:02.420]   they say, "Why are we called Israel?
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.220]   How come he wasn't named after Abraham?
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.920]   He's the one who started, he's the father of faith.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.220]   He's the one who started all of this.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.460]   Why aren't we called Abraham?
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.460]   Why not Isaac?
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.260]   Isaac's the one who was going to be offered."
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.780]   And it pointed to the coming of Christ.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.540]   He was a clear type of Christ.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.140]   Why aren't we called Isaac?
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.780]   Why are we called Israel?
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.020]   So that they would tell their children, "It's because your grandfather, great, great, great
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.140]   grandfather, he contended with God.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.060]   He sought after God.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:39.800]   He wanted the blessing from God more than anything else in his life."
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:46.560]   And so that staff that he was leaning on is a reminder of all that journey.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:52.940]   Because every time he took a step, it was a reminder that the greatest thing that he
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:58.060]   did in life was contending with God.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:02.020]   That's a consistent lesson that we see all throughout scripture.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.020]   You know, whenever something goes wrong, we want to fix it.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.820]   If we do this and organize this, we have the right people, we have the right finances,
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.480]   right program, right teaching, right discipleship.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.220]   If we do all of this, we can get it right and make a church and do all of this.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.180]   And at the end, when it works, what do we do?
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.060]   Because I was smart, because I worked hard, because I was disciplined.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.500]   And all of that, if you're not careful, is man scheming.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.540]   That somehow if we're smart enough, if we're good enough, if we have experience enough,
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:36.980]   if I know enough, if I'm talented enough, that somehow the blessing of God is going
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.380]   to fall on me.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.420]   Remember what Jesus said to his disciples before he left?
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:47.740]   You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.020]   He told them the same thing, remain in me.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.620]   Rely on me.
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.300]   Depend on me.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   Continue with me.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:01.620]   Because you cannot bear fruit until you depend on me.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.580]   This is why prayer is so important.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:08.140]   That sometimes even Bible study is our scheming.
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:14.020]   If we know more, if we study more, if I exposit more, if I remember more, that somehow I'm
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.620]   going to force God's blessing upon me.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:24.100]   No, it's when we surrender more, when we recognize we are weak, when we recognize with
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:29.020]   all the scheming that I had, he could not shake his brother.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:34.060]   All the effort, all the money that he had could not quench his brother's anger toward
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.060]   him.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:40.340]   And he knew that the only hope that he had is if God would protect him.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.940]   And so he contended with God.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:49.020]   And that's why he was delivered from that, the only what God can do.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:54.660]   Salvation of mankind is not something that you and I do because we're clever.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.700]   That if you get the right gifted person who is rightly trained and give them right education,
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:04.580]   read the right books, connect them with the right people, people will be saved.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.380]   The arrogance of that.
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:14.900]   The human arrogance of thinking that God is looking for smart people to do his work, program
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.100]   in a certain way, organize in such a way.
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.100]   No.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:27.740]   The greatest, greatest place where God is always taking his people is for us to surrender.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.900]   Recognize I don't have it in me.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:37.100]   And when I come before God and contend with God and surrender to God, begging God, asking
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:43.260]   God, he says he will answer.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:51.300]   That's why he says, ask, seek and knock and it will be answered.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:58.100]   It will be given and it will be opened.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.700]   God is our answer.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:10.740]   So in this short verse reveals to us his whole life, how a schemer became a worshiper of
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.740]   God.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.620]   That's his story.
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.620]   That's your story.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.740]   And that's my story.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:21.340]   And this is why we need to watch and pray.
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.780]   Let's pray.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:32.940]   Again, as we invite our worship team to come, let's take a few minutes to pray before God.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:38.300]   Where are you in your walk with God?
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.260]   When's the last time you can honestly say that I wrestled with God?
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.940]   I'm contending with God.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.820]   This is just something that we just kind of prayer, something that we just kind of sprinkle
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.700]   on the things that we are doing.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.220]   And even though we say glory to God, but in the back of our minds, we're taking most of
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.780]   the credit.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.020]   Where's God?
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.940]   Let's take some time to really come before God.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:08.420]   And there might be tons of things that we don't understand.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:15.140]   They come before God, even that I don't understand Lord, but I believe in you.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.320]   So again, this morning to commit, to contend with God, that again, that the faith of Jacob
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.180]   will be reflected in our lives as well.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.040]   So let's pray.
