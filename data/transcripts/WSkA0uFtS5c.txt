[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:33.560]   - Well, we're now on the final day
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.320]   before Jesus heads to Calvary, to the cross.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.440]   And it's called the Passover day,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.240]   and this is the Thursday before Good Friday.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.280]   This is also called Maundy Thursday.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.480]   And we continue to see a deliberate nature
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.400]   of both Jesus's actions and his teachings.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.780]   There's a lot that happens on this final day,
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.880]   but we can break it up into three major chunks.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.940]   The first is that it's the season of the Passover.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.940]   The second is that there's this thing
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.000]   called the upper room discourse.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.840]   And third and finally, it's that Jesus prays
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.020]   in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.680]   These are the events that occur on this Thursday.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.580]   To look at the first, it's the season of the Passover.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.960]   We see a continuing theme of everything being preordained.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.380]   There's this room that's previously
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.100]   and deliberately prepared for Jesus and his disciples.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.580]   In this time, prophecy after prophecy
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.360]   is being fulfilled during this Passion Week.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.200]   And we see God's continuing deliberate action.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.160]   We saw this past Sunday that there's this donkey
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.780]   that was prepared for Jesus.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.180]   And we see that even in this last Passover meal,
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.360]   everything completely planned out.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.540]   If you could turn with me in your Bibles
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.540]   to Mark chapter 14 verse 12.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:19:02.080]   It says here in this text,
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.160]   "On the first day of unleavened bread,
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.720]   "when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.640]   "his disciples said to him,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.840]   "Where do you want us to go
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.740]   "and prepare for you to eat the Passover?
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.680]   "And he sent two of his disciples and said to them,
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.060]   "Go into the city, and a man will meet you
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.140]   "carrying a pitcher of water.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.600]   "Follow him, and wherever he enters,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.240]   "say to the owner of the house,
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.320]   "The teacher says, where is my guest room
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.420]   "in which I may eat the Passover with my disciples?
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.680]   "And he himself will show you a large upper room
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.300]   "furnished and ready.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.640]   "Prepare for us there.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.320]   "The disciples went out and came to the city
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.600]   "and found it just as he had told them,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.200]   "and they prepared the Passover."
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.720]   So everything here, Jesus knew.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   He knew the city.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.600]   He knew there was gonna be a man they would encounter.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.040]   He knew what the man would be doing.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.900]   He knew that this man would go back to another man
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.320]   who would have this room,
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.520]   an owner of a home that had this upper room
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.400]   prepared for them.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.160]   He knew that specifically,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.360]   this man would have prepared it
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.400]   for the Lord and his disciples.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.720]   And in verse 16 there, if you look at that again,
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.400]   it's a note of finality and definiteness.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.000]   "The disciples went out and came to the city
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.260]   "and found it just as he had told them."
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.840]   Not a thing missing from what he prophesied.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.080]   Jesus' knowledge wasn't vague.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.060]   It wasn't a vague, I'll die for sin.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.600]   It was actually quite detailed.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.240]   Everything he did was deliberate.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.920]   And we see this theme continuing to play out
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.560]   throughout the entirety of this week.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.160]   And into this Passover meal,
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.880]   which is now popularly called the Last Supper.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.360]   See, the room was not the only thing
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.680]   deliberately prepared for them.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.800]   That was only one scene or one cut
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.920]   or one little area, one day, that was prepared.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.220]   God has a plan for every minute detail.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.580]   Every scene falls under a sovereign and definite plan.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.560]   Even the entirety of the Passover,
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.600]   thousands of years running,
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.600]   has been deliberately prepared for the coming of this Jesus.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.500]   It's not simply that Jesus came to fulfill
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.360]   what God said would happen.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.080]   It's that Jesus was the whole and entire purpose
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.000]   of all of it.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.960]   And these signs were created in the past,
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.600]   impatient, waiting for Jesus to finally come.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.480]   Soon, the Passover meal, though,
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.720]   was something the Israelites simply did.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.320]   But every time, every year as the Passover came and went,
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.460]   it was completely created and purposed
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.920]   with the intention of waiting
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.120]   and preparing for the coming of the Messiah.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.500]   Tragically, the Jews are still practicing it today.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.840]   If you look at John 5:37, it says,
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.440]   "And the Father who sent me, he has testified of me.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.340]   "You have neither heard his voice at any time
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.960]   "nor seen his form.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.560]   "You do not have his word abiding in you,
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.540]   "for you do not believe him whom he sent."
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.100]   And here it is in verse 39,
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.320]   you search the scriptures because you think
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   that in them you have eternal life.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.240]   It is these that testify about me,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.840]   and you are unwilling to come to me
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.080]   so that you may have life.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.360]   If you hop down to verse 45, he continues,
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.740]   "Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.120]   "The one who accuses you is Moses,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.600]   "in whom you have set your hope.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.560]   "For if you believed Moses, you would believe me,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.040]   "for he wrote about me."
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.940]   He's saying all of these things written in scripture
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.560]   have been deliberately planned out for his coming.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.160]   And that included this Passover.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.960]   And what was this Passover?
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.560]   The Passover, as many of you may know,
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.120]   was an event that occurred during the days of Moses
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.740]   and the Egyptian pharaoh.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.600]   Yahweh God was on his way to freeing his people from Egypt,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.680]   and he used these 10 plagues to force his hand.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.040]   In the 10th and final plague,
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.560]   God sent an angel of death to kill every firstborn,
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.880]   that's important, every firstborn son of Egypt.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.700]   However, he commanded the Israelites
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.060]   to do something on that evening.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.920]   He would not simply spare the Israelites' firstborn sons.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.620]   He told them, "You would have to slaughter
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.240]   "a one-year-old male lamb for each household,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.840]   "and paint the blood of that lamb
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.080]   "over the doorposts of the house."
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.080]   And in this way, if for those who followed that command,
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.160]   for those who placed their faith in what he was saying,
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.740]   the angel of death would pass over their house,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.480]   hence the name Passover.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.680]   In Exodus 12, verse four,
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.580]   he includes an interesting detail regarding this Passover.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.080]   "Now if the household is too small for a lamb,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.760]   "then he and his neighbor nearest to his house
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.380]   "are to take one according to the number of persons in them.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.020]   "According to what each man should eat,
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.480]   "you are to divide the lamb."
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.560]   See, this lamb was important not only for the blood
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.300]   that was supposed to be displayed or painted
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.160]   over the doorposts of the house,
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.360]   but the flesh of the lamb must also be consumed
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.680]   by the individuals.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.420]   And in it, God's wrath would pass over those individuals
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.160]   who had both the flesh and the blood of the lamb
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.120]   covering over them.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.980]   You see, for thousands of years,
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.560]   Jews had been practicing this tradition.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.960]   The slaughtering of lambs and goats and animals
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.100]   during these holidays and festivals
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.200]   were incredible to think about.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.840]   See, countless animals were slaughtered
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.800]   over thousands of years.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.400]   And with this in mind, Jesus institutes
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.840]   what we now know as the first communion,
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.420]   which was the Last Supper.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.600]   This is what the disciples would have been thinking
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.240]   when they thought over the Passover meal.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.720]   They would think about the time in Egypt.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.640]   They would think about the angel of death
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.120]   and the blood of the lamb
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.100]   and the eating of this slaughtered lamb.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.780]   And Jesus, just like he has been saying about so many things,
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.340]   even on Sundays, as we've been looking
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.560]   over the I Am statements,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.420]   Jesus is saying, it's not the bread, it's not the water,
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.020]   it's not these signs that you see, but it's me.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.580]   He says, I'm the point of it all.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.120]   And the same with the Passover.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.160]   He's saying the Passover was about me.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.060]   There is now no need for the Passover meal,
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.640]   for I have come.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.620]   There is no more looking at the shadow,
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.000]   the substance is here.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.820]   There is no more looking at the sign, he is here.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.520]   He's saying to everybody, I've arrived.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.660]   After thousands of years of waiting, he's saying, here I am.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.060]   And so in Mark 14, 22, on this Passover night,
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.740]   it says in scripture, while they were eating,
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.980]   he took some bread and after a blessing,
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.540]   he broke it and gave it to them and said, take it.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.140]   This is my body.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.340]   And when he had taken a cup and given thanks,
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.220]   he gave it to them and they all drank from it
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.540]   and he said to them, this is my blood of the covenant,
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.160]   which is poured out for many.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.900]   It mimics the Passover.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.680]   He says, eat my body, drink my blood.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:09.340]   He is here to be the final Passover lamb.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.820]   None of the Passover lambs in the past
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.900]   was actually something that would save them.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.940]   It was all to point to him, the only one who could save.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.180]   And that is why John the Baptist,
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.060]   when he first saw Jesus, he said,
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.540]   behold the lamb of God who takes away
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.580]   the sins of the world.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.260]   This brings us to our second part of this evening,
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.780]   the upper room discourse.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.060]   Now this upper room is where they've been sharing
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.860]   in this last supper.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.940]   This upper room discourse is happening concurrently
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.260]   with this meal.
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.860]   So it's all wrapped up together.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.620]   And the teaching he does with his disciples
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.920]   in this upper room points to himself again.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.180]   If you could turn with me to John chapter 13.
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:57.580]   Very familiar passage, but it's important to remember
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.440]   that this is during the same time as this last supper,
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.860]   the day before he would die.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.160]   In John 13 three, Jesus, knowing that the father
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.480]   had given all things into his hands,
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.080]   and that he had come forth from God
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.560]   and was going back to God,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.400]   got up from supper and laid aside his garments
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.520]   and making a towel, he girded himself.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.840]   Then he poured water into the basin
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.720]   and began to wash the disciples' feet
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.960]   and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.920]   So he came to Simon Peter.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.240]   He said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.680]   And Jesus answered and said to him,
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.920]   what I do you do not realize now,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.600]   but you will understand hereafter.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.840]   Peter said to him, never shall you wash my feet.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.280]   Jesus answered him, if I do not wash you,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.260]   you have no part with me.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:55.580]   Simon Peter said to him, Lord, then wash not only my feet,
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.760]   but also my hands and my head.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.080]   And Jesus said to him, he who has bathed
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.600]   needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.320]   And you are clean, but not all of you.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.320]   Jumping down to verse 12.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.120]   So when he had washed their feet and taken his garments
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.520]   and reclined at the table again, he said to them,
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.040]   do you know what I have done to you?
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.760]   You call me teacher and Lord,
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.900]   and you are right, for so I am.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:27.000]   If I then, the Lord and the teacher, washed your feet,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.520]   you also ought to wash one another's feet.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.520]   For I gave you an example that you also should do
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.980]   as I did to you.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.120]   But Jesus is setting this example for them.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.720]   He's saying, I am your teacher, I am your Lord,
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.000]   and yet I am stooping down, humbly washing your feet,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.800]   doing the action of a slave.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.080]   What we see in John 13, we have to remember,
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.240]   we can't get lost staring at the sign.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.440]   We have to stare at Christ here.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.040]   We can't be staring at the pointing finger,
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.320]   we have to stare at what it's pointing at.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.840]   The significance of the feet washing will be realized
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.180]   only after Jesus dies for them.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.000]   Remember what Jesus says in John 13, eight.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.800]   He says, if I don't wash you, you have no part with me.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.360]   He's not talking about the washing of their feet.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.220]   Jesus is showing that he must cleanse them of their sins,
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.400]   or they can't be with him.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.960]   This isn't a sermon illustration
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.360]   of how we must serve one another.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.120]   This is a picture of only what Jesus could do for us.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.920]   This is a picture of only what can be described
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.340]   as the creator kneeling before creation.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.600]   That the Lord Jesus himself would kneel down
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.520]   before the people serving them.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.760]   In Philippians chapter two, verses five through eight,
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.080]   remember this image.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.600]   Have this attitude in yourselves,
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.280]   which was also in Christ Jesus,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.920]   who although he existed in the form of God,
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.820]   did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.980]   but emptied himself, taking the form of a bond servant,
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.180]   being made in the likeness of men
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.960]   and being found in appearance as a man,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.820]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.420]   to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.500]   The picture being burned into the memories
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.060]   of these disciples is their master kneeling down
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.460]   to do the work of a slave.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.500]   And this picture was what was extravagant enough,
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:35.620]   but what it points at is infinitely more extravagant.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.260]   We stare at what Jesus is trying to portray here,
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.660]   what he's trying to depict,
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.820]   that even here in fulfilling the Passover
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.800]   and instituting this Lord's Supper,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.580]   the first communion, he continues to point
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.260]   to what he will do, to show exactly
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.420]   what he was going to do the very next day.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:00.820]   Remember the words of Matthew and Mark,
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.060]   the son of man came not to be served, but to serve.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.340]   That's great, but the next part is so much
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.180]   more important than that.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.100]   To give his life as a ransom for many,
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.900]   it describes how his service looked.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.860]   To lay down his life, he came not to be served,
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:20.020]   but to serve, that's how he serves.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:26.580]   Remember what John says later in 1 John 3.16,
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:30.340]   we know, loved by this, that he laid down his life for us
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.620]   and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.220]   That's the example portion.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:40.420]   So in John 13.34, when he says in this upper room discourse,
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.300]   a new commandment I give to you,
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.100]   which is where we get the word mandi, that means command,
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.080]   a new commandment I give to you, that you love one another,
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.140]   even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.540]   By this, all men will know that you are my disciples
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.180]   if you have love for one another.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.300]   We don't stare at the directive,
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.920]   we ought to love one another.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.920]   We stare at our Lord and Savior, our God, our King,
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.960]   our Maker, the creator Jesus Christ,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.360]   on his knees, washing our feet,
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.220]   showing us how he will in just a few days die,
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.640]   resurrect so that we might have life.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.240]   This was God in heaven, born in the form of a servant
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.280]   as a man, dying the criminal's death on the cross,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.960]   complete humility, complete degradation,
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.220]   and a debasement, saying that he would take our place.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.340]   The point wasn't that he washed their feet.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.700]   The point is that he washed us of our sin.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:47.480]   And he as God was stooping before these disciples
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.440]   in unthinkable humility.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.120]   Simon Peter bursts up at that and says,
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.820]   "You can't wash my feet."
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.260]   He did so much more.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.740]   This was the Passover lamb giving himself,
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.160]   laying down his life.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.320]   In the middle of this discourse,
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.780]   do you know what the disciples were fighting over?
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.440]   They were fighting over who would get to sit
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.900]   in the place of honor and exaltation.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.240]   And here's Jesus stooping and kneeling.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.000]   And so with his heart set, Jesus prays
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.480]   the high priestly prayer,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.360]   intentionally in front of his disciples,
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.320]   which we see in John 14 through 17.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.120]   And then Jesus gets up,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.360]   and with his disciples they head
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.560]   to the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.740]   now numbering only 11 of them,
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.800]   as Pastor Peter talked about Judas last night, who left.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.680]   This brings us to our third point,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.880]   in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.580]   this last part of Thursday,
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.840]   as deliberate as everything has been
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.620]   in Jesus' life to this point,
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.140]   Jesus goes into this garden to pray.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.600]   And it's a reminder that Jesus was human.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.040]   He felt the strong pains of temptation
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   and desires to perhaps live for himself.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.900]   That was probably still there.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.240]   He had every reason to sit there and say,
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.280]   why must I do this?
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.560]   For people who are undeserving,
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.980]   for people who are enemies,
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.360]   for people who are Judas-like,
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.600]   as we learned last night.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.980]   To escape what was awaiting him,
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.260]   there was no reason.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:19.640]   Jesus walks over to the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.560]   where there are groves of olive trees.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.080]   Gethsemane means olive press.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.680]   And here he leaves eight disciples
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.840]   at the entrance of the garden,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.600]   and he heads in with three of them.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.000]   It's Peter, James, and John.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.740]   And he leaves Peter, James, and John to pray,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.960]   and he goes a little bit deeper into the garden
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.180]   to pray alone.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:43.080]   We see this in Matthew 26, if you could turn there.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.320]   Matthew chapter 26, verse 36.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:50.360]   And it says there,
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.560]   "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.240]   And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.840]   and began to be grieved and distressed.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.680]   Then he said to them,
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.320]   "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.920]   "Remain here and keep watch with me."
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.200]   And he went a little beyond them,
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.440]   and fell on his face and prayed, saying,
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.800]   "My father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.640]   "Yet not as I will, but as you will."
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.320]   You know the story.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.440]   I mean, Jesus was grieved, and he was distressed.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.960]   This is someone who is alarmed,
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.540]   someone who has a heart that's heavy and weighty.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.080]   Jesus was full of fear and trepidation here.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:39.560]   I mean, this is Jesus who has never really feared anything.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.960]   He could look at the winds and the waves
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.700]   in the middle of a storm in the Mediterranean,
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.560]   without fear.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.480]   Someone who could stare down a disease,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.960]   someone who could look at death and bring to life,
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.280]   someone not afraid to go against the religious leaders.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.980]   And here he is, in the middle of this garden,
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:05.100]   deeply, deeply distressed, alone,
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:10.140]   in a pit, in darkness, with the walls closing around him,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.720]   about to face an eternal, mountainous wrath of God,
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.380]   unleashed upon him.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.960]   I mean, I remember what it was like to fear hell.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.440]   And I no longer need to feel that fear any longer.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.200]   But here is my Lord and my Savior,
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.640]   just in deep distress,
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.880]   looking down the barrel of God's wrath.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:41.320]   So he asked Peter and James and John to pray with him,
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.040]   as he goes deeper into the garden.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.940]   And he took these three,
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.280]   because perhaps he had more intimate relationships with them.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.560]   I think that these three
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.720]   were actually the leaders of the disciples.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   And we know what happens next.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.160]   Three times, Jesus asks God for something.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.600]   And each time, he comes back to see
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.680]   that they'd fallen asleep in prayer.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.720]   And this might have been up to three hours
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.560]   of agonizing prayer for Christ.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.520]   At this point, we might conclude that God the Father
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.420]   was silent at Jesus' prayers and pleas.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.960]   Maybe that's why Jesus repeats this prayer three times.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.900]   Well, in Matthew 26, verse 39,
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.220]   if you look a little further,
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.720]   we see his first request, in verse 39.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.520]   My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me,
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.020]   yet not as I will, but as you will.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.760]   This is his plea.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.500]   But in his second request, it's very enlightening.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.680]   In verse 42, plea number two.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.760]   My Father, this cannot pass away unless I drink it.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.320]   Your will be done.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.600]   Is Jesus asking the Father
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.560]   to stop this from actually occurring?
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.640]   Is he asking God the Father to stop him
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.720]   from being crucified and to stop him
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.400]   from drinking every drop of the wrath of God?
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:02.240]   Jesus knows what he's there for.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.920]   He knows what he's going to do.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.760]   His entire human life has been leading
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.920]   deliberately to this point.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.800]   All of human history has been pointing
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.640]   to this instance in history.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.080]   His prayer all night long was his passionate plea,
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.720]   found in his present distress,
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.940]   followed though by this resolve.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.160]   Let your will be done.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.660]   The Son's will was always the Father's will.
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.280]   They were one and the same.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.120]   Jesus did not live his life for himself.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.340]   He lived his entire life to be a sacrifice for others.
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.320]   He would give his life so that others may find life.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.480]   And we see what the writer of Hebrews says
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.960]   about Jesus' prayer in the garden.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.560]   I think that's what it's pointing to.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.080]   In Hebrews chapter five, verse seven,
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.720]   in the days of his flesh,
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.740]   Jesus, or he offered up both prayers and supplications
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.520]   with loud crying and tears to the one
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.400]   able to save him from death.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.640]   And he was heard because of his piety.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.520]   I think that the Father definitely heard Jesus.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.520]   We get another glimpse in the differing account.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.680]   Matthew and Mark look similar,
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.560]   but Luke's account looks a little different.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.440]   There's a one little thing that comes out
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.720]   in Luke 22, verse 42.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.920]   Here's the account in Luke.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.160]   Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me,
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.640]   yet not my will, but yours be done.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.600]   And then in verse 43,
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.360]   now an angel from heaven appeared to him,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.440]   strengthening him.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.840]   Being in agony, he was praying very fervently,
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.080]   and his sweat became like drops of blood
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.960]   falling down upon the ground.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.520]   See, the Father heard his Son.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.400]   But like it says in Isaiah 53, four, of Jesus,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.720]   the Father's will and the Son's will were in alignment.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.200]   They knew what the job was here.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.800]   They knew what the mission was here.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   In Isaiah 53, four, surely our griefs he himself bore,
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.520]   and our sorrows he carried.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.960]   Yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.400]   smitten of God, and afflicted.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.080]   And then in verse 10,
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.360]   but the Lord was pleased to crush him,
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.320]   putting him to grief.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.680]   If he would render himself as a guilt offering.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.920]   It says that Jesus is in grief.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.160]   It says that Jesus is distressed.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.000]   It says that he is so distressed
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.720]   that he is sweating and crying blood.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.600]   He bore our griefs.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.800]   He carried our sorrows.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:42.080]   God crushed him, putting him to grief.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.200]   The Father heard,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.640]   yet the Father and Son had the same will this evening.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.960]   They knew what the end was.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.480]   It was to fulfill the Passover
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.720]   that we might have death pass over us
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.040]   with the body and the blood of the Son given for us.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.280]   It was to fulfill a Christ act of service and love
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.000]   that the one true creator,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.320]   that the one true God who made all of the world,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.720]   the Lord and the King,
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.000]   the exalted one, the majestic,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.480]   that he would give himself for humanity,
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.040]   to stoop down in humility,
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   that in his service we might be washed of sin,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.520]   that he would taste death so that we would not have to.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.880]   So tomorrow we'll see a time
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.440]   where Jesus cries out on the cross,
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.040]   "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.800]   As he drinks every drop of that cup.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.760]   But tonight is not that time.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.960]   Tonight in this incredible grief and distress
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.080]   and anguish that we see with Jesus,
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.760]   he knew what he must do.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.400]   Jesus was resolute, he was convicted,
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.160]   and even in the silence of that garden,
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.520]   an angel came to strengthen him
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.680]   with resolve to know what he came here to do deliberately.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.520]   Let's pray.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.120]   Heavenly Father,
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.840]   I pray that as we are now right at the precipice
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.960]   of Good Friday,
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.000]   that we see what Jesus had been doing.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Oh, Father, thank you.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.960]   Thank you for our wonderful Savior.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.560]   Thank you, God, that he did not have to walk this path
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.120]   and yet he had every intention to do this.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.400]   That he walked deliberately,
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.240]   with purpose and with conviction.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.760]   And as we see in Hebrews 12 too,
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.360]   that he did it for the joy laid before him.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.280]   Oh, Father, there is no one like you.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.720]   We worship you with all our hearts.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.120]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.600]   (gentle music)

[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.220]   Father, we thank you for just your word tonight.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:32.800]   And we thank you God for praying on our behalf
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.640]   in that garden.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:39.960]   We pray that tomorrow, as we reflect
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:44.600]   this on your death on the cross,
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:49.160]   Father, that this would not just be religious fact for us,
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:53.480]   but the fact that it would break us,
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:59.760]   humble us,
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:08.920]   and cause us to bow our knee,
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.200]   to lift your name on us.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:17.800]   We confess, God, that there was no other way.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   And we are thankful, Lord Jesus, for your obedience.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:30.480]   We pray that the whole of our lives
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.040]   would be submitted to your lordship,
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.600]   because you indeed are worthy.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.280]   Thank you for this evening.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.760]   Pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.640]   See you tomorrow.
