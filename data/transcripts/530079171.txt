[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.400]   Hi, my name is Young Hei, and I'm married to Tim for about 13 years.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.800]   We have three boys, age 10, 7, and 1.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.640]   You guys might know them as Jordan, Jacoby, and Jude.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.480]   We moved to California from New York about six years ago and have been coming to Berean
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.340]   since November of 2019, a couple months before the pandemic.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.000]   To share a little bit about my testimony, I was infant baptized and grew up going to
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.320]   church with my family.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.000]   Though outwardly I was attending church and serving a youth group every Sunday, inwardly
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.120]   I was living a very self-centered and people-centered life.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.040]   My heart was embittered towards my parents, and I lived primarily for the approval of
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.040]   man.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.120]   I knew about God in my head and learned about the do's and don'ts of Christianity, but
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.160]   it didn't have a lasting impact in my daily life, thoughts, or actions.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.120]   When I was a sophomore in college, I attended a college conference, and it was during that
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.240]   prayer time when I finally understood the power of the gospel.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.080]   For the first time, I came face to face with my own depravity and sins, and God slowly
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.360]   began to reveal the heart and heart, as well as all the sins of self-righteousness, bitterness,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.720]   pride, and all of the false idols that I had been living for.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:59.640]   That time of confession was not only humbling, but emotionally overwhelming, as I recognized
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.520]   the power of the cross and Jesus' sacrifice for me.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:26.360]   Experiencing His love and forgiveness was what freed me from bitterness and enabled
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.760]   me to love and forgive others.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.160]   Rather than trying to live for the approval and purposes of man, I was now excited to
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   live for His kingdom purpose.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.440]   That was the year when I laid down my life and turned to Christ as my personal Savior
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.160]   and Lord.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.040]   Over the past eight years, it's been quite a faith journey and adventure for our family.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:02.920]   There's been so many transitions from career to church, to moving from New Jersey to Boston
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.680]   to Florida, and now to California.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.760]   But in the midst of continual transitions and trials, I'm holding on to the promises
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.360]   of God, and I look forward to starting and sharing life together with this Berean family.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.760]   I'll close with this verse from Romans 6, verse 4.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.600]   It says, "We were buried, therefore, with Him by baptism into death, in order that,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.680]   just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.360]   in newness of life."
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   Thank you.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   [applause]
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   [ Applause ]
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   [ Pause ]
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   >> Do you understand when you go into the water, you're united with Christ and his death
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   and you are being united with his resurrected life when you come out?
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   >> I do.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   >> I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   [ Applause ]
