[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   I'm going to be on this text, but I want to read this this morning before we get started.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:17.400]   Isaiah chapter 9, verse 6 and 7.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.520]   And then we'll jump into the message this morning.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.040]   Isaiah chapter 9, verse 6 through 7.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.680]   For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.880]   shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.320]   Prince of Peace.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.720]   And on the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish it and to uphold it with justice
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.080]   and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore, the zeal of the Lord of hosts
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080]   will do this.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.080]   Amen.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.080]   Amen.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.080]   Let's pray.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.680]   Father, we want to praise you and thank you.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.520]   That even as we prepare for the various things that we'll be doing with our families, with
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.600]   the busy season of exchanging gifts, vacations, rest, that in the midst of all of this, help
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.960]   us to remember what we are truly celebrating, that you've sacrificed your only begotten
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.920]   Son to live on this earth, Lord God, in suffering, humbled.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.920]   I pray that you would help us to understand the meaning behind all of this, Lord.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.760]   That we would grow in appreciation, that we would be men and women who worship you genuinely
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   from our hearts.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.280]   We ask that you would anoint this morning for the sake of your name.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280]   Amen.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.840]   Again, as you guys know, Christmas every year we celebrate the coming of our Savior, Jesus
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.440]   Christ.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   And as the gospels represent him and teach us that he is the King of kings and Lord of
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440]   lords.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.560]   So when we think about the coming of the King, we celebrate the coming of the King because
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.860]   the King comes to establish his kingdom.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.560]   So it's not just about Jesus himself, but why he came.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.900]   Not simply because he came as an infant child born in a manger with all these things we
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.600]   sing about and we view and we have time with our children, but in the end, the King came
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.680]   in order to establish his kingdom.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.840]   The kingdom that Jesus brought is filled with paradoxes because it is against so much of
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.880]   what we understand the world believes in and teaches.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.280]   And nowhere is that more clear when we see it in the Beatitudes in Matthew chapter 5.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.640]   Matthew chapter 5 through chapter 7 is what we call the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.800]   And Sermon on the Mount basically is Jesus describing what the kingdom of heaven is like.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.920]   And so you'll see that phrase over and over again repeated in his teaching.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.240]   The kingdom of heaven is like this.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.040]   The kingdom of heaven is like that.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.760]   But before he even gets into the core of his message, he begins the message by saying,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.160]   blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.680]   So every one of these Beatitudes are things that have flipped our worldview completely
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.000]   upside down because we don't normally think that those who are poor in spirit are the
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.080]   ones who are blessed.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.880]   In fact, oftentimes when we are poor in spirit, we seek God and say, what did I do wrong?
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.640]   Maybe if I did this, maybe there's some sin in my life.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.720]   But instead, Jesus turns that upside down and says, no, blessed are those who are poor.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.920]   Blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.360]   Not those who are rejoicing, not those who is nothing is going wrong in their life, but
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   those who mourn because he himself will come in comfort.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.760]   Blessed are those who are meek for they shall inherit the earth.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.800]   Not the go-getters, not the CEOs, but those who are meek.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.560]   Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be satisfied.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.400]   I'm not going to go through all of them, but if you look at the Beatitudes, every part
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.720]   of the Beatitudes flips the world values completely upside down.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.840]   And this is the paradox of God's kingdom that though we live in the world who teaches the
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.120]   opposite of the Beatitudes, that his kingdom has come to establish his kingdom within the
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.040]   church a completely different set of rules and set of values.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.680]   And that's what Christmas ultimately is about.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.460]   It's not simply about Jesus Christ coming.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.460]   It's about him coming to establish his kingdom.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.480]   Jesus in his teaching repeatedly said, it is those who are the weakest in the kingdom,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.200]   those who serve are those who are the greatest in the kingdom of God.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.920]   In fact, there's nothing more paradoxical than when he says, if you want to live, you
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.080]   must, what, die.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   I mean, that pretty much sums up everything that he says.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.880]   If you want to live, you must die.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.000]   Think about it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.040]   Since the day we are born, those of you who have children, when you have infants coming
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.800]   out of the mother's womb, the first thing that they do is they open their eyes, they
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.640]   begin to cry.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.240]   And some babies immediately begin to suck.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.200]   They know how to eat.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:34.640]   The instinct to live, to survive, for self-preservation is innate in us from the day that we are born.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.480]   And yet Jesus says, if you really truly want to live, you must learn how to die to yourself.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   So the kingdom of God is filled with paradoxes.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.240]   Again, as I mentioned last week, we have to be careful that we don't apply the kingdom,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.200]   the worldly principles into his kingdom because it is completely the opposite.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.880]   And that's why Paul tells us in Romans chapter 12 not to be conformed but to be transformed
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.080]   by the renewing of our mind.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.280]   But of all the paradoxes that we see in his kingdom and of his teaching, there is nothing
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.360]   more paradoxical than what you and I celebrate today.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:20.120]   Jesus Christ himself, his very presence, that he walked with us, he was born into this world,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.080]   is a paradox above all the other paradoxes because his name, according to Isaiah 714,
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.920]   is Immanuel.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.440]   And the word Immanuel simply means God with us.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.040]   It was prophesied in Isaiah 714 that therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.400]   Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.480]   This prophecy was given 750 plus years before Jesus ever showed up.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.720]   Today and tomorrow is a day that we remember Christ coming.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.120]   Matthew 123, the angel says, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.600]   shall call his name Immanuel," which means God with us.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.360]   God with us.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.400]   Some theologians will actually say that the greatest of all the miracles that you and
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.800]   I celebrate is this incarnation of Christ.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.920]   We often talk about the resurrection.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.760]   And again, that's another huge Christian holiday that we celebrate and we want to make sure
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.320]   that the gospel goes out.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.800]   You know, in our church, we take a whole week doing morning devotions and early morning
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.680]   service and Friday night.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.580]   And so it is a big deal because Jesus said he was going to leave one sign of his resurrection.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:41.420]   But many theologians believe that all of that really hinges upon your belief in the incarnation
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.420]   of Christ.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.780]   In fact, J.I. Packer says this in his book, Knowing God, "God became man, the divine son
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.800]   became a Jew, the Almighty appeared on earth as a helpless human baby, unable to do more
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.960]   than lie and stare and wriggle and make noises, needing to be fed and changed and taught to
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.400]   talk like any other child.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.420]   The babyhood of the son of God was a reality.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.460]   The more you think about it, the more staggering it gets.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:17.100]   Nothing in fiction is so fantastic as is this truth of the incarnation."
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.880]   Tim Keller in his book called The Hidden Christmas says this, "Some have argued that the supreme
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.780]   miracle of Christianity is not the resurrection of Christ from the dead, but the incarnation.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.080]   The beginningless, omnipotent creator of the universe took on a human nature without the
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:40.400]   loss of his deity so that Jesus, the son of Joseph of Nazareth, was both fully divine
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.540]   and fully human.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:47.420]   Of all the things that Christianity proclaims, this is the most staggering.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.900]   That God of the universe took on human form."
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.260]   If you've ever held a child, even if you are not a mother or father, and if you've been
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.780]   around an infant child, you know how fragile they are.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:07.580]   I remember the very first time when the doctor handed the baby over to me, I remember very
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.380]   distinctly my dad would always say, "Peter, whatever you touch, you break because I'm
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.380]   not gentle."
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:23.220]   Whether it was an instrument or whatever in the home, if it falls in my hands, it'll break.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.140]   I'm not the type of person to be nurturing, and so I just wanted to see how far is this
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.700]   thing going to bend.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.020]   That's usually my mentality.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.980]   It was so distinct to me when the doctor gave my first child into my hands, my dad's voice
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.660]   was ringing in my head, "Don't break him.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.660]   Don't break him."
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.380]   He's a human being.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.420]   That's how fragile a baby is.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:54.620]   To think that the God who created the universe took on human form, not as Samson, not as
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.220]   a mighty warrior, but an infant child.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.500]   In Colossians 1, 16, 17, "For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.260]   and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authority, all things were created
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.340]   through him and for him."
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:17.540]   So think about who Jesus is that we are celebrating.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.540]   Everything that you and I see, everything that you and I know, the very reason why you
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:27.100]   and I even have air to breathe is because Jesus is sustaining all things.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.860]   He created all things, all authority, all dominion, all power in heaven and on earth
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.500]   was created by Jesus himself.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:42.580]   And yet the scripture says that he came as a fragile baby, an infant.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:48.700]   The almighty powerful God became an infant needing help.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:55.980]   Again, if you've ever had a little child, and I was there with many of our young families
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.260]   who had children, and I remember sometimes getting phone calls from young parents not
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.340]   knowing if what they're doing is right or wrong, and I'm not going to expose some of
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.060]   you, and getting phone calls.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.740]   And I remember opening up the diaper and asking, "Is this okay?"
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:20.700]   And I'd see their little tiny butts all scratched up because the parents were wiping too hard.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.420]   And I remember saying, "Don't do that.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.420]   You're going to break him."
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.980]   The same advice my dad gave me, I gave to some of you guys.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.940]   How fragile this human being is.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:37.700]   And yet Jesus took on that form.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.500]   Not only was he a child, he didn't come to a royal family.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:49.020]   To a teenage girl who had access to almost no resources.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.140]   To the father who was a lonely carpenter who didn't have the resources to raise him up
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.820]   in a comfortable home.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.820]   In a city called Nazareth, where people believe that there's no access.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.860]   If you want to become somebody of great stature, you can't be from Nazareth.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.580]   I mean, it's not like today in the United States where you can just simply move and
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.100]   go somewhere else and seek out other opportunities.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.900]   Wherever you were born, that's probably where you're going to die.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.140]   You don't really have much access to improve your life.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:23.060]   So Jesus was born in Nazareth from a very ordinary background.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.580]   In fact, less than ordinary.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:33.540]   The Bible describes him in Isaiah 53, 2-3, "For he who grew up before him like a young
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:39.560]   plant and like a root out of a dry ground, he had no form of majesty that we should look
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.980]   at him and no beauty that we should desire him.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.300]   He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:56.020]   And as one from whom men hide their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not."
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:03.740]   We can understand why the early Jews had such a hard time understanding who Jesus was.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:12.620]   Because they spent hundreds, thousands of years worshipping God the creator.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.420]   He's the one who delivered them from Egypt.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.980]   They worshipped him day in and day out.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.700]   And so when Jesus came, he didn't simply say, "I'm your Messiah."
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.960]   Jesus said that he was God.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.540]   He said he was that God who created the universe, that all things are sustained by him.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.800]   He was that God.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.860]   He said before Moses, "I am."
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:39.980]   He made it very clear that he wasn't just a messenger of God, but he himself was God.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.940]   And that's why the Jews picked up stones and said, "We are stoning you not because of the
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.420]   miracles that you're performing, but because you, a mere man, claim to be God."
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.220]   They understood exactly what he was saying.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.780]   As a result of that, in John 9-11, it says, "The true light which enlightened everyone
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.140]   was coming into the world.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.580]   He was in the world and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.900]   He came to his own and his own people did not receive him."
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:17.580]   Before we judge the early Jews, we can understand, humanly speaking, how can this fragile baby,
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:24.580]   how can this child of Joseph, the carpenter from Nazareth, he walked with us, he went
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.740]   to school with us.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.140]   We've seen him get tired and go to sleep.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.480]   He had to learn like we had to learn.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.500]   He had human relations.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.500]   He had a mother.
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.500]   He had a father.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.580]   In fact, his very first miracle in ministry was a very mundane miracle.
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:49.300]   He just turned water into wine because the mother was concerned that the host was going
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.300]   to get embarrassed.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.160]   So, he calls Jesus and says, "Hey, can you help out?
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.900]   Can you turn this water into wine?"
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:03.700]   So, his very first miracle was just very mundane, something that would happen in any marriage.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.980]   How can this be the Son of God?
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.900]   But that part in and of itself, as difficult as that is to understand, as paradoxical as
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:22.700]   that is, it is the nature of our God, not simply his power, but his very nature that
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.940]   makes it very difficult to understand.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.140]   How could he come as a human being?
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:34.820]   Revelation chapter 6, where Isaiah is being called into ministry and God allows him to
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:41.460]   see a glimpse of the glory of God in his throne, and the creatures are surrounding the throne
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.940]   proclaiming, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord."
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.340]   The word holy literally simply means to be set apart.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:57.620]   He's separate in every way, in his nature, in his power, in his moral righteousness,
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:03.260]   in every aspect of who God is, he is completely separate.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:09.420]   An application of the word holy basically means that God, that the Jews worshipped,
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.180]   was completely unapproachable.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:18.220]   And if you've ever studied through the Old Testament, you'll see that every aspect of
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.780]   Jewish history, every aspect of the tabernacle, the temple worship, the sacrifices, every
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:30.380]   part of that reminded the nation of Israel that you cannot simply come to me with sinful
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.300]   hands and sinful eyes and sinful mouth.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:38.500]   Moses, desiring to see the glory of God, said, "If you would just give me a glimpse, if you're
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:44.740]   going to ask me to lead the nation of Israel through this desert, let me see who you are."
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:53.780]   And God repeated to him, "Any man who sees me will surely die, but I will show you a
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.100]   glimpse of me because that's about all you can handle."
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:02.900]   So God gave him a glimpse, a small portion of his glory as he was passing by, and even
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:08.180]   that he had to protect Moses from his full glory or else he would die.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:13.100]   Moses, just a reflection of God's glory, came down and people, when they saw the reflection
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.580]   of God's glory on his face, were so fearful.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.340]   They asked Moses, "Could you please go into the tent so we don't have to look at your
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.340]   face?"
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.900]   Because they were terrified by the presence of God.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:32.940]   Every part of God's nature said it was completely unapproachable.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:40.380]   Isaiah's response when he saw God's glory was to face down on the floor, "Woe is me,
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.380]   woe is me.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.380]   I am ruined.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.180]   I am going to die."
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:52.820]   He saw God's glory and he recognized immediately what was going to happen to him.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:18:00.300]   Nadab and Abihu, the first two priests who represented the sins of Israel, they experienced
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:06.780]   capital punishment because they didn't take God's rule seriously and they decided to offer
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:12.340]   up sacrifice, whatever they saw fit, and God punished them as a result of that.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:19.700]   In fact, Israelites were so afraid to even say his name wrong that they would say it
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:26.060]   in a way that would bring judgment upon them, that they would never even say his name Yahweh.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.900]   So if you look at the Old Testament, every instance where the Hebrew Bible has the word
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.140]   Yahweh, they actually put the word Adonai.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.340]   So the way you're going to know that is you go to the Old Testament and if it is spelled
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:43.740]   out capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D, it means that the Hebrew Bible actually
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.700]   has the word Yahweh in it.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:52.420]   But the Jews were so afraid to even say his name and get it wrong and to incur punishment
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.940]   upon them that they wouldn't even say his name.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:59.780]   In fact, part of the reason why we're not even sure today whether his name should be
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.860]   pronounced Yahweh or Yehoah is because they lost how to say it.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:13.780]   Because the Hebrew language, at least at that time, didn't have vowels, so they only have
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.380]   consonants.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:21.020]   So we're not exactly sure today whether it should be pronounced Yehoah or Yahweh because
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.780]   the Jews just didn't say it.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.500]   They just called him Adonai.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.660]   That's who Jesus was.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.660]   It is that God.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:37.660]   How can that God that they couldn't even look at, that they couldn't approach, the glimpse
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:45.020]   of his glory brought fear to the nation of Israel, be in that manger?
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.140]   How can it be that child?
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:57.460]   See, Christmas is a day that we celebrate the holy, holy, holy God dwelling among us.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:07.260]   If we truly understood who it is that we are celebrating, our natural response wouldn't
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:14.660]   be, "Let's celebrate Jesus," like make a little manger, give gifts to each other, drink eggnog,
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.780]   and have Christmas party.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:22.300]   Our natural response is what we would see in Revelation chapter 6, 15 to 16.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:29.980]   In Revelation chapter 6, 15 to 16, it describes the coming of Jesus a second time.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:35.740]   And in his second coming, he says Jesus does not come as a child.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.100]   He doesn't come as a humbled servant.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.900]   He will come in his full glory.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.340]   And when Jesus comes in his full glory, the response in verse 15 and 16 is that people
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:49.420]   hide in terror and they run up to the mountains hiding under rocks because they see his glory
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.780]   coming.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:58.540]   And their response is the same response that the Jews had whenever they saw his glory.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.060]   So what is strange is not what's happening in Revelation.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.420]   What is strange is not what's happening in the Old Testament.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.660]   What is strange is what we are celebrating today.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:17.580]   That God, that holy, holy, holy God that in his wrath and anger wiped out the human race,
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:24.300]   that holy, holy, holy God that you couldn't even enter the holy of holies where he dwelt,
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:32.060]   only the most, the high priest of Israel once a year just goes in and just spends a brief
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.020]   moment, does his job and comes out.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.620]   That everybody that we know in the Old Testament who even saw a glimpse of his glory fell down
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.620]   in terror.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:48.180]   It's that God, it's that same God who will come in his full glory in the book of Revelation.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.860]   So how do we understand?
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:58.700]   We understand Revelation because it's consistent with what we see of God in the Old Testament.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.220]   But how do we understand Jesus of the Gospel?
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.900]   How do we understand Jesus of the New Testament?
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:15.820]   See, the scripture says that when Jesus came, he stepped down from his glory, Philippians
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.140]   2.6.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:23.420]   Jesus though he was in form God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.420]   made himself nothing.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.580]   Taken the form of a servant, being born in likeness of man.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.980]   The only reason why you and I are still here is because Jesus Christ came, veiled in his
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.940]   glory.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.580]   He came fully as a human being.
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:47.420]   And nowhere is that revealed more clearly than in Matthew chapter 1.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.760]   Now I'm not going to go through all the genealogy with you, but there's something about his
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.540]   genealogy that, again, if you've been in the habit of reading Matthew and just kind of
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:00.620]   skimming over the genealogy, genealogy is basically a summary of God's redemptive history.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:06.420]   So even if you skim over everything else, I strongly encourage you to study through
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.700]   the genealogy of Christ, to know who they are, know the history behind each one of these
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.700]   names.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.360]   I'm just going to highlight a few things that, again, the paradox of the son of God taking
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.380]   on human form.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.900]   First thing I want to point out here is that in his genealogy, there's mention of five
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.140]   females.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.940]   Now that may not sound like anything in our generation.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.700]   In fact, it might even sound sexist that I even said anything.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:37.140]   But at that particular time, women were not added to the genealogy at all.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.540]   They didn't have rights to purchase land.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.300]   They couldn't vote.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:48.540]   And so again, the fact that five women are mentioned in this genealogy, in and of itself,
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.520]   a modern-day Jew or even a Gentile would look at this genealogy and say, "Something is wrong.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.500]   Why would he mention these women?"
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:01.540]   Not only does he mention five separate women, of the five, three of them are Gentiles.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:07.700]   Again, to a Gentile reading this, it may not mean anything, but to a Jew, not only to mention
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:13.780]   five females, but that of the five, three of them in Jesus' line in which Jesus came
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.480]   were Gentiles, people that they would have considered unclean.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.820]   But what's even more amazing about that, that among these Gentiles, there's a woman named
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:31.460]   Tamar, who was a daughter-in-law of Judah, which is the line that Jesus came, the kingly
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.860]   line.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.020]   But if you know about the history of Tamar, Tamar's husband dies.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:43.120]   And again, at that particular time, the tradition was that the second brother would conceive
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:49.480]   a child with the sister-in-law in order to keep the genealogy, keep the line going.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.080]   But the brother-in-laws were wicked, and they wouldn't do that.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.420]   So Tamar decided that she's going to take it upon herself, and she tricks Judah, her
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:05.620]   father-in-law, to think that she's a prostitute, and then she ends up causing him to come into
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.340]   her, and then she ends up having a child.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:16.100]   That's one of his lines, that Jesus, the Son of God, the holy, holy, holy God, in his genealogy,
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   there is incest.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:25.420]   Rahab, a Gentile prostitute, is in his genealogy.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:31.280]   Ruth, a Moabite, if you again study through the Old Testament, the Moabites were a constant
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.600]   thorn on the side of the nation of Israel.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.320]   They were the enemies of the Israelites.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.560]   And yet we have Ruth, one of the great, great, great, great, great grandmothers of Jesus,
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.080]   was a Moabite, a Gentile, a prostitute.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:52.520]   And incest in this line, you would think that this King of kings and Lord of lords, the
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.640]   holy, holy, holy God, that God created the universe, that his line would be different
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:02.860]   than this, but it's filled with sin.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:09.240]   Not only that, Ahaz and Manasseh, the two kings of Israel, that again, in the line of
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:15.160]   Jesus, they are both two of the most wicked men of Israel.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:21.000]   They actually even sacrificed their own children.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.880]   And then clearly everybody knows King David.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.000]   King David is the king.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.600]   He's the golden child of the nation of Israel.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.580]   But you know what's interesting?
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.720]   When they mention Jesus and David from that line, look what he says.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.320]   He says, "David, the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife."
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.280]   If you don't know the history behind that, it may not sound like much.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.080]   He could have easily just said, "Solomon, the son of Bathsheba," and then just moved
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.520]   on.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.160]   But Matthew doesn't do that.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.520]   He highlights the sin of David, this golden child.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:08.840]   See, Uriah was the husband of Bathsheba.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.120]   And so again, some of you guys may know that David commits adultery because he sees her
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.400]   taking a bath, and then he's aroused, and he's the king of Israel.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.160]   He can do whatever he wants, and he goes after her and then commits adultery.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:27.320]   And as a result of that, trying to hide that, he ends up killing her husband, Uriah.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.640]   See, the genealogy of Jesus doesn't hide any of that.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.680]   It exposes all of that.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.720]   He could have easily just bypassed it and said, "Well, these are all these good people
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.640]   in the line of Jesus' genealogy."
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.240]   And it wasn't simply because Matthew was being thorough.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.080]   He just happened to be a tax collector, and he's good at keeping records, and he wanted
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.760]   to make sure that everything was put in line.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.120]   That's not what happens, because there are plenty of people that are left out in this
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.400]   genealogy.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.920]   So every single person that is mentioned in Matthew's genealogy, chapter 1, is purposeful.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:09.080]   So the fact that he places Tamar and the line in which Jesus came, the Moabite, the prostitute,
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:15.880]   the idol worshippers, the sinners, and then even David, the golden child, and highlighting
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.760]   his sin in the line of Jesus' coming.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.400]   Why does Matthew do that?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.400]   Why does God allow that to happen?
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:36.040]   See, the paradox of what Jesus is doing is that this holy, holy, holy God, he walked
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.720]   among us, and in every way, he experienced our weakness.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.920]   The nature in which he comes is directly related to why he came.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.920]   Let me say that again.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.000]   The nature in which he comes is directly related to why he came.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.680]   The scripture says that he came to be the perfect mediator between man and God.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:09.000]   So the perfect mediator would be a man who fully understands the plight of mankind.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.680]   The sin, not only in man, but that is passed down from generation to generation to generation.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   The scripture says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:27.480]   And as a result of that, death and punishment reigns upon mankind.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.360]   That no matter how much we strive, no matter how much we try to better ourselves, it is
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.040]   within the umbrella of the judgment of God because of a rebellion against God.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:42.280]   So when Christ came on, took on human form, he came right into that human drama.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:48.400]   Even in his genealogy, even Jesus' perfect genealogy was not exempt from that.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:55.520]   Every human sin, every human drama that you could possibly think of, Jesus in his genealogy
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.880]   was exposed.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:05.280]   He came to sin for man because his ultimate reason why he came was to bring us to God.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.900]   So Jesus serves as the perfect mediator between us and God.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:17.280]   This holy, holy, holy God that we could not even look upon his face while he walked upon
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:23.040]   earth, little children had complete access to him.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.520]   Remember, when the children would come to Jesus, the disciples would say, "How dare
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.520]   these little children?
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.040]   They have no idea who he is.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.760]   He is the Messiah."
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.920]   They didn't fully understand who he was.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.640]   If they knew who he really was at that time, there's no way that they would have given
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.440]   access to children to God.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.280]   But even as the Messiah said, "How dare your little children come to him?"
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.720]   And Jesus stops them.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.560]   Not only does he not stop them from coming, he says to his disciples, "If your faith
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:59.000]   does not reflect that these little children, even you cannot enter."
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.600]   Tax collectors, that was shunned by the Jewish community.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.800]   They couldn't possibly think of coming into the temple.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.500]   Even if they wanted to come and worship God, the priests and the Pharisees would block
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.040]   the door miles before they would ever come.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.520]   The tax collectors were the worst of sinners in Israel.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.360]   They were traitors to the nation.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:25.760]   And yet tax collectors would invite Jesus to his house.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:34.360]   The prostitutes, they ran to Jesus for protection when they wanted to stone her.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.440]   She didn't run out of town.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:47.640]   She somehow knew that this holy man, the holiest of Israel, was where she ran for protection.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:54.520]   A hemorrhaging woman, a leper, by Jewish law, if you were a hemorrhaging woman, just the
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.760]   fact that you were in the presence of the crowd, you would have tainted every single
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.320]   person in that place.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:05.760]   And if anybody knew the problem that she had, they would have stoned her right there.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:11.640]   A leper, he had to stay a certain distance and had to warn people constantly.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.280]   "Unclean, unclean!"
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.640]   He was forced to yell even before he came into any human contact.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.880]   "Unclean, unclean!"
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.320]   So that give enough opportunity for people to get out of his way.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.720]   Or to stone him, to chase him out of town.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.480]   Because his very presence would make anybody else that he comes into contact with unclean.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:39.720]   And yet, the hemorrhaging woman and the lepers ran to Jesus, had full access to him.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:46.760]   Sinners who could not even lift their heads in prayer to God, came to Jesus, kissed his
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.960]   feet, embraced him in adoration.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:58.560]   The poor, the blind, the lame, they all sought him to seek refuge.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.800]   See, Christmas is about the Son of God.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.360]   In every way, he represented the glory of God.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   Everything was made by him and for him, took on human form, and literally became nothing.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:25.280]   Not simply to show us how humble he is, but to draw sinners like you and me to himself.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   To give us access to this God.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:36.240]   See, for Jesus, to exalt himself is a second nature.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.120]   It's not hard for him.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:43.520]   Matthew chapter 9, there's a story of this lame man that wanted to be healed and they
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:49.400]   break into Peter's house, they lower him down, hoping that Jesus would lay hands on him and
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.320]   then raise him so that he can walk.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.600]   And instead of doing that, Jesus says, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.680]   And then the Jews became irate and angry.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.880]   How dare you say that?
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.320]   Only God can do that.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.440]   And they were absolutely right.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.680]   Jesus responded to them in saying, "Which is harder to do?
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.760]   To say your sins are forgiven or to get up and walk?"
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:18.200]   To you and I, I can say your sins are forgiven.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   I can just say it.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.440]   That was easy.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   I just said it.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.960]   But I have no power to do anything.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.040]   I could just say it, but it has no real power.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:33.280]   So humanly speaking, I may superficially say this, but I've never raised anybody from the
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   dead.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.040]   I've never had anybody who was lame and then get back up.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.840]   So when he asked them, "What is harder to do?"
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.760]   I mean, it's a rhetorical question.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.280]   On the surface, it may seem like the hard thing to do is to raise him.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:51.360]   See, but for Jesus, raising him to walk is nothing.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.760]   He created the universe.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.680]   What would it take for him to just snap his finger and straighten up his leg to get up
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.680]   and walk?
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.680]   He raised people from the dead.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.860]   He walks on water.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.720]   He feeds 5,000 with a few loaves and a few fish.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.200]   He can calm the storm.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   He runs out of money.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:14.060]   He opens up the mouth of the fish and coins drop out of his mouth.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:21.520]   For Jesus to say, "Get up and walk," to exalt himself is nothing.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.820]   But in order to say, "Your sins are forgiven," the Son of God had to empty himself and took
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:33.080]   on human form and walk on earth in humiliation.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:39.020]   And even the very people that he came to be crucified and die spat on him because they
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.260]   did not understand who he was.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:49.300]   All of that is explained to us in 2 Corinthians 5, 18-21.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:55.020]   All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.840]   reconciliation.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:02.380]   That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.500]   against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.580]   Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.000]   God making his appeal through us.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.260]   We implore you on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to God.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:21.220]   For our sake, he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.060]   righteousness of God.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:32.100]   As we celebrate Christmas, we don't forget what this day really is.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.460]   This was not an average birth.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.620]   This was not just some great man who decided to take on human form.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:44.740]   This is the God of the universe who emptied himself of all glory.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:49.220]   Not only did he take on human form, he humbled himself to the point of crucifixion on the
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:56.180]   cross, all for the purpose of calling sinners to himself, that he may bring us to God.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:03.300]   And so Christmas is a day that we celebrate the Son of God beckoning to the sinful world,
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.040]   "Come!
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.940]   Come to me!
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:16.060]   The prostitutes, tax collectors, the lame, the poor, the broken, the sinners, the disenfranchised,
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:23.100]   the lonely, the dejected, come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, for he will
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.380]   give you rest."
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:31.700]   Jesus is the perfect mediator.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.260]   In Hebrews chapter 4, 15-16, it says, "For we do not have a high priest who is unable
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:41.720]   to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.340]   are, yet without sin.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:50.780]   Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.020]   and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:00.680]   Again, I know there's a lot of stuff probably, you know, most of you guys have planned today
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.540]   and tomorrow, you know, the family's going to get together and share gifts and all these
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:11.420]   things and again, I hope that God would bless your families and bless your homes richly,
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:17.800]   but in the midst of all of this, let's not forget what we are celebrating.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:25.300]   Let's not stop with Christmas just giving gifts to people that we love.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:31.060]   That Christmas is ultimately Christ saw the sins of the world and instead of running the
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:35.340]   other direction, he came toward us.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:42.020]   So I pray that our application would be that when we see sin in others, that we would bring
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.700]   the grace of God to them as well.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:51.860]   As we again ask our praise team to come back up, let's take some time to really reflect
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:39:00.380]   and pray that again, in every sermon that we give, that there would be an application.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.160]   How do we celebrate the coming of the Son of God in a way that honors him?
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:10.860]   How do we join him in seeking the lost?
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:19.420]   So today, as all over the world and all over the world, the churches are being filled,
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.900]   Christians and non-Christians to understand what this meaning is and I pray with all my
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:30.780]   heart that those of you who understand what this really means, that you would not celebrate
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.140]   like the world, that we would celebrate in a way that honors and properly reflects who
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:40.740]   he is. So let's take some time to pray as we invite our worship team to come up.
