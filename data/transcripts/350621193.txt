[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   And so what happens is that the many examples that Israel, we could have chosen,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   or God could have chosen as an example of their apostasy, of their idolatry,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.500]   about defilement of the temple, all of these things that he could have chosen,
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.000]   he goes to the Genesis, the beginning of this apostasy, was their constant grumbling,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   discontent with God. And he says to let us fear. Let us fear whatever these things that are
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   the beginning processes of drifting away from God to take this seriously.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Well, today, last week it was about the attitude. Today it was about action.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   If we are fearing, if we begin to notice these symptoms, he says in verse 11,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   "Let us be diligent to enter the rest, so that no one will fall through the following
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   the same example of disobedience." So, just as a quick review, last week we talked about
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   the rest that he is referring to is just another word for salvation.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The rest that he's referring to is an invitation to re-enter the Sabbath
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   that our Heavenly Father entered into on the seventh day.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   To find that rest that was broken because of our sins, because we couldn't be in the presence of God.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   So, Sabbath is an invitation back into restoration with the God of this rest.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I think the best way for us to understand this rest is the difference between a house and a home.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   If you've ever traveled for a long period of time, a week, maybe a month,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   you may have gotten a very nice hotel or you got an Airbnb, maybe even better than your own house.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And so when you first enter into it, it has better amenities, it has a better stove,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   it's a better location. And you say, "Wow, this is great, we're going to enjoy it."
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   But after about two, three weeks, it gets tiresome because it's not your home,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   it's not your bed, it's not your refrigerator. And so, you know when you come back home
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and you open the door, and it may not be in the best place, it may be a one-bedroom apartment,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   but you sit down, unpack your stuff, get into your comfortable clothes,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and you sit on your couch, and then you feel at rest.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And it's not because it's better facilities, it's not because it's a better house,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   it's just your home. That's the difference between having all the peace
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   that the world can give you externally, but not being at home.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And that's the struggle for a Christian. That when we are constantly living
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   to make this place our home, we are going the opposite direction of where God is taking us.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   He's actually pulling us away from these distractions to make sure
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   that our rest is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   So when he says, "Let us be diligent to enter that rest,"
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   he's not simply talking about taking away all the things that causes turmoil in our life,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   but it's an invitation to come to himself.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   "Let us be active in our faith," to remind us again that we are aliens and strangers in this world.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   It doesn't matter if you have a large house, it doesn't matter whether your bills are paid,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   or what kind of position that you have at work, and you can have all the best friends
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and all the peace that the world can offer, we will still be aliens and strangers in this world.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And the minute that we forget that, the minute that we are striving to make this place our rest,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   that's where the turmoil increases for a Christian.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   He says, "We must be diligent. We must labor to rest,"
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   which on the surface sounds like a contradiction.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It sounds like one cannot do the other. I mean, if you are working, you are not resting,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   because typically when we say, "Hey, relax," it means drop whatever you're doing and just sit.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Just relax. I'm going to go home and relax.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You're going to go turn on the TV, watch Netflix, and you're just going to do nothing.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   That's what we typically mean by rest.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   But here he says, "To work. Let us work. Be diligent to enter the rest so that we would not fall."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Well, that language is not unique to Hebrews.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   All throughout Scripture, we are challenged to labor, to work, for whatever the reason—
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   there it goes—for whatever the reason, we have misapplied or misunderstood the grace of God
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   to mean that therefore we don't need to worry about anything, because the grace of God covers all of it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   We just relax.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And yet, all throughout the Scripture, we are called to labor because of this grace.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Ephesians 4, verse 1.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   After three chapters of Paul expositing and encouraging about election, about adoption, about predestination,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   about how God stepped off of his throne and pursued us completely sovereignly, unilaterally, he loved us.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   At the conclusion of explaining this, he said, "The application of this grace in chapter 4, verse 1,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called."
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   He doesn't say, "You know what? Since God elected you, since you've been adopted, since God predestined you,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   just relax and coast along."
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   That's not how he applies that.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   The application of the grace of God and sovereignty of God and predestination is,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   "Therefore, since God has given you what you didn't deserve, let us live up to the calling.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Let us live worthy of the gospel."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   In other words, be diligent.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Be diligent to apply.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   In fact, again, in Philippians chapter 127, "Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ."
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Isn't the root message of the gospel that God did what you could not do?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So how can he tell us to live worthy of the gospel?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Because the whole purpose of the gospel is to teach us that we're not worthy of the gospel.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   How can any one of us be worthy of the blood of the son of Jesus Christ?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   None of us are worthy.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   That's the fundamental, foundational message of the gospel.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You are not worthy.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And yet Paul says, "Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ."
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Because of this paradox, a seeming contradiction, people have chosen either one or the other.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Some people have taken the grace of God and said, "Well, because it is by grace, we don't really have to worry about this other part."
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And anybody who challenges us...
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Sorry, this isn't working today.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Alright.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And anybody who begins to challenge us to labor and say, "Well, that's legalistic."
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Anybody who focuses on, "We need to do the work of God."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They say, "That's legalistic. It's by the grace of God."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And they've chosen to come to this side to the extent that we begin to ignore passages like chapter 4, verse 11.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And then you have the people who are on the other side that we need to work so hard.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And we forget about the grace of God and we begin to squeeze the life out of every individual.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Well, the language in the Bible never excludes either.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It is the grace that fuels us to work.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It is the grace of God that is the foundation in which we build our diligent work.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It is never one or the other.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   It is not the grace that causes us not to do anything.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And it is not the hard work that says, "Well, we need to earn ourselves into the kingdom."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It is because we have been given what you and I don't deserve, it gives us the fuel to labor.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I think the perfect illustration for me is...
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Once a soldier is enlisted into the army, whether he is a seasoned veteran who's been to multiple combats,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   or he just got recruited and it's his first day in basic training.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Once a soldier is recruited, he's a soldier.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Whether you are a general or whether you are a foot soldier private, you are a soldier.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But a soldier who just enlisted is beginning to learn and get basic training to act like a soldier.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And so when he gets enlisted, they will begin to train him and say,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   "Now that you are the soldier of the United States, now begin to act like it."
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And so that's what basic training is.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Basic training is to teach a soldier who is already a soldier how to act.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   But he's already become a soldier.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And that's the calling of every Christian.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We have been given something that you and I could not possibly earn.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And so you have become a child of God.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You have become an adopted child that God loves.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And as a result of that, because you have been given something that you cannot possibly earn,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   now begin to act like it.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Act like a soldier now that you've put on the robe of Christ on you.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And that's the language we see all throughout Scripture.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   2 Timothy 2.10
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   "For this reason, endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with it eternal glory."
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   He says he understands that God has already chosen them.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   But for their sake, he says, "I'm going to labor hard."
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So God's election never negated Paul's hard work.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Philippians 2.12
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   If the salvation was by grace, why do we need to work it out?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   See, salvation by election never negated Paul's hard work.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Again, in Colossians 1.28-29
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   "We proclaim him admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   so that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   For this purpose I labor, striving according to his power which mightily works within me."
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Apostle Paul doesn't say, "I'm going to work so hard."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   No, in my labor, I recognize the only reason why I'm able to labor
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   is because of his work that is already working inside of me.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   It was never one or the other.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It was always both.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It wasn't like, "I'm saved by grace, so it doesn't matter.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I'm going to work hard so that I can deserve this grace."
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   It was always both.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Now, why is this so important?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Because laboring and striving is a part of Christian life.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   When we begin to drift, you don't need to do anything to drift.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Drifting happens by somebody who just sits there and does nothing.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   He's not rowing. He's not headed anywhere in particular.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   He's not concerned about where he's going to end up. It doesn't matter.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Drifting happens when you're just not anchored.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And so when there isn't a current, when a storm is not there,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   you may not drift far because there's nothing happening,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   but as soon as the water begins to move up and down,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   all you have to do is to do nothing.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Do what you've been doing all along,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   and next thing you know is you are miles and miles away from shore.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And if you do that for a year and multiple years,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   one day you wake up and you realize you don't even recognize where you were.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   That's how far you drift.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And so the warning of let us fear.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Take this seriously.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   If the gospel that you heard means anything to you,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   if you have even a little bit of faith,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and this is serious and it is real,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and if you see yourself drift, if you've seen yourself drift,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   your heart has become hardened toward God,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   let us fear.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And then second, be diligent.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   What must happen? What needs to be done?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   What is it that's causing me to drift?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   How do I anchor myself in Christ?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Well, that's where we get verse 12.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Verse 12 is a passage that probably many of you have already memorized.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   For the word of God is living and active sharper than any double-edged sword.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It is able to divide between joint and marrow, spirit and soul.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   It is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   But we need to recognize this first in the context of which it is being said.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   In and of itself, right, you've probably heard many, many sermons on this text itself.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   So it stands on its own.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   But if you want to understand the full context of this first,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   you have to understand why this is written in this verse, in this context.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He begins by saying for the word of God is living and active.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   For.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The word for connects us to the idea that he was saying in verse 11.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Right?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   The warning against drifting.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And a challenge to be diligent so that we do not drift.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And so the verse 12 is written as the motivation of why we should not drift.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And what's going to happen if we do drift.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So how is this connected?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   How is verse 11 connected to verse 12 and 13?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   For the word of God is living and active sharper than any two-edged sword.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I think the best way for us to understand that is go back to the book of Amos
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and see what he means.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And I think that application will make more sense.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Before I read the passage in the book of Amos,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   the history behind Israel during the period that Amos is prophesying,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   they were living in peace.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   All their enemies were conquered.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   The temple worship was in full swing.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   They had probably more wealth than they've ever known, at least in their history.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   So there was a lot of religious activity that was going on at the temple.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Many, many sacrifices.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Many Sabbaths being observed.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And yet Amos is sent to the nation of Israel because everything was done externally.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And God repeatedly says to them that all of your many sacrifices,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   they are meaningless.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And even their singing.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Even their gathering.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   He says they are evil assemblies.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And in the end he says,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   "I didn't ask you to make many sacrifices because he loved the smell of burnt animals."
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   "He just happens to like to see blood flow on tables."
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And so he says, "All of these things that you're doing, they are meaningless to me."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   "Because you have drifted."
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   "Externally you are doing everything religious, but internally there is no true worship going on."
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   The reason why he commanded them to make these sacrifices
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   was that through the sacrifice to humble themselves before a holy God
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   and acknowledge that they are in need of forgiveness.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   To come and genuinely in their repentance find forgiveness by the blood of these animals.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Which ultimately was pointing to Christ.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   But to them it became a source of righteousness.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   That I did this and I did that.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   And it is to these people that he sends the prophet Amos, chapter 7, verse 7 and 8.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   "Thus he showed me and behold the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plum line in his hand."
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   "The Lord said to me, 'What do you see Amos?' and I said, 'A plum line.'
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   "Then the Lord said, 'Behold I am about to put a plum line in the midst of my people Israel and I will spare them no longer.'"
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   What does he mean by the plum line?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Plum line is a modern day, equivalent to a modern day leveler.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   A leveler, if you ever use that, no you put it against anything that you build
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   that you want to be vertical level. It has to be perfect.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Because if it's even a little bit crooked and you put any kind of weight on it, it's going to collapse.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And so a plum line is basically a leveler that even though by their naked eye it looks straight
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   you put a plum line next to it with a weight on the bottom with a string
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and they can see if it is actually plum.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   That's what a plum line is.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   So the plum line that God is referring to is showing Amos is the Word of God.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   That everything on the surface looks religious.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Many sacrifices are being made.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   They're checking off all the right boxes.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   But when the Word of God is open to them, they have drifted so far away from God
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   it has nothing to do with Him.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   And therefore he says that judgment is coming upon Israel
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   because everything that they were doing was superficial, was external.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   That's what he means in verse 12.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   He said the reason the warning is given, why we need to be diligent
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   because oftentimes we can fool ourselves.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   And it is easy to fool ourselves when we are active in the church.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It is easy to fool ourselves when we are doing our duties.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   But we know deep in our hearts that we've drifted.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   We know deep in our hearts that everything has become a burden.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   And it's been a long time that you've actually worshipped God.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It's been a long time since you've run to God for refuge because you needed Him.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   You did it out of obligation. You did it out of duty.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   You did it because other people are watching.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   You did it because you have a title.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   But your heart has drifted far from God.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And that's why he says for the Word of God is living and active.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   You can fool your wife. You can fool your children.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   You can fool your church and your leaders.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You can fool your friends, your family.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   But you cannot fool the Word of God.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   That's what he means. For the Word of God is living and active.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Sharper than any double-edged sword.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   It is living. It is active.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   You know what's interesting is in the Greek construction of this verse,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   for the purpose of emphasis, when an idea should really pop out,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   one of the things that they did was they would do it in repetition.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   They would say Peter, Peter or Holy, Holy, Holy.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And you know that that's important.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Another tool that they used is they would use whatever was to be emphasized
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   to put it at the beginning of the sentence.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And so in the Greek, the word for living is in the front.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   So if we were to translate it exactly the way that is written in the Greek,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   it would say living is the word. Living is the word.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   So the emphasis is that the Word of God is not just an ancient document,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   even though it's written in three different languages,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Aramaic, in ancient Hebrew and Koine Greek.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   And all three languages are dead languages.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   It's no longer used today.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   In fact, ancient Hebrew was already pretty much dead by the time of Christ.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   So only scholars and scribes used ancient Hebrew at that time.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   That's why when we study the Old Testament, usually we go to the Septuagint,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   the Greek translation of the Hebrew.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   So all three languages, Aramaic and even the Greek, it's Koine Greek.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   It's not the modern day Greek that is being used today.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   So all three languages are not languages that are being used today.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   So even though the Bible is written in dead languages,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   it was written 2,000, 3,000 years ago, respectively,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   he says it is still living.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   It is still active.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   2 Timothy 3, 16, all Scripture is inspired by God.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   The word inspired literally means God breathed.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And the reason why the Word of God is active and it is living,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   it is because his very breath has been placed in this word.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   His very breath has been put into this word.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   So we're not just reading an ancient document.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   If the Bible is just literature,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   and many people have a difficult time reading the Bible because it's just literature to them.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   But anybody, even if you are illiterate, if you receive a love letter,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   you will learn how to read.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   They said that 95% of the people who finish school,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   and they're not attending school,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   95% of all Americans never read a book after they graduate.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   95%.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So if you've ever read a book after you graduated, you're 5%.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Part of the reason why so few people know what the Word of God is,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   is because they just don't like to read.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   It's a burden to study.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   But here's what's different.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   If all you see the Bible as is just literature,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   then we're all out of luck.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   95% of the world, we're not going to be able to reach with the Word of God.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   But the Word of God is not just literature.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   If all you see is a book, then yeah, we're basically screwed.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   But the Word of God is living and active.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   The very breath of God has been invested in here.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   So if you want to connect with God,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   the Bible is the primary way that we hear His voice.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   It is living and active.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   We're studying the book of Philippians.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Those of you who've been with us for more than 10 years,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   you know that at some point in our church,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   we've actually studied the book of Philippians.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   So this is not the first time.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I preach through Philippians.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So this is actually the third time that we're studying.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   In fact, the first time we did it,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   we actually, the whole church memorized the book of Philippians.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   So every once in a while, you'll see some of us Pharisees
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   with green T-shirts with the book of Philippians on our chest.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   So Tanya actually designed it, and it says, I think it says "Rejoice" on it.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   It says "Rejoice" or something.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It has a theme of Philippians, and then the whole book of Philippians.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Or it says "Joy." I forgot what it was.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   But we have those T-shirts, if we still have it, right?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   When you look at that, you say, well, we've studied through that already.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   We've already memorized that.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   You've already preached through it.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Like, why are we doing it again?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   I guarantee you, you can study it for the next 40 years.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   How you read Philippians will be very different
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   as a 10-year-old, 20-year-old, 30-year-old, 40-year-old, 50-year-old.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   As a rich person or a poor person.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   It will sound very different when you're married and when you're single.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   When you have children or multiple children and don't have children.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   When you're in time of despair and when you're in time of rejoicing.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   When you're hurting and when you're happy.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   When your life is filled with friends or when you feel lonely.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   The Word of God will seem very different because you change.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Time changes.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Because it is not stagnant.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   It is living and it is active.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   If it is just literature, once is enough.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Once you've memorized it, you can move on.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   But because it's living and active, it is constantly changing.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Not because God is changing,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   but because it is constantly speaking to every part of our lives in different parts.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   I don't know how many times I would sit and do quiet time over the same passage.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I mean, I've preached through pretty much the whole Bible.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   So I've read multiple commentaries on every single text,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   even though I don't remember most of this stuff.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   I've gone through it enough where I'm familiar with superficial stuff about the Bible.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   About the general knowledge of what the Word of God says.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   But I don't know how often I sit in front of it and I am just amazed.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Again, I can't believe I missed that.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   I can't believe that that's connected.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   You know, during summer retreat, one of our workshops is inerrancy.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   And so a lot of people have already signed up for that.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   It's about basically how do we get the Bible, why is it reliable, why is it authoritative.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And so our Elder James is going to be teaching that.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I think it's going to be a very useful seminar to be in.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   But the ultimate test of the Word of God is in the Bible itself.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   It's in the Bible itself.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   You've already heard, the real author of the Bible is the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   It's God himself.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   And so on the surface, when you study it like literature, you can see Paul's personality, Peter's personality.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   You can kind of debate over who wrote the book of Hebrews.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   And like, who's Moses, what is his personality like.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And superficially you can get all of that.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   But when you really begin to dig through the Word of God, it is so crystal clear that there is one author.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   The roots are so deep and so interconnected.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   There is no way a human being or many human beings, no matter how many lives that they lived, could have put this together.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   It may seem like circular reasoning to you.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And it's not something that I'm going to be able to convince with my words until you get into it yourself.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   You know how often I sit in the middle of quiet time, I feel like I see him.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   This is not written by man.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Nobody is this clever.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Nobody is this smart.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Nobody is this profound.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Over and over, year after year, decade after decade, generation after generation, it is living and it is active.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   In Psalm, chapter 1 to 1 to 3, the word active is energes, where we get the word energy.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   But if you look at Psalm, blessed is the man.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   The whole book of Psalms, it starts with Psalm, chapter 1, and it kind of prepares the reader for what's coming.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   But he begins, happy, blessed.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   You know, happy, blessed, these are all just different words for somebody who is in the Sabbath.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Somebody who is at rest. He is no longer in turmoil.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   But happy is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law he meditates day and night.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   If you read that and you don't like reading, you're in trouble.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Because he said, happy is the man who delights in the law of the Lord.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   He delights in the law of the Lord.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Oh man, every time I read the Bible, I fall asleep.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   There are some people who really delight in studying, these theological nerds.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   They love to read many chapters and talk about theology.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   That's not me. I just want to be basic.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Not the new hip term basic, but just the old understanding of basic. Fundamental.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   I lost some of you.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Only Sharon knows what I'm talking about.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   When I see Psalm 1, it's a description of somebody who's in love with God.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   It's a description of somebody who delights in the law because he hears his master's voice.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And he wants to know what he has to say.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   He's not somebody who just loves law.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   He's not talking about a Pharisee who likes to dissect what does the Sabbath mean, how far can we go,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   what can we carry, what can't we carry.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   He's not describing somebody who likes to dissect what it says.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   He delights in the law of the Lord because he knows who he is.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   He sees and he's experienced the breath of God.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And he wants more. He delights in the law of the Lord.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   In his law, he meditates day and night.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And he will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   He's an individual who's drinking of this water and is being filled with life and energy
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   which yields its fruit in season and its leaf does not wither.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And in whatever he does, he's prosperous.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   He's not an individual who's just determined to do the right thing.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   He's an individual who has tasted the goodness of God and wants more.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   He delights in the law of the Lord.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And he begins to bear fruit as a result of this delighting.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Isn't that exactly what Jesus said?
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   If you want to bear fruit, abide in me.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Stay close to me.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Abide in me.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Be near me. Do not drift from me.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   The whole book of Hebrews, our retreat theme is about anchoring in Christ.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Because until we are anchored in Christ, this will be a burden to you.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Does it not?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   If you don't have any affection for God, studying the word of God is an obligation.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Especially if you don't like reading.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Some of you guys just like reading for no reason.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Maybe a few of you just want to know more theology.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   You want to be able to debate and put the people in their place.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Maybe that's what it is.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   But if all it is, if studying the Bible, all it is, is just to gain more knowledge, this is a burden.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   But this is not a description of just doing the right thing.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   This is somebody who is in love with Christ.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   That's why Jesus says, "My sheep, they hear my voice and they follow."
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   When they hear my voice, it perks up because it's not simply like, "Oh, there's his voice and I better do this."
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   It's because they want to be there because that's where food is.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   That's where safety is. That's where they feel protected.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   That's where when the wolves come, that their shepherd is going to protect them.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   So when they hear the Master's voice, they automatically perk up and go.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   "My sheep, they hear my voice," and his voice has been put into his word.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   It's his very breath. It's living and active.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   That's why Paul says, "Preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Because fruit comes from hearing his voice being near him.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Fruitfulness does not come because of technique.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   I hear so many people who say, "You know what? We've tried this and people don't want it."
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   "They're not going to come if we do it this way."
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   So they begin to look for techniques and they begin to change things here and there.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And so there's nothing evil about any of that.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   It's neither here nor there.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   But fruit does not come because of technique.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Fruit comes because his word is preached and his sheep hear his voice and they want more.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   That's why he says, "Preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Whether they listen or don't listen, whether people gather or don't gather,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   whether people feel loved or don't feel loved, whether they're encouraged or not encouraged.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   He said, "Preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Because there are some times it's going to come a period of time
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   when people are going to be sick and tired of listening to words that are discouraging, convicting.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He said, "They're not going to want that."
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   When that happens, when that period comes, you stick with it.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Preach the word in season and out of season.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Because the very breath that he has placed to convict us, to motivate us, to challenge us,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   to not drift has been put into his word.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Do not drift.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   He said, "The word of God goes forth and it will not return until it has accomplished its purpose."
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Sometimes the purpose of God's word is to divide.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   It's to divide between bone and marrow, between spirit and soul.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   It's to divide between those who believe and those who don't believe.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   And so when the word is preached and unbelieving hears it, he is irritated.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   He is out of place.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   If you're a child of the darkness, the word of God is the light being turned on.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And God's presence, his holy presence comes into our life
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and the reaction of a creature who belongs in the dark
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   is trying to find a hole where he feels comfortable.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And the word of God is preached.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   But if you're a child of the light and you have been in the darkness,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   you're going to thank God that the light is turned on.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Because now you can see where your master is and you can go.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   And that's why he says, "Preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Whether people come or don't come.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Because that's where, it's the word of God that's living and active.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Not the technique, not the organization, not some new discipleship program,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   not the friends around you, not a single pastor, not a group of leaders,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   not a particular generation, not a particular book of opinions,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   not experiences, not money.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   That's not where fruit is.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   True fruit is when we truly abide in Christ.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Truly abide in Christ.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   It is sharper than any two-edged sword.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   The two-edged sword that he's referring to is a combat sword.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   He's referring to the battle.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And he said every single one of us is engaged in the spiritual battle.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And the word of God is the primary tool that he's given us.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It is sharper than that.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   I don't want to sidetrack about, is there spirit and soul?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Are they separate?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Are we two? Are we three?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I don't want to get into any of that.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Dichotomous or trichotomous.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Because I think in the end we missed the point
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   because it's just a hyperbole to say how sharp and effective the word of God is.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   That's exactly how the word of God was preached in the early church
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   when Apostle Paul, without hesitation, in boldness,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   he begins to preach the same gospel that Jesus preached,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   and he begins to indict them that the author of life that you proclaim to worship,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   you killed him.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And he says this to the same people who crucified Christ,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   probably expecting that he's going to be crucified as well.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   I'm not going to fail my master twice.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   After he preaches, Acts 2.37-38,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   "Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart."
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   They were cut to the heart.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   "Their thoughts and intention was judged and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   'Brethren, what shall we do?'
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Peter said to them, 'Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'"
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   The word for cut here in Hebrews 4.12 is to cut or agitate violently.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Violent agitation cutting.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It's a word that is used in battle.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   When you're in hand-to-hand combat, you don't want a dull sword.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   You don't want a sword that is inappropriate.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   It's sharper than that.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   In Amos 8.11-12, it basically says in the end,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   after he has spread the word, he said when the famine comes,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   it's going to be famine of the word.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   People are going to be staggering from place to place, wanting to hear from God,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   connect with God, but God's final judgment is the word will not be taught.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   So when the word goes forth and it begins to cut,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   it's God's grace.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   It's God's love being patient and drawing us to him.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   2 Timothy 3.16, all scripture is inspired by God.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   God breathed, and it is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be adequately equipped
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   for every good work.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   He is equipped for every good work.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Every time something happens and it doesn't work and we're frustrated,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   we're always looking for new things.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   But he said it's the word of God that is profitable, that's useful,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   for training a man in righteousness.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   For whatever the reason, we think in order to do missions,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   we have to learn anthropology, contextualization,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   we have to be able to maybe do a little bit of marketing,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   get a business degree, and know how to manage.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He says, no, it's the word of God.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And again, there is a place for all of that stuff.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   But this is being applied by people who don't know the scripture.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   If you want to be equipped to do evangelism,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   if you want to be equipped to do evangelism,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   if you're not that familiar with the word of God,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   before you learn technique of how to answer apologetic questions,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   how to use verbal judo to take somebody who's asking these questions
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   and flip them around and attack them with the word of God,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   before you learn all these techniques,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   if you're not familiar with the book of Leviticus,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   that's where you should start.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   If you don't know what the book of Numbers is for,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   that's where you should start.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   The word of God says it's his word that is useful to rebuke, to train,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   that man of God may be thoroughly equipped,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   thoroughly equipped for every good work.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   You could have all the training in the world, all the technique,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   all the experience in the world, but the word of God is not in you.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   You cannot bear fruit.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   But you take an individual who just--
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   the word of God is just overflowing in him.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And I'm not talking about simply knowledge.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   I'm talking about his connection with the Father.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   You take an individual where the living water is just overflowing in him,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   you see what kind of evangelist he is.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   See, when the Bible calls us to evangelize,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   it doesn't say go do witnessing.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   He says be a witness, to be a witness.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   If you're not witnessing God, of course,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   the only other option is to have technique.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   But you take an individual, no matter how old, no matter how young,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   when the living water is overflowing in him,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   just sit him on a plane with somebody.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   See if he doesn't come out.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   You know, we're trying so hard to share the gospel with our children.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   When your heart is filled with the love of God,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   see if that conversation just doesn't happen.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   It overflows because that's what he loves.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   You know when somebody is like a crazy Lakers fan, crazy Lakers fan,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   like we know, we know.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   We have somebody who loves Jeremy Lin like that at our church.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   You're laughing because you know who he is.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   He didn't have a plan.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   He didn't have a plan to let you know that that's what it was.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   He didn't have a flow chart of what he needs to do to get the word out.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   He just is a fan.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I'm a fan of Jeremy Lin, right?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   He's a little bit higher than me, right?
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   He didn't have to try.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Now, I'm just using that as an example.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   If you fall in love with Christ, you will become the best evangelist.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   You will become the best small group leader.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   You will become the best teacher.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   When the word of God is overflowing in you,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   it is not technique that causes the fruit.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   It is the living water in you.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   It is the Christ in you who will bear witness through you.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   We, our natural tendency is to give credit to creation rather than the creator.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   That is our natural tendency.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   So whenever something doesn't work, we think we need to do more.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Instead of going back to what he said,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   "Am I abiding in Christ? Have I drifted away from him?
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Am I anchored in him?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Is it because I haven't been anchored, why I sense this frustration?"
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   The word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   It's the word of God that judges the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And then in verse 13, "And there is no creature hidden from his sight,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   If you read verse 13, you may look at that,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   and either it will cause you to feel anxious and suffocate it.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   You know the word for open, "triclitzo," where we get the word "tracheotomy."
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Basically, you know the procedure when somebody can't breathe,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   and they puncture a hole, and then they make sure they breathe directly out.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   That's where the word comes from, "triclitzo."
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   It's to be open, open so that they can breathe.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And then the word for laid bare, "gymnazzo," where we get the word "gymnasium."
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   So today, when we think of gymnasium, we think of lifting weights and becoming healthy.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   But at that time, "gymnazzo" is basically where two athletes, male athletes, would come,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   and they would be completely naked.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And that's where the word "naked" comes from.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And the reason why they're naked is because it was meant to be a pure competition.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   No tools, no clothing, nothing.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   It was just flesh to flesh that they would wrestle with no encumbrance.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   And that's the word that is used here, that before God, we are all open, and we are all bare.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Now, if we don't understand that in the context of what he is saying,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   we can hear that and say, "Wow, God, we're completely naked before God.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   How suffocating."
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Let me read Psalm 139 with you, up to verse 18.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   "How you receive this may be evidence of where you are with God right now."
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Psalm 139, if you guys know, it's about David who's proclaiming that God is omnipresent, and he's omnipotent.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   In Psalm 139, verse 138, "O Lord, you have searched me and known me.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   You know when I sit down and when I rise up.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   You understand my thought from afar.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   You scrutinize my path and my lying down and are intimately acquainted with all my ways.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it all.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   You have enclosed me behind and before and laid your hand upon me."
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   If he stopped right there, he knows everything.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   You can't hide from him.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   He knows even the words before I say it.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   He knows all of that.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Who would want this?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   How suffocating.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   But that's not what David is saying.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   If you look at verse 6, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   It is too high.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   I cannot attain to it.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Where can I go from your spirit or where can I flee from your presence?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   If I ascend to heaven, you are there.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, where can I possibly run?
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   But in verse 10, "Even there your hand will lead me and your right hand will lay hold of me."
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   The point of this is like, no matter where I try to run, I can't hide from you.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   It's suffocating.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   I mean, you would think that that's what he would say, but he doesn't say that.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Everywhere I go, there he is.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Even my words, he knows me better than myself.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   But after he said that, what does he say?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   "Because of that, I know that he will lead me."
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   There is no place that I can go where God is too far to reach.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   There is no thought.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   There is nothing that I've said.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   There is nothing I have done.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   There is nothing I will do.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   There is nothing that I'm doing now where God is not present.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And so, if you are drifting and you don't care, it is very suffocating.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Because he's basically saying you can't run from God.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   The word of God will judge the thoughts and intentions of your heart.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   But if you hear his voice, no matter how far you have drifted, no matter what you have said,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   no matter what you have done, he says, "The Lord is there and he knows how to lead me."
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   That's what Paul is saying.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   The word of God is powerful enough.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   It is living and active.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   It is sharper than any double-edged sword.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   It is a source of comfort to him.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Verse 11, "If I say, 'Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, and the light around me will be night,'
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   even the darkness is not dark to you, and the night is as bright as the day.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Darkness and light are like to you, for you form my inward parts.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   You wove me in my mother's womb."
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   And his response, he breaks out in praise.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   "I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Wonderful are your works, and my soul knows it very well."
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   He doesn't say, "Oh, I'm suffocating."
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   See, when he was hiding his sin, and he was running from God, he felt this weight of his sin.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   But as soon as he acknowledged it, and he came before God, and he repented,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   he said, "Where can I go?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I try to hide, I try to run, but I realize that I can't run from you."
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   And that's what brought him to repentance, and because of this repentance, he said,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   "Thank God you know how to lead me, even in my own deception.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Even though I try to deceive the whole world, the whole kingdom, as the king."
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   And he probably even forgot himself, when the prophet was given an illustration
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   of this evil man who took advantage of his servants.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   He said, "Who did this?"
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   He deceived himself.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   And yet, when the word of God was given to him, God led him out of that.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And that's what's leading him to pray, "I will give thanks to you, Lord,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   and skillfully wrought in depths of the earth.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Your eyes have seen my uninformed substance, and in your book were all written
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there was not one of them.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   How precious also are your thoughts to me."
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   What are his thoughts?
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   His word.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   His word.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   He's Psalm chapter 1.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   He's a man who delights in the law of the Lord because he found rest in Christ.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   That no matter how far he tried to run from God, there he was.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   No matter how far he tried to run, no matter what hole he crept into, there he was.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   And God delivered him from his sins.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   He delivered him from his own deception.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Praise God.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   The rest that we have that God offers can only be found when we are near Christ.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   You know, when you first get married--well, I'll start with the dating.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Okay?
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   When you first date, everybody puts their best foot forward.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   If the first date you go out and the guy comes out with sweatpants, just walk out.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Because that's the best.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   That's the best.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   It's just going to go down from there.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   This guy's making no effort whatsoever.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   So if he comes out to a date, he's presenting the best that he has.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   He brushes his teeth, does his hair, puts the best suit on, whatever it is,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   that he's going to come out and he's going to present the best.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   As you get comfortable, it's going to start creeping out.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   You don't have the best hygiene, whatever it is, and your bodily fluids,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   and stuff like that comes out.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   So some of you who have been dating for a while, you've been holding it in for so long,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   but eventually it leaks out.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   You can't hide forever.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Eventually it comes out.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   So when you first get married, there's some nervousness.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Because now you can't hide.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Maybe you did a really good job.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   You held the gas in for long, but you're going to be living together.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Some of you guys just didn't care right off the bat.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   You were comfortable from the beginning.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   But if you did a good job, you went in.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   But you know that's not going to last.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   There's some nervousness.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And not only that, I'm just using that as an example.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   But in your honeymoon stage, you're trying still.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   But eventually it's going to leak out.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   All your idiosyncrasies, all your bad habits, your hygiene, all of it is going to begin to leak out.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   And there's this awkwardness of like, "Oh, my God, I didn't know that about her.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   I didn't know that about him."
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   And you go through that.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   But after you've been married for a long period of time, there is nothing hidden.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Where can I go when she's not there?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   She knows everything.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Esther knows.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Even before I open my mouth, she starts to mimic my sermon.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   She knows.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   But there's a sense of comfort and rest in that.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Because I don't need to prove myself to her.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   She doesn't need to prove herself to me.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   She knows all my weaknesses and failures.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   And I know all of hers.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   And so we feel comfortable because we don't have to pretend.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   And I feel rest.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   That's what he means in Psalms.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   No matter where I go, we're not pretending before God.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   God already knows everything.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   He's not shocked by you.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Whatever mistakes that you have made, however far you have drifted from God, past, present, or future,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   God knows all of that.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   The reason why he came to die for us is because he knows you.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   He knows you.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   He knew what you were going to do.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   He knew that none of us could have made it by our own effort.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And that's why he came to die.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   He didn't die so that we would no longer sin, even though that's what he calls us to do.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   He knew we couldn't.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   So he made us righteous.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   And then he tells us to now do your best to live up to that.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   There is freedom in Christ.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   True freedom in Christ that you will not find in any relationship, any kind of security, in any kind of job, any kind of praise.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   There's this living water that only Christ can give.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   There's a bread that only Christ can give.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   And that's what he is saying here.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   He says, "Do not drift, for the word of God is living and active.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   You cannot hide before God.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Everything is bare.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   But there is freedom in that if we receive it and come to him."
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   And so that is my prayer, and that is the exhortation of the author of the book of Hebrews.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Where are you?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Are you one of those people who are working hard saying, "You know what?
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   I need to at least be a B student.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   I need to at least be a C student before I can come to church and become a member or fellowship with these people.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Or if I can be any kind of use to God, I need to at least make myself to be a B."
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   The whole reason why God called us in the first place is because we could not.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Every single one of us is deserving of the judgment of God by our own righteousness.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   If you found yourself drifting, let me conclude with this one encouragement.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   It's probably one of the biggest epiphany that I had through the word of God.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   And for the sake of time, I'm not going to get into it.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   But the only Christian who fails is the one who quits.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Only Christian who fails is the one who quits.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Because he already won the battle for us.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.200]   Let's take some time to pray as we invite our worship team to come.
