[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:22.080]   Good morning church family, hopefully everyone had a good week in the Lord.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.760]   As always, it's a joy and a privilege for us to come together and to worship our God.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.740]   I'd like to begin by reading Psalm 28, verses 6 and 7.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.480]   Blessed be the Lord, because he has heard the voice of my supplication.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.920]   The Lord is my strength and my shield.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.280]   My heart trusts in him, and I am helped.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.640]   Therefore, my heart exults, and with my song, I shall thank him.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.160]   Amen, so and with that, let us sing, and let us give thanks to our God.

[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.680]   >> All right, good morning.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   Welcome to Brain Community Church.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.680]   Let me get to some announcements before we get started.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.680]   First of all, our Intentional Sisters Fellowship, that's starting in February.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.680]   Today is the last day to sign up, so if you're intending to sign up,
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   please sign up as soon as possible today.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.680]   Our outreach team is having a volleyball event, again, for the purpose of outreach.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.680]   If you are planning to come or bring somebody,
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.680]   today is the last day to sign up for that as well.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.680]   And then this coming Saturday, we have a men's ministry fellowship,
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.680]   where we have our pastor, Sung Kang.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   He's going to be coming and addressing the issue of men's purity.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   And so if you are a man in our church, and this is high school and above,
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   this is open to you.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   It is $10, we have light breakfast, and then lunch fellowship afterwards.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.680]   So please sign up for that, and again, this is happening this coming Saturday.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.680]   There's a bunch of other stuff going on, but one other thing.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   We are going to be offering a class on Old Testament survey.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.680]   If you haven't taken that, I highly recommend that you take this class.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   Pastor Peter Chung is going to be going over Old Testament survey for six weeks,
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   starting from March 3rd to April 14th.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   It's going to be from 2 to 3.30 in the sanctuary.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.680]   It will help you tremendously.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   If you have a very loose grasp of what's happening in the Old Testament,
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.680]   it will open up the Bible to you.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.680]   Understanding the Old Testament will help you to open up the New Testament,
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.680]   because the New Testament is an extension of what God's doing in the Old Testament.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   So if you feel like you don't have a good grasp of the Old Testament,
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.680]   the history, and how the different prophets relate to one another,
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.680]   and how it's connected to the fulfilled prophecies in the New Testament,
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.680]   this is a class that we highly, highly recommend.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.680]   So if you haven't taken it, that's going to be happening starting from March 3rd
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.680]   for six weeks at 2 to 3.30.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.680]   All the other announcements, I'm going to refer you to our website,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   and more detailed stuff you can find on there.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   Let me pray for us, and I'll give you an opportunity to give online,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   and if you have a physical offering, again, we have a box in the back.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   All right, let's pray.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.680]   Father, we thank you for your goodness.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   We thank you, Lord God, for the privilege that we have
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.680]   to be able to come and worship you as a corporate body.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.680]   Lord, help us to know the privilege that we have,
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   the access that we have to you.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   Lord, what a blessing and what a gift that it is that you have given us,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   and help us to understand that, that our worship may be given to you
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.680]   as an overflow of gratitude and thanksgiving.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.680]   We pray that even in this giving that we would give joyfully,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   knowing, Father God, that every bit of it ultimately belongs to you,
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   that we are stewards to use it for your glory.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.680]   May it be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.680]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.920]   >>If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 7,
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.560]   verse 11 through 17.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:27.800]   We're finally jumping back into the Gospel of Luke.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.340]   Most of you are aware, but our youth group and our college
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.040]   ministry is up at a retreat and they're going to be coming down
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.140]   today by 1.30 or 2 o'clock, so please continue to keep them in
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.540]   your prayers.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.240]   Luke chapter 7, verse 11 through 17.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.820]   "Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain, and his
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.280]   disciples were going along with him, accompanied by a large
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.520]   crowd.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.680]   Now as he approached the gate of the city, a dead man was being
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.280]   carried out, the only son of his mother.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.020]   And she was a widow, and a sizable crowd from the city was
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.240]   with her.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.840]   When the Lord saw her, he felt compassion for her and said to
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   her, 'Do not weep.'
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.580]   And he came up and touched a coffin, and the bearers came to
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.040]   a halt, and he said, 'Young man, I say to you, arise.'
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.940]   The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.540]   to his mother.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.440]   Fear gripped them all, and they began glorifying God, saying,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.880]   'A great prophet has arisen among us, and God has visited
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.440]   his people.'
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.880]   This report concerning him went out all over Judea, and in all
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.580]   the surrounding district."
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.580]   Let's pray.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.440]   Father, we pray for deeper understanding and insight.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.140]   We pray that through the study that you would help us not
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:46.640]   simply to understand the word, but to know your very heart.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.740]   Help us to know you, and to see that we may see a greater glimpse
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.480]   of the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.580]   Sorry, I apologize if my voice sounds twangy.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.700]   Does it sound twangy?
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.700]   It doesn't?
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.440]   Okay, it sounds twangy in my own head.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.080]   So, I haven't gotten sick like this in a long time, so I was
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:15.740]   kind of bedridden this week, and recovering from India, so I feel
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.740]   weak.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.980]   I feel good, but I feel weak, so in my head it sounds twangy.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.240]   So, you sure it doesn't sound twangy?
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.700]   So, something's wrong with my ear then.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.480]   Okay.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.800]   As you guys know, we came back from India, and our team members
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.740]   last week took turns sharing about what happened, but one of
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.540]   the things that I wanted to highlight about our trip was, as
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.640]   you guys know, we've been hearing about the persecution
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:48.000]   that's been increasing rapidly out in India, and this year,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.400]   after talking to the pastor, they said that as hard as it's
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.940]   been, they see the persecution is going to become much more
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.140]   intense in the coming year.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.640]   In fact, right before we showed up to do our medical camp, one
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.780]   of the pastors in one of the villages that we went to told me
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.440]   after the camp that right before we showed up, there was a
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.900]   national day of worship that the government, the federal
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:18.280]   government, declared that every citizen in India had to worship.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.000]   And so, it's kind of like the national day of prayer, but
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.340]   again, obviously, in our country, it's done voluntarily,
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.600]   but they basically said everybody should do this, and
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.700]   the problem is, obviously, our pastors and a lot of the
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.440]   Christians in the villages did not do that, but part of the
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.300]   worship toward this goddess, this temple that they dedicated,
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.340]   is that whoever worshiped, they had to hang something outside of
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.740]   their house to show your neighbors that you participated
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.940]   in this, and so every Christian, especially our pastors who did
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.040]   not fly this, it was pretty obvious to their neighbors that
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.900]   they weren't participating, and as a result of that, the pastor
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.340]   told me that all their neighbors got extremely angry with them,
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.040]   and they were expecting some sort of attack, but because we
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.880]   were showing up to do the medical camp, they kind of held
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.440]   off, and so they were telling us that it looks like they're
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   waiting until we're done and we're gone, that they're going
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.580]   to probably get attacked, so they're anticipating attack
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.100]   coming from their neighbors, but at the end of the camp, they said
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.380]   in a positive note that a lot of their neighbors who were angry
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.880]   showed up to the medical camp, and so they were treated, and
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.300]   they had glasses, and so some of their children participated in
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.040]   the VBS, and as a result of that, they were hoping and
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:38.340]   praying that it diffused some of their anger, and so I haven't
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.940]   heard anything, so hopefully that's exactly what did happen,
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.340]   and so again, the fact that we were able to do that for them,
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.140]   and hopefully that diffusion is not just temporary, but that
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.340]   their heart, the thankfulness that they have will kind of
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.180]   protect them, at least in the villages that we've been to, but
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.640]   along with that, they said that one of the things that they
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.040]   expect to happen is that when we, when I started going into
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.840]   India 13 years ago, we got a notification from the government
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.680]   for all the foreigners not to come out of our apartments
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.780]   because there was an election that was taking place, and the
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:22.880]   election was between the moderate conservatives with the
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   radical Hindus, which is BJB, which is where the Prime
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.520]   Minister Modi came from, some of you guys who may know the
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.120]   politics in India, and at that time, they were afraid that if
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.280]   the BJB party loses, that they're going to get angry, and
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.280]   then they're going to focus their anger toward the
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.280]   foreigners, so they told us that if they see foreigners out on
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.180]   the street, and if they lose, you may get targeted, so they
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:51.180]   asked to stay home, and so after that happened, they ended up,
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.680]   actually, BJB party ended up winning by a very narrow margin.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.580]   In fact, many people were surprised that such a radical
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.780]   group, and this is a group that wants to outlaw meat, like
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.780]   they're not, to make it illegal to have meat in the country.
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.380]   That's how radical they are in their Hindu beliefs. At that
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.580]   time, they passed by a very narrow margin, but this time
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.080]   around, I asked the pastors, "What percentage of the political
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:21.880]   party in India now is governed by them?" and he said, "Almost
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:27.380]   87%." They won 87% of the country's support for these
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.680]   radical Hindus. As a result of that, one of the things that
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.880]   they said that they're going to pass this year, probably in
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.780]   the first half of the year, is they're going to make Hindu
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.780]   their national religion, and so I said, "So what does that
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.480]   mean?" They said, "Once it becomes a national religion of
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.680]   the country, they're going to make it illegal to proselytize
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.980]   Hindus," meaning that Christians going in and trying to share
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.580]   the gospel is going to be made officially illegal. Up to this
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.380]   point, the anger has been coming from their neighbors, other
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.480]   Hindus, family members, for trying to convert them, but if
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.880]   they make it a national religion, basically, by law, they
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.680]   cannot go proselytize, and part of the reason why the Muslims
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.580]   don't get attacked is because they don't actively proselytize,
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.680]   so even though they live out their faith, they're not being
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.380]   targeted for that reason, but Christians, obviously, our
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.080]   pastors and many other pastors, like our pastors in India,
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.580]   where there's a greatest concentration of unreached people
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.280]   groups, especially in that area that we go to, they are
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.780]   actively bringing the gospel to hostile places, and as
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.380]   difficult as it's been, they all told me that they see real
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.380]   persecution coming in the coming years, so we need to pray
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.080]   for them. The work that we're doing, every year, we're
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.380]   evaluating and praying. We don't want to be reckless, but
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.480]   at the same time, if we're able to help them and even be
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.380]   there to protect them, even for a short period of time, we
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.080]   feel that it's worthwhile to help them to share the
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.680]   gospel. I know some of you guys have been praying. Many of
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.480]   you guys have been financially supporting, and all of
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.580]   this is not a penny is being wasted. It's going to a good
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.080]   cause where God is being glorified. The gospel is literally
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.880]   being taken to villages where there is no church. Now, I
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   say all of this not simply as an opening, not simply as
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.680]   an update to what happened out in India, but everything
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.280]   that we do, everything that we do, everything that we
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.280]   study in the New Testament is in the context of God
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:42.880]   pursuing sinners. You will miss a huge part of even
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.180]   properly understanding the Bible when we are disengaged
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.680]   with the Great Commission. When we look at Scripture as
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.680]   a how to raise children, how to have a good church, how
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.280]   to build community, how to disciple people to be good
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.180]   Christians, and when that is disengaged with the Great
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.080]   Commission, it becomes self-centered. It's like the
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.380]   mission that God has placed the church in, not participating
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.080]   in that mission, and yet we still want God to walk with
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:16.780]   us and bless us. As difficult as it is in India, what we
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.880]   see out in India looks a lot more like what the Bible
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.780]   describes a Christian life looks like. Read the
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.880]   Scriptures, the warnings that Jesus gave. They hated
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   me, so they're going to hate you. Don't be surprised
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.580]   if they persecute you because they persecuted me. He
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.680]   told us that we're not of this world. Our enemy is
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.380]   like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour, so what
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.180]   they are experiencing in India looks a lot more like
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.080]   what we see in Scripture than the Christian life that
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   you and I experience here. What has become normal
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.680]   Christian life in our generation, we have to admit,
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.380]   doesn't look much like what we see in Scripture. In
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.880]   fact, we have to kind of distort it. We have our own
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.580]   standards of what is good, what is right, what makes
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.780]   a church healthy or not healthy. All of that had to
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:10.080]   be tweaked and contextualized to meet an Orange County
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.480]   Christian middle-class life. What's strange in the
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.880]   Bible is not what India is experiencing. It's what
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.480]   you and I are experiencing. If there's any kind of
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.680]   tweaking that needs to be made, it's not what's
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.080]   happening out in India. It's what's happening here.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   So, you know, sometimes experiencing what these
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.680]   pastors go through, at least for a short period of
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.480]   time, kind of recalibrates. I think every single one
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.780]   of us would admit who's been there, kind of
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.180]   recalibrates because it affects our fellowship, it
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.080]   affects our gathering, it affects our prayer life, it
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.280]   affects our devotions, it affects our work, our
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.480]   gifting, our sacrifice. Ask any one of them that's
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   been on these trips. We feel a sense of true church,
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.680]   like what God called us to be as a church in the
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:03.480]   context of what we do out in India. The challenge
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.080]   is how do we bring this home? How do we make that
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.280]   church that we experienced for a short period of
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   time a church that becomes normal, that that's
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.380]   the standard that we are shooting for, right? Now
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.480]   what we do out in India is not just a one week out
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.280]   of the year we sacrifice to be there and
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.980]   experience that and say, "Oh, that was good. We did
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.280]   something good." But how do we make that the
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.180]   normal Christian life that we are to live here?
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.980]   Everything that Jesus has done, everything that
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.580]   we've studied up to this point, everything that
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.380]   we will study today, everything that we will
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.480]   study going forward, it's all in the context of
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.080]   God pursuing sinners. So if you are detached from
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.180]   that somehow, it's kind of like, you know, that's
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.780]   for the pastors and that's for the outreach team.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.680]   You are completely detached from the Christian
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.680]   life. And because you are detached from the
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.580]   Christian life, you're going to hear the sermons
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.180]   as a time that you put in. And once you're done
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.080]   with your time, it's just like, "I'm done." You
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.180]   know, go get some coffee, go play with your kids
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.480]   and, you know, do whatever you need to do. But
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.180]   outside of that, it's not relevant. Because the
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.580]   call that God gives us is the same call that the
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.380]   pastors have. They don't have a separate call
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.380]   than we do. They've been called to live a tough
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.380]   life, to share the gospel to people who haven't
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.280]   heard. But thank God that that's not me. Jesus,
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.880]   even in this story, is in the context of pursuing
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.880]   sinners. And let me give you the setting behind
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.680]   what happens. This happens in the city of Nain.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.480]   Nain is in the context of Galilee, maybe about
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.380]   15 miles away from the main area where Jesus
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.380]   has been doing ministry. It's an obscure city,
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.580]   kind of like Nazareth, that is mentioned. This
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.780]   city is mentioned in no other place but is in
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.280]   this particular text in the Gospel of Luke. We
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.380]   would have never known anything about the city
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.780]   outside of the fact that this miracle takes place
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:59.980]   here. Now, it tells us that this miracle of
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.380]   raising this widow's son happens outside of the
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.080]   gate. But what's interesting here is that
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.880]   there's two things that are emphasized and these
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.380]   two crowds coming. One, in verse 11, it says a
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.780]   large crowd accompanied Jesus. And then another
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.780]   large crowd met Jesus at the gate. So you had
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.380]   two clashing of these large crowds that meet.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.680]   Now, the fact that our author, Luke, is telling
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.380]   us about these two large crowds, one, tells us
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.580]   two things. One, Jesus' popularity is growing.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.580]   And we're going to see this crowd growing larger
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.480]   and larger. Can you imagine? Every time I go to
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.280]   India, it reminds me, this is what it must have
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.480]   looked like wherever Jesus went. Because every
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.780]   time we go to the villages, you know, people are
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.780]   crowding at the door. And so initially when we
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.480]   started going out to India, we didn't think we
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.280]   needed bodyguards and we needed doormen to
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.480]   stand by the door and fight off the crowd all day.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.180]   But that's, you know, one of the toughest jobs
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.680]   is our bodyguards, you know, Ella James and
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.980]   Garrett, you know, they got to stand by the door
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.780]   and they're literally fighting off people all
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.080]   day until we leave. And almost never are we
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.180]   done. So at the end of the day, we just have to
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.180]   shut the door and people are disappointed and
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.080]   we just have to pack up and get in our vans and
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.180]   we take off. And that's with a small group of
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.580]   people only there for a few hours. And because
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.780]   they're desperate, we have doctors who are there
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.780]   to see them that a lot of these people don't
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.480]   have access to. So they know that if they don't
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.980]   get through the door, they're going to lose
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.980]   their opportunity. So because of the
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.980]   desperateness and the opportunity they have,
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.380]   they'll bang on the door, they'll try to cut in
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.380]   and, you know, they're always looking for
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.180]   favor and asking the pastors and leaders just
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.280]   kind of walking through and using their position
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.380]   in the village to kind of get an advantage.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.680]   And I can imagine all of that happening
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:58.480]   exponentially larger everywhere Jesus went.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.780]   And Jesus was just one man and he was
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.280]   performing miracles, not just passing out
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.280]   medicine. So can you imagine the crowd? That's
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.680]   why it says in John 6 when Jesus was feeding
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   the 5,000, the actual crowd probably over 20,000
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.080]   people just wouldn't leave him alone. I mean
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.580]   who can blame them? You have a child who's
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.380]   sick, you know, you have a twisted ankle, you
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.180]   have heart failure, you have disease, and you
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.480]   don't have money for medicine. And even
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.280]   if you did, they don't have enough know-how
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.080]   to fix anything. Then all of a sudden Jesus
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.380]   comes and the lame start walking, the blind
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.280]   begin to see. So can you imagine the thousands
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.680]   and thousands and the 12 disciples constantly
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.880]   trying to fight off the crowd? Well, every
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.480]   time we go to India, we see a small glimpse
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.180]   of that and that's exactly what was happening.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.580]   It says Jesus is walking. This is in the earlier
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.280]   part of his ministry. So can you
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.880]   imagine as he is headed toward Jerusalem,
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.080]   how crazy this crowd must have looked like?
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.880]   It says that Jesus is going down to this
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.780]   small town, Nain, and a large crowd followed
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.980]   him. And then it says a sizeable crowd
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.380]   was with the widow. Not only was this
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.280]   crowd growing second, this miracle happened
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.080]   in front of a lot of people. This wasn't
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.780]   hidden behind the doors. And they
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.880]   said, "Oh, it happened!" And he said, "Well, I
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.480]   didn't see it." And he said, "No, you have to
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.080]   believe." I don't know how much of the miracles
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.980]   that people proclaim are happening today,
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.780]   right? It happens behind closed doors. He said,
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.980]   "No, Jesus' miracles would happen in the
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.480]   opening." Because he wanted them to see.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.280]   He wanted them to see who he was. It was
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.480]   evidence of who Jesus was. And so, one,
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.780]   his popularity is growing, and second,
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.480]   that this miracle took place in the open.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.680]   But what's interesting about these two
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   crowds is you can't get a more of
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.580]   a greater contrast between these two crowds
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.780]   because you have this one crowd following
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.680]   Jesus because they see his miracles and
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.380]   there's an excitement that maybe he's the
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.080]   Messiah. And hundreds and possibly thousands
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.180]   are already just constantly trying to
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.080]   get at him. So can you imagine the crowd,
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.480]   the excitement that must have been in that
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.880]   crowd? And then as Jesus is coming, here's
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.780]   another crowd coming out of the city. And
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.780]   this is a funeral march. And so, you know,
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.080]   at that particular time, if people weren't
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.280]   sad, they would have to hire people, you
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   know. And it demonstrated that professional
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.580]   weepers, just to show how missed this person
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.780]   will be. And so typically, a funeral that
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.880]   lasted about seven days at the beginning
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.580]   would start with this procession outside
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.780]   the gate. And people would come out
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.780]   weeping and showing, you know, physical
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.380]   signs of their mourning. So can you
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.980]   imagine this two crowd? One overjoyed,
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.880]   excited anticipation of the Messiah. And
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.680]   here's this other crowd coming mourning
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.380]   and weeping because not only was their
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.180]   death, this is a death of the only son
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.980]   of a widow. The tragedy behind this. And
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.280]   the clash happens. And at the end of this
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.780]   clash, one crowd will succumb to the
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.980]   other. And again, I don't think it's by
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.380]   accident that Luke mentioned this here.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.380]   But what I want to focus on this morning
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.980]   is not simply the setting. The setting
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.380]   is just to help us understand what's
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:38.680]   going on. But Jesus' compassion that led
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.980]   him to do what he did. Now, it mentions
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.380]   kind of in passing, if you only look at
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.080]   this text. But when you look at all the
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.480]   texts and the miracles and the things
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.080]   that Jesus did, right at the center of
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.880]   that, you will see often that Jesus did
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:00.280]   this because he was compassionate. In
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.180]   Luke 7, 10, it says, "Now, as he approached
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.880]   the gate in the city, a dead man was
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.680]   being carried out, the only son of his
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.180]   mother, and she was a widow." So even now
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.680]   in our modern generation, if a widow
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.780]   loses her only son, it would be tragic.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.880]   She's already felt the pain of losing
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.680]   her husband and then now losing her only
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.080]   son. Even in our modern culture, with
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.880]   all the technologies, with all the help,
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.980]   with all the hospitals, maybe even
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.080]   government support, it would still be
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.880]   tragic today. But at this particular time,
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:42.380]   a widower, a widow, without her husband
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.380]   would have been completely helpless. And
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.880]   for that widow, who's already completely
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.180]   helpless, to lose her only son, she has
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.580]   no way to survive. Who's going to take
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.380]   care of her? But on top of the physical
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.180]   problem that she would have, she lived in
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.080]   a period where people automatically
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.380]   thought, just kind of like Job, when all
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.680]   these tragic things were happening,
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.280]   people attributed, "You must have done
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.580]   something wrong. Why would God curse you
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.580]   in this way?" So for a lady to become a
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.880]   widow, and then on top of that, to lose
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.180]   her only son, there must have been
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.780]   something. You must have done something.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.280]   There must have been some hidden sin in
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.680]   you. So you talk about sadness, it's an
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.480]   understatement. In fact, the Scripture
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.580]   highlights the bitterness, the sorrow and
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.180]   pain of losing your only son. Jeremiah
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.880]   6:26 says, "O daughter of my people, put
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.380]   on sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn, as
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.780]   for an only son, a lamentation most
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:50.680]   bitter." A lamentation most bitter. The
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.780]   Bible describes a pain of losing your
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.380]   only son. A lamentation most bitter.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.480]   Zechariah 12.10, it says, "And they will
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.280]   mourn for him, as one mourns for an only
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.180]   son. And they will weep bitterly over him,
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.680]   like the bitter weeping over a firstborn."
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.780]   The Bible emphasizes the bitterness and
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.380]   the sorrow, the deep sorrow, of losing
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.980]   your only son. Now, we know that all of
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.080]   this is a foreshadow of what was coming
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.980]   in Christ. And so, all of this, again,
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.680]   which we'll bring back to later on,
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.180]   there's a purpose behind all of this. But
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.580]   one thing that I want to emphasize here
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:35.380]   is the motive behind why Jesus did what
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.080]   he did. There are certain things that you
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.580]   can do whether you have heart or not,
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.280]   right? If you're an accountant, you do it.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   You don't say, "Oh, I love numbers," and I
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   don't get you, right? But it's your job.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.680]   You're going to get paid. So whether you
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.080]   have a heart for it or not, you just do
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.680]   it. You know, the job needs to get done.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.780]   Certain things you just can't do if you
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:02.080]   don't have a heart. You can't be a parent.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.980]   You can't—it's like, "That's my job."
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.080]   No, they will stretch your job, right?
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.780]   Unless you—there are certain things that
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.680]   you cannot do until you have some sort
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.680]   of compassion or love, right? Marriage is
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.780]   not a contract. It's not a contract unless
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.280]   there is a heart behind it. It's difficult
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   to maintain a relationship with anybody.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.980]   You know, I noticed years ago, I was
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.280]   helping a doctor friend move, and he
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.580]   happened to be in radiology—a radiologist,
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.480]   and he—and I remember in the conversation,
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.580]   he had a bunch of his other, you know,
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.880]   radiologists come, and I asked him,
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.280]   "It must be a hard job, you know, constantly
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.580]   telling people that they have cancer, and
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.880]   you know, they have so many days to live
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.280]   or so many months to live." And I
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.780]   remember one of the doctors said, "Well,
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.580]   you know, after a while, you become callous."
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.880]   And then he explained to me how there
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.280]   have been times when they would tell
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.680]   somebody that your father only has ten
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.980]   days to live, and they would come out
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.980]   and just joking around. And they said, "I
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.380]   know that sounds really bad," but he says,
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.480]   "But that's how it becomes after a while.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.580]   It just becomes your job." Now, to this
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.980]   day, I can't understand how you can
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.680]   get callous to the point where you tell
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.980]   somebody that they're going to die, and
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.880]   then you come out, like, joking around.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.080]   But I've talked to police
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.780]   officers. I've talked to other people in
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.380]   healthcare professions. I've talked to
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.480]   guys who came from war. If they don't
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.880]   harden their heart, they can't do their
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.680]   job. There are certain things that you
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.880]   just cannot do until your compassion is
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.880]   ignited. What Jesus does, what God has
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.780]   done for sinners, cannot be understood
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.380]   outside of his compassion. It cannot be
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.780]   understood. It's not
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.280]   logical. It doesn't make any sense. You
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.780]   can't calculate and try to find a reason
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.680]   behind why he did until you understand
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.380]   that it was moved by compassion. In Luke
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.480]   7:13, he said, "When the Lord saw her, he
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   felt compassion for her and said to her,
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:24.680]   'Do not weep. Do not weep.'" He had
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.580]   compassion for that lady. In fact, in
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.380]   Matthew 9:36, Jesus, seeing the multitudes,
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.180]   he said he felt compassion for them
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.480]   because they were distressed and
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.180]   dispirited, like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.380]   If you try to engage the Great
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.880]   Commission without compassion, all you
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.680]   become is a salesperson. You have a
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.980]   product that you're trying to sell, and
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.880]   you don't think people can see right
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:58.880]   through that? You're not trying to
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.780]   convince a sinner to turn from his sins
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.080]   and be saved. There's tragedy waiting
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.680]   for them. You're presenting a bunch of
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.080]   information. I've done my job. I checked
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.680]   off the mark and it's time for you to go.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.280]   You don't think people notice that? You
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.880]   cannot engage in the Great Commission
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.280]   until there is compassion, until you see
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.980]   it through the lens that God gives you,
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.180]   and you see the tragic situation of
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.480]   lost sinners. Jesus says, because he had
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.880]   compassion, he compelled the disciples to
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.080]   beseech the Lord of the Harvest. In
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.380]   Matthew 14, 14, when he went ashore, he
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.680]   saw a large crowd and felt compassion
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.880]   for them and healed their sick. He didn't
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:41.980]   say, "You know, I need to heal the sick
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.080]   because I need to show them who I am
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.880]   and to demonstrate my power." All of that
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.780]   is true, but the scripture says what
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:53.580]   moved him to action was compassion. He
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.080]   saw their pain. He saw their pain and he
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.980]   wanted to do something about it. That's
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.380]   the reason it says in Mark 1, 40, why he
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.780]   healed the leper. That's the reason in
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.980]   Mark 5, 1, where he cast out the demon
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.480]   possessed. That's the reason why he healed
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.280]   the two blind men in Matthew 20, 30 to 34.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:15.580]   It says all motivated by compassion. In
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.180]   fact, when Jesus stands at the grave of
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:22.680]   Lazarus, he says he wept over. He saw the
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.880]   pain of the people who were crying over
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.680]   the death of Lazarus. As Jesus rides a
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.980]   donkey into Jerusalem, Jesus sees
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:34.380]   judgment coming upon them and he weeps
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:40.380]   over the nation of Israel. What Jesus
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.180]   does makes no sense if we don't
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.880]   understand the compassion of God. So the
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.980]   mystery of the cross is why does he have
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:57.280]   compassion? Why? Let me illustrate this
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.580]   to help us understand. Because logically,
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.780]   you know, as I've mentioned to you many
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.680]   times, that there's so many things I
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.680]   learned trying to work with the homeless
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.180]   people. After a few years of trying to
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.180]   help them off the street, I realized a
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:15.980]   lot of them were not interested in
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.880]   getting off the street. It used to really
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.480]   frustrate me because I have finances, I
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.180]   have people willing to help you, willing
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.380]   to house you for free, help you get a
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.580]   job and get back on your feet. And after
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.780]   attempting this a few times, I realized
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:34.280]   these guys are not interested. And I'm
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.680]   not saying every single one, but a huge
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.080]   chunk of them. And I realized a lot of
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.280]   them had vices that they got themselves
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.080]   into. Typically alcohol or some kind of
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:48.480]   drugs. And after a while, you start
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.080]   to lose compassion. You did that to
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.280]   yourself. And I know as many of you may
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.880]   look at that and say, "Don't give
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.080]   money. That's a waste of money." Because
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.580]   they did that to themselves. If you give
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:49:59.680]   them money, they're gonna go and buy
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.080]   drugs. So why? Why do we need to help? It
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.680]   doesn't make any sense. You're wasting
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:14.580]   money. Until, until that's somebody you
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:18.580]   love. So that's your father or your
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.780]   mother or brother or sister or your son.
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.580]   So compassion isn't based upon do they
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:30.180]   deserve it. Compassion isn't based upon
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.480]   well if we do this that they're gonna
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.280]   clean up and there's a they're gonna
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.180]   become something better. Compassion
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.080]   simply happens because they're in need.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.480]   Because you care. God didn't look at us
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:46.580]   and say, "Well you know like something
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.580]   tragic happened to you and I want to
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:49.980]   help you from your difficult situation
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.780]   that maybe if I pour enough love into
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.180]   you you're gonna become this great
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.180]   disciple of mine and share the gospel
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.380]   and you can become this great light." No.
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.680]   God showed compassion because you and I
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:07.080]   needed it. Period. Period. He saw us and
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.880]   just like we could look at homeless
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.580]   people who are hooked on drugs and say
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:16.080]   you did that to yourself. You did that to
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.380]   yourself. You don't deserve my money. You
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.580]   don't deserve grace. How many sinners in
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.580]   this room didn't do that to ourselves?
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.780]   Couldn't God have easily looked at us
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.580]   and said, "You did that to yourself. You
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:35.980]   rebelled. You chose to go against me. You
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:39.680]   want me to pour my grace into you?" But
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.480]   God didn't look upon us that way. He saw
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   us as desperate sinners. We're in need.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.080]   And for whatever the reason, instead of
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.880]   being disgusted, He was compassionate.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:02.780]   Instead of turning away, He came. How
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.580]   easily for us, if we know some selfish
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:09.180]   person is coming into our life, we stiff
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.480]   arm them. If we know the stink coming, "Oh,
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.580]   I have a bad experience. I know this. I
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.180]   know what's coming next." Our natural
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.880]   instinct is to keep our distance from
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:23.980]   them. Now, if God did that to us, none of
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.580]   us would be here. You know, even our
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:31.780]   compassion is limited by our own sin. It's
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.380]   limited by our own sin because we don't
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.780]   fully understand. We tend to have
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.380]   compassion from our perspective. And we
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.980]   tend to have compassion for people that
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.780]   we think are lower than us. That's why we
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.980]   focus attention on the poor, but we don't
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.980]   have compassion for the rich. Because
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.780]   it's like, "Oh, they have less than I do."
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.780]   And then we're prejudiced. There are certain
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:56.080]   people that we can have compassion
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.380]   because they think, "Oh, they're lovable."
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.780]   So we have more compassion for orphans
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.180]   because they're cuter. So even the way we
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.880]   practice compassion is limited by our
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.980]   own sinfulness. But Jesus is omniscient.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.580]   He knows all things. He's all-powerful. So
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:15.780]   even His compassion is based upon full
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:20.880]   knowledge. If we knew, you know, some of
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.380]   the people that we feel compassion for,
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.480]   if we knew what they were like behind
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.780]   the scene, if we knew all their sins, if
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.180]   we knew the filth that they've been
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.580]   trying to hide, if they knew all the
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.680]   filth that you and I tried to hide, would
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.580]   they be so compassionate toward us? God
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.380]   knew all of that. Jesus knows all of that.
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.480]   Their sins, past, present, and future.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:47.380]   Omniscient God, and yet He saw the plight
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:51.780]   of man, and He had compassion. In Hebrews
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.780]   chapter 415, it says, "For we did not have
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.680]   a high priest who cannot sympathize with
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.980]   our weaknesses, but one who has been
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.080]   tempted in all things as we are, yet
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:05.380]   without sin." Jesus didn't just stand from
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.280]   a distance and was crucified. He said He
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.980]   walked among us so that we may
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.380]   recognize Him as a sympathetic high
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:16.480]   priest, that He can relate to us, and we can
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.380]   relate to Him. You know, what's
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.380]   interesting is most biblical scholars
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.580]   believe that Jesus lost his earthly
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.280]   father, Joseph, when he was young, and
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.480]   that's why we don't see Joseph when he's
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.580]   an adult. We see Mary all over the place,
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.380]   but we don't see Joseph. So they believe
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.380]   that Jesus experienced losing his father
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.280]   at an early age, and being the firstborn,
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.580]   that he was probably responsible for
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.080]   taking care of his mom and his siblings
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:48.480]   since a young age. So Jesus experienced
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.080]   the pain of losing the father. Jesus
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.280]   experienced the pain of taking care
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.880]   of his widowed mother. Where we
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.180]   see the heart of Jesus is as Jesus is
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.680]   hanging on the cross in John chapter
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.480]   19, 26-27. One of the last things that
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.680]   Jesus says on the cross is his concern
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.080]   for his mom. In John 19, 26-27, when Jesus
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.080]   then saw his mother and the disciples
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.280]   whom he loved standing nearby, he said
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.580]   to his mother, "Woman, behold your son."
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.080]   Then he said to the disciple, "Behold
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.480]   your mother." From that hour, the disciples
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.080]   took her into his own household. As he's
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.580]   hanging on the cross, he asked John, the
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:35.980]   apostle, "Please take care of my mom." That
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.180]   was one of the last things that he said.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:44.180]   Jesus knew what it was like. And he had
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.280]   looked at us and said, "Our sympathetic
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.280]   high priest has compassion for us." And
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   that's why when he sees this lady crying,
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.180]   he has compassion. He says, "Stop crying."
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.880]   Now that, outside of the context, is like
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.180]   a very insensitive thing to say. She just
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.880]   lost her son. They stopped crying. But
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.480]   obviously, Jesus is telling her to
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.280]   stop crying, not simply because, "Hey,
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.280]   suck it up. Things will get better."
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.780]   You know, oftentimes we try to encourage
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.180]   one another with words, and sometimes
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.580]   they're more painful. It's better not to
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.080]   say anything. You know, somebody who's
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.580]   gone through tragedy say, "You know, God
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.580]   works all things together for good." And
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.580]   sometimes that brings more pain because
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.180]   it feels trivial. You don't know what's
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.080]   going on. You don't know the pain that
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.880]   that person's going through. So it's
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.080]   highly insensitive to tell somebody to
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:39.380]   stop crying, stop weeping. Yet Jesus says
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:43.680]   that because he knows what's coming. When
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.380]   he says, "Be anxious for nothing," he's not
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.180]   just throwing empty words. That's a
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:51.080]   sovereign God telling us, "Be anxious for
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.780]   nothing because I've got the future." And
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.280]   he does something amazing here. He
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.980]   touches the coffin of the dead. Now, again,
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.980]   outside of the context, that may not mean
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.180]   a whole lot, but you have to understand
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.180]   the reason why this funeral procession
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.880]   is happening outside the gate is because
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.480]   they can't bury dead people in the city.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.980]   Because if you even come upon the grave
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:15.980]   of somebody dead, it would make you
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.780]   unclean. So you have to isolate yourself
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.180]   and you can't fellowship and you can't
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:24.380]   be in the community. So as soon as the
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.080]   person died, immediately they would wrap
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.680]   the body up, put him in a coffin, and have
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.080]   to take him out of the outside of the
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.880]   outside of the city walls. And if you
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.780]   were rich, you found a cave and then you
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.380]   would bury it and you make clear signs
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.480]   that that's the grave so nobody runs
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.180]   upon it accidentally and become unclean.
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.380]   If you're poor, they dug a hole, put a
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.080]   mound on it, and put a clear sign so that
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.680]   anybody who is walking in this area
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.380]   would know to avoid this. So if you're
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.780]   just coming into contact near the grave
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.880]   makes you unclean, can you imagine the
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.180]   shock when Jesus actually places his
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:00.780]   hand on the coffin of the dead man? How
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:05.180]   can he do that? And yet, not only does
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.280]   Jesus do that, in John chapter 6, Jesus
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.180]   says, "If you do not drink of my blood and
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:13.780]   eat of my flesh, I have no relationship
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:15.680]   with you." There's nothing more sacrilegious
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.780]   than drinking the blood of another human
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.280]   being. That's what the pagans did in the
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:26.180]   worship of their demons. And yet Jesus
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:29.380]   said, "You must drink of my blood." Only
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:32.680]   the touch of Christ makes what is unclean
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:38.180]   clean. Only the touch of Christ, instead
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:40.880]   of making him unclean, he would make them
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.580]   clean. You and I live in a sinful society
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.680]   where all have sinned and fall short of the
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.780]   glory of God. The problem is you and I
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.180]   tend to sin when people sin against us.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:58.380]   If they slander us, it triggers us to
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:02.580]   slander them. If they hit us, it triggers
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.780]   us to hit them. If they're selfish, it
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:09.180]   triggers us to be selfish. But that's how
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.880]   you and I act. If we're sinned against,
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.580]   we tend to sin against them. But the
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.580]   problem is we're surrounded by sinners.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:21.480]   And we are filled with sin. And so sin
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:24.680]   gets perpetuated from generation to
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.780]   generation, from husband to wife, from
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.480]   parents to children, and on and on and
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.880]   on. And yet Christ jumps in to this
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.880]   sinful generation, and he lives amongst
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:45.780]   sinful people. And by his touch, the curse
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:49.880]   is reversed. Jesus is the only human
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.680]   being that walks on this earth that is
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.380]   able to absorb our sins. And instead of
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.880]   reacting and becoming unclean, he makes
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:04.080]   us clean. That's the gospel. That's Jesus'
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.980]   touch. What may have shocked people of
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.680]   what he was doing actually raises the
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.980]   man. And as a result of that, can you
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.680]   imagine what happens? This crowd that
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.380]   came out mourning and weeping all of a
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.580]   sudden turned into rejoicing and
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:23.980]   celebration. And the crowd that followed
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.580]   Jesus engulfs the crowd that came out of
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.680]   town. And can you imagine the celebration
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.880]   as they walk back into town with that
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.380]   young man raised? And how thankful that
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:42.080]   that widow must have been. Well, the
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.580]   scripture tells us, "The dead man sat up
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.280]   and began to speak, and Jesus gave him
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.480]   back to his mother. Fear gripped them all,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.580]   and they began to glorify God, saying, 'A
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.080]   great prophet has arisen among us, and
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.880]   God has visited his people.'" You know
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.880]   what's interesting here? Is that in the
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.580]   midst of this celebration, it says, "Fear
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.180]   gripped them." For whatever the reason, we
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.280]   think fear and celebration, fear and joy,
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.380]   they don't go together. In fact, the Bible
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.280]   says, "No, fear and celebration, true
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.580]   celebration, always is accompanied by
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:23.480]   fear of God." We have perverted the
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.080]   gospel to the point where we think
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.280]   holiness and grace somehow contradict
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.880]   each other. That if we're a gracious
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.280]   community, that we allow some level of
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   sin. That we should be okay with that
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.680]   because we're gracious, because God is
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.680]   loving. So somehow we perverted the
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.180]   gospel to accept the fact that unholiness
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.880]   means that God's presence is greater
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.480]   because his love is abounding. True
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.680]   revival always brings fear and awe of
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.880]   God. True revival. Because the moment you
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.580]   are aware of God's presence, all your
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.180]   hidden sins, all the things that you've
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.880]   covered, all the things that you have
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   swept under the rug, all of a sudden
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.980]   becomes filthier than you've ever known.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.080]   Because you begin to see it from the
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.580]   lens of a holy God. It is the grace of
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.280]   God that causes you to see the
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.680]   sinfulness of your own heart, which
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.280]   causes the fear and awe that leads you
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:43.580]   to repentance, which triggers his
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.280]   forgiveness. But for whatever the reason,
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.680]   our generation has passed through
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.580]   repentance through forgiveness. The grace
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:56.280]   of God has forgiven you. Notice the
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.480]   grace of God that causes you to sin, see
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.880]   sin as God sees sin, then leads you to
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.280]   repentance, which leads you to forgiveness.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.880]   They said when this happened, it wasn't
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.480]   just, "Oh, a great miracle happened. Thank
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.880]   God that this only son is raised." They
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.380]   said, "No, God had visited us. God was in
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:27.080]   our midst." And how did God get glorified?
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.980]   He said, "In the midst of this fear, they
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.980]   began to glorify God." In Psalm 36 1, it
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.680]   says, "Transgression speaks to the
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.380]   ungodly within his heart. There is no
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:42.480]   fear of God before his eyes." The reason
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.280]   why people feel comfortable in their sin
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.780]   is because there's no fear of God. They
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.880]   don't know God. They're not aware of the
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.980]   presence of God. God is just a theory.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.180]   God is just a thought. God is just
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.580]   something that you were taught in your
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.380]   nominal Christian home. He's not real. But
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.780]   the moment you encounter God,
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.580]   you will never feel comfortable in your
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.680]   sin. You will never feel comfortable in
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.980]   your sin. And that's exactly what happens.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:23.980]   Revival breaks out. Revival breaks out
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:26.880]   because they recognize that God visited
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:34.080]   them. That's the compassion of Jesus.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:39.780]   His compassion doesn't allow us to live
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.780]   in sin and continue to embrace the world.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.180]   It's like, "Oh, God is compassionate. He's
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.180]   loving. There's nothing we can do
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.180]   that can make God happier." It's because
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.780]   He loves us, He rebukes us. Because He
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:01.080]   loves us, He calls us out of darkness. And
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.480]   it is because of His compassion, it's
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.980]   because of His compassion, He will not
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:11.680]   allow us to chase the world. He calls us,
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.580]   He calls us to bring others into the
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:23.380]   light. True life, true life can only be
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:29.280]   found at the center of the will of God.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:36.880]   Please let that sink in. If you've been
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.980]   given, if you've given to think that if
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.380]   you can just save it, if you can just
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.880]   buy the house at the right time, if you
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.480]   can just buy the stock at the right time,
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.980]   if you can just marry the right person,
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.280]   if you can just do this and do that, if
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.480]   I can just have that, life will be so
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.880]   much better. You've been lied to. You have
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.080]   embraced the deception. Even in your
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.380]   wildest dream, if it comes true, you will
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.080]   die. And everything that you have
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.780]   achieved in this life, you will regret.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.680]   You will regret it, I guarantee you, you
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.780]   will regret it. Everything that you are
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:14.080]   pursuing outside of God, you will one
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.280]   day wake up. If God is merciful enough to
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.380]   wake you up, you will live in eternity in
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.080]   regret of how you spent your days on
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:29.680]   this life. True life is only found in the
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.280]   center of the will of God. That joy you
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.980]   feel because you have a new car, that joy
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.980]   you feel because you've redecorated your
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.880]   house, that joy you feel because you're
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.280]   able to go somewhere to forget the
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.380]   experience, all of that one day at the
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:50.480]   end of your life, you will regret if
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   Christ is not at the center of your life,
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:02.480]   if he's not your Lord. You will regret
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.580]   every Christian game that you played,
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:10.280]   every hypocrisy that you have embraced,
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.680]   every fake face that you put on for
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.680]   other people to see, every reputation
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.180]   that you've gained to be righteous,
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.680]   knowing full well that you have sinned,
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   that you are unrepenting in. Only at the
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.480]   center of the will of God will you find
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:36.380]   true life. Psalm 30, 11-12, "You have
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.180]   turned for me my mourning into dancing,
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.080]   you have loosed my sackcloth and girded
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.480]   me with gladness, that my soul may sing
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.980]   praise to you and not be silent. Oh Lord
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:52.680]   my God, I will give thanks to you forever."
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.880]   Let's pray.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:12.180]   Lord, if we have embraced the lie that
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.980]   because we are healthy, because our bills
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:21.980]   are paid, and our children are laughing,
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:27.280]   that all is good, help us Lord God, open
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:33.080]   our eyes to see that we are in the midst
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.780]   of waiting for the judgment of God to
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.780]   come, that we will not live like the rest
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.180]   of the world. As you had compassion for
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:46.980]   us, help us to see the people who are
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.280]   lost in this world with compassion. As
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:54.680]   you didn't turn away from our ugliness,
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.980]   help us not to turn away from the
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:01.580]   ugliness of this world. That we may love
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:04.580]   them, pray for them, intercede for them,
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:10.080]   as you did for us. Help us to fix our
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:15.780]   eyes so firmly on Christ who has come,
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:20.980]   on Christ that you have promised to be
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.980]   with us to the end of the age, and in the
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:30.380]   Christ that will come in full glory when
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:34.980]   it is time. Our life, our thoughts, our
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:40.180]   finances, our family, our children, that
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.480]   we may live our lives fully for the
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.380]   purpose of your glory. In Jesus' name we
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.280]   pray, Amen. Let's all stand up for the
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.880]   closing praise.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:10:01.880]   [Music]
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:24.880]   [Music]
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:49.880]   The grace of God has reached for me, and pulled me from the raging sea. And I am safe on this solid ground. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:11:03.880]   [Music]
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:31.880]   I will not fear when darkness falls. His strength will help me still these walls. I'll see the dawn of the rising sun. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:56.880]   Who is like the Lord our God? Strong to save, faithful in love. My debt is paid, and the victory won. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:10.880]   [Music]
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:38.880]   When my hope is hidden though, He has each promise of His word. When winter fades, I know spring will come. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:13:05.880]   Who is like the Lord our God? Strong to save, faithful in love. My debt is paid, and the victory won. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:16.880]   [Music]
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:44.880]   Glory be to God the Father. Glory be to God the Son. Glory be to God the Spirit. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:14:13.880]   Glory be to God the Father. Glory be to God the Son. Glory be to God the Spirit. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:41.880]   Who is like the Lord our God? Strong to save, faithful in love. My debt is paid, and the victory won. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:53.880]   The Lord is my salvation. The Lord is my salvation.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:15:08.880]   [Music]
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.880]   Let's pray.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:32.880]   Gracious Father, as you had compassion on the widow, we know, Father God, that to this day, that it is because of your compassion that the world is not consumed.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   Help us, Lord God, to understand this compassion, to celebrate, and to be thankful. It would lead us to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:52.880]   Help us, Lord God, not to be so entangled with civilian affairs. Help us to know, Father, how fleeting this life is.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:16:12.880]   Remind us how our life is truly like a mist. That whether we are young, middle-aged, or seniors, help us to know, Father God, that our home is not here.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:22.880]   That one day we will be home. That we would live our lives, Lord God, as ambassadors in this dark world.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   As you warned us, that as a wickedness will increase, that love of many, or most, will grow cold.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:43.880]   Lord, we are tempted. Lord, at times we have succumbed. But help us, help us, Lord God, that our love would not grow cold.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   That we would love you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. That we may also love our neighbors as ourselves.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:17:00.880]   Send us, that we may be your ambassadors wherever we go. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   God sent his Son. They called him Jesus.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:29.880]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:38.880]   An empty grave is there to put my Savior there.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:48.880]   Because he lived, I can face tomorrow.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:57.880]   Because he lived, all fear is gone.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:06.880]   Because I know, he holds the future.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:15.880]   And life is worth the living, just because he lived.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:24.880]   This is amazing grace. This is unfailing love.
