[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   (silence)
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.300]   By now, my guess is that many of you, if not most of you, have heard
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.540]   about what happened to a very famous pastor that wrote a book when he was young,
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.820]   became an international bestseller, and he's been a very influential pastor
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.780]   since he was in his early 20s, and he's publicly come out and denounced his faith.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.620]   And he says that he's separating from his wife, and he's no longer a Christian.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.220]   He's walking away from his faith.
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.300]   Now, if you are a young Christian, you may have never seen that before.
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.860]   And say, "What? Somebody at that level, who was that influential,
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.000]   could just walk away from his faith? And so, if that can happen to him,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.980]   could that not happen to me? Could that not happen to you?"
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.980]   And that is a natural question that we should be asking.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.880]   And the warning that we are given in the Scripture, in Hebrews, is that exact warning.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.960]   No one is exempt from that.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220]   The next question that may come from that is, if somebody like him can fall,
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.360]   and just come out and just publicly denounce his faith,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.240]   can a Christian who seemed like he was a genuine Christian just walk away from his faith?
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.300]   So, is he really saved? Can a Christian lose his salvation?
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.680]   And let me make that absolutely crystal clear.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.740]   The Scripture is not ambiguous about that. It is not ambiguous about that.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.180]   I don't care who tells you what book you've read.
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.820]   The Scripture is absolutely crystal clear about that.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.620]   We did not earn our salvation, so you cannot lose your salvation. That is clear.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.300]   Now, if you hear that, some non-Christians, and maybe very, very young Christians may hear that,
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.500]   "Well, then I don't need to really hold fast. I don't need to work hard.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.380]   What's the point of being diligent? What's the point of fearing if the point of the Gospel message is,
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.720]   'You didn't do anything, so you don't have to do anything, and you're going to persevere.'"
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.080]   That is not what the Scripture says.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.280]   In fact, the text that we're looking at is warning us not to drift.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.360]   It says that we ought to fear so we do not fall short of the rest that is promised in Christ.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.660]   That we need to be diligent to enter this rest.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.400]   And today it says we need to hold fast to the promises that we've been giving.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.840]   And then next week we'll be talking about, "Let us therefore draw near."
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.340]   So, the command not to drift is coupled with, "Let us."
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.380]   This is what we ought to do, and to do it with all our might.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.840]   Then how do we reconcile this with the question of,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   if you're genuinely saved, that you can never truly lose your salvation?
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.720]   You can be stretched. You can walk away.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.560]   You may, for a period, be dry in your faith, but you can never lose your salvation.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.860]   The reason why you can never lose your salvation is because
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.640]   you can't have your eyes opened and then have it shut by your will.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.180]   Meaning, I can't look at the truth and then, because of my struggles,
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.240]   and all of a sudden say, "You know, I'm just going to close my eyes to this truth."
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.680]   If you are a genuine believer, and God opened your eyes,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.520]   and you saw and experienced the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.020]   you can't one day, just because it's hard, say,
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.300]   "You know what? I'm going to pretend like I never saw that.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.460]   I'm going to pretend that I never heard that.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.940]   I'm going to pretend that I don't believe this."
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.140]   If an individual is capable of losing his salvation,
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.440]   you would have lost it already.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.480]   Let me make that very clear.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.880]   If you are capable of losing your salvation, you would have lost it already.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.480]   Think about how many times, if you've been a Christian for more than a few years,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.620]   that you've drifted away from God.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.060]   You may have been discouraged, something tragic may have happened,
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.760]   or you just kind of drifted so far away that you could have seen yourself,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.100]   if you kept on going down that path, to have just said, "You know what?
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.360]   Maybe I don't believe."
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.600]   If you've been a Christian for any period of time, you could probably think of one,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.180]   two, or maybe several times in your life.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.580]   If you've been a Christian for more than 5, 10 years, several times in your life,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.040]   you say, "You know what? I didn't live like a Christian at that time.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.620]   I could have easily seen myself drift out and just fall away."
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.260]   So my question is, what caused you to stay?
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.120]   What caused you to stay?
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.660]   What caused you to say, "This is not the right path,
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.520]   that I need to get back on the right path."
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.440]   Was it sheer will?
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.940]   Was it because you were more moral than other people?
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.040]   Was it stronger discipline?
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.420]   No, in the end, God opened your eyes, and you couldn't deny what you believe.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.920]   If you're not a believer, and you begin to drift away from God,
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.480]   you feel perfectly fine going that direction.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.560]   You feel perfectly fine.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.880]   In fact, you're drifting toward where you feel the most comfortable.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.900]   So there is no fear.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.400]   So when you hear this warning today, if you hear His voice, "Do not harden your
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.920]   heart," because there's no faith in you, it doesn't incite any kind of fear
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.720]   or warning.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.400]   I'm just headed down that path, and I feel comfortable.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.880]   So you just kind of grab on to any loose theology, "One saved, always saved,"
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.600]   and that's enough.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.960]   It's not because you genuinely believe it.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.760]   Christianity, all it is, is a security blanket, and that's all you need.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.840]   Because it's not real.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.960]   It's not about the truth.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.840]   It's not about glorifying God.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.960]   It's just, "I just want to make sure that I just want to have insurance."
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.040]   If you're not a believer, you will drift.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.960]   And the warnings that you hear in the book of Hebrews, you'll hear it,
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.880]   you'll remember it, but it's not going to cause you to turn.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.200]   Because you feel very comfortable where you're drifting to.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.760]   So whether that happens in a single day when you publicly denounce and say,
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.000]   "I don't believe this," or whether that happens in years and years and years
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.480]   of just drifting, and your heart has become so cold that none of the word
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.760]   of God makes any sense.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.960]   But if you are a believer, no matter how far you have drifted,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   when the word of God is taught and is warned, it causes you to say,
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   "Oh, shoot, this is not who I am.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.560]   This is not where I belong."
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.360]   And it causes a fear, a sense of reverence toward the things
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   that you hear.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   A sense of urgency is incited in us when the word of God is taught because it
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.440]   judges the thoughts and intentions of our heart, and then it challenges us
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.800]   in the previous passage.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.280]   So if you hear His voice and you do not harden your heart, let us be diligent.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.320]   And that's the next step.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.360]   That we need to be diligent.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's not enough for us to be convicted.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.800]   It is not enough for us to say, "You know what?
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.400]   I believe this truth, and I'm headed down the wrong path."
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.480]   And then go Monday through Saturday, do the exact same thing.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.160]   Right?
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.040]   You've probably heard that cliche that insanity is doing the same thing all the
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.400]   time and expecting a different outcome.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.520]   That's proof of unbelief, that you feel guilty and I ought to do this,
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   but there is absolutely no change, there is no diligence that the word
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.360]   of God incites.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.120]   The text that we're looking at today challenges us in the third
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.940]   "Let Us" statement.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.200]   If you hear the word of God and you've been drifting, it says, "Let us fear."
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.400]   And if you have this reverence and there's a sense of urgency that is sparked
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.320]   in you, then let us be diligent.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.400]   And if you are committed to be diligent, he says, "Let us then hold fast to the
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.160]   confession that we have heard."
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.320]   There is a difference between somebody who is just confessing versus somebody
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.800]   who is holding fast.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.560]   We see that difference in Revelation 3, 1-3, this rebuke to the
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.280]   church of Sardis.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.360]   "He who has seven spirits of God and the seven stars says this,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.560]   'I know your deeds, but that you have a name that you are alive,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.800]   but you are dead.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.760]   Wake up and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die,
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.840]   for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of my God.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.880]   So remember what you have received and heard and keep it and repent.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.360]   Therefore, if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief and you will
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.160]   not know at what hour I will come to you."
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.920]   If you're not a believer, there is nothing to keep.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.240]   There is nothing to hold fast.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.400]   If all that we have is a facade, if all we've been doing is jumping
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.040]   through the hoops so that we can feel like we are part of this community,
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   you can only keep and you can only hold fast if something was already
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.920]   given to you.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.760]   And so, therefore, he's talking to the church.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   He says, "Remember, if you have received this confession and you genuinely
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.480]   believe it," he says, "to hold fast."
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.040]   Why do we need to hold fast?
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.360]   Why is this so urgent?
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.680]   Well, he says in the previous passages, in Hebrews 3.6, "Christ was faithful as a
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.120]   son over his house, whose house we are."
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.640]   In other words, we are his children, "if we hold fast our confidence and the
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.880]   boast of our hope firm until the end."
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.160]   If we hold fast.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.720]   It is not enough to have confessed it 10 years ago, five years ago,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.360]   or a year ago, to publicly confess it in our baptism and say,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.720]   "This is what Christ did to me.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.600]   That was my confession."
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:35.760]   But he says, "Perseverance in our faith is the proof that you have genuine salvation."
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.640]   That's why he says to hold fast.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.880]   If God opened your eyes and you've genuinely seen the glory of the gospel
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.840]   of Jesus Christ, you met the risen Savior, he says to hold fast.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.040]   Hebrews 3.14, "For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.800]   beginning of our assurance firm until the end."
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.680]   In case anybody is sitting here thinking, "One saved, always saved,
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.240]   so therefore I just need to relax and just kind of coast along," right?
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.000]   That's a mindset of an unbeliever.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.560]   That's a mindset of somebody who hears this truth and is just drifting,
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.240]   and they're perfectly fine with this drifting because I got this ticket.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.520]   So no matter how far I go, as long as I have this ticket, I'm fine.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.760]   That's not the language of the New Testament.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.440]   New Testament constantly warns us and challenges us.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.960]   If you know Christ, you must hold fast.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.560]   1 Corinthians 15.1-2, "Now I make known to you, brethren,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.280]   the gospel which I preach to you, which also you received and which you
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.440]   also stand, by which you also are saved.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.400]   If you hold fast the word which I preach to you, unless you believed in vain."
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   There's a difference between somebody who confesses and somebody who holds fast.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.600]   That's a difference that is made in the book of James, of a confession of a demon.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.680]   You say that you believe that there's one God.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.560]   Great. Even the demons believe that, and they shudder, and they are in fear.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.800]   Demons have greater faith than most people because they believe that he's one God,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.560]   but it is not saving faith because there's no fruit that comes out of that.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.240]   They don't hold fast, and that's the distinction he's making here.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.720]   If you have confessed it, you must hold fast.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.640]   But there's a second reason why he says to hold fast, not simply because it is the
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:36.800]   proof of our genuine salvation, but because he has already made it possible.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.440]   In verse 14, it says, "Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.160]   through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast."
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:52.960]   So the reason why we need to hold fast is because Jesus has gone through the heavens.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.440]   One of the questions that I asked, right, if you were on Facebook,
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.360]   and I gave a question last night in preparation for today, why is it,
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.080]   "Therefore, therefore," right, in verse 14?
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.040]   So, "Therefore," in verse 14, obviously connects us to what he was saying in verse 13.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.320]   So in verse 12, he says, "You know that famous passage,
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.440]   'The Word of God is living and active,' and then at the end,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.760]   'Judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart,'" and then it ends in verse 13.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.840]   And how you receive verse 13 really depends on where you are in your walk
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.480]   with God right now.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.080]   In verse 13, it says, "And there is no creature hidden from his sight,
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.400]   but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.560]   In other words, God is completely sovereign.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.800]   You can't hide things from God.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.080]   You can hide things from your wife, from your children, from your pastors,
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.240]   from your neighbors, but in the presence of God, we're completely bare.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.640]   There's no thought that you have.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.920]   There's nowhere that you can go.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.080]   No matter how long it's been, there is no depth that you can hide in
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.800]   where God does not already know.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.840]   We could even fool ourselves, but God cannot be fooled.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.720]   Now, when you hear that, and you are an unbeliever who has been
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.760]   drifting away from God, and you don't want to hear it, I like where I am,
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.280]   and I don't want to be disturbed.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:19.720]   I just want encouragement to know that God sees through all the outside facade,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.040]   all the presentations of our goodness, all the religiousness that we present
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.600]   to everybody else every single Sunday.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.520]   If that's where we are, what a suffocating passage, to know that
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.520]   there is no escape.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.800]   See, but verse 13 is connected to verse 14 because he says, "Though the word of God
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.640]   finds us and convicts us, and we cannot hide."
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.800]   It doesn't matter what you say.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.320]   It doesn't matter what your wife says.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.520]   God knows.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.680]   He cuts through all of that, and there's nowhere you can hide.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.400]   But to an individual who is convicted, who's trying to be diligent,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.920]   who's trying to get back on the right track, this passage is a source
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.800]   of great encouragement.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.240]   Because this passage reminds us that no matter where you go,
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.080]   no matter what you have done, God is able to reach you.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.920]   Even when you try to run from God, there is no height, there's no depth
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.600]   that you can go where God is not already there.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.560]   There is no thought.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.880]   There's nothing that you could have said.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.280]   There's nothing that you could have done that God was not already there.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.040]   So if you're a man or a woman running from God, this is a suffocating passage.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.360]   But if you're an individual who's struggling, and you can easily see
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   yourself, I could have done it.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.080]   If we were able to run from God, you would have done this already.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.400]   And if you've been a Christian for any number of years, you know.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.560]   You don't need to listen to me.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.600]   You know yourself.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.880]   You know your sins better than anybody else.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.960]   If God left that up to you, and it was simply of your own will,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.360]   we would have all denied Him already and walked away.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.200]   See, the way that verse 13 is connected to verse 14, after telling us this
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.400]   suffocating passage, he says, "Therefore, since God is everywhere,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.440]   since you can't run from God, since you can't hide from God,
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.840]   therefore, since we have this great high priest who has passed
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.680]   through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, this great high priest,
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.840]   let us hold fast our confession."
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:29.040]   God is not telling us to do anything that God has not already done to us.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.880]   In Philippians 3, 12 through 14, "Not that I have already obtained it or have
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.440]   already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.000]   I was laid hold by Christ Jesus."
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.400]   I'm striving after the very thing that He already gave me.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.160]   Do you notice that?
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.280]   "Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet,
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.960]   but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.720]   ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.040]   in Christ Jesus."
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.880]   I am straining toward the call which He already gave me.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:13.800]   So, a believer is someone who is living out and pursuing what God has already
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   given him.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.560]   That's a genuine believer because our eyes have become open.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.840]   You have tasted the goodness of God, and there's no other taste that can
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.440]   replace it.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.080]   So, if your eyes have been genuinely open, you can't run from God.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.960]   You can't just one day choose to say, "You know what?
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.440]   I'm just going to close my eyes and pretend like I never saw that.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.400]   Pretend like I never met God, and I'm just going to live like an unbeliever."
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.920]   Only an unbeliever can continue to live like an unbeliever.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.760]   Once your eyes have been open, you can't shed it.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.960]   That's what he's saying.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.560]   But this is not just somebody who's confessing, but is an individual who
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.960]   continues to seek after God.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.000]   We love because He loved us.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.640]   He says to be holy because He is holy.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.760]   We are able to suffer because He suffered on our behalf.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:11.520]   And he said, "This God," he says, "Jesus Christ, He came down.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.960]   The great high priest came down, and He went to the heavens for us."
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.280]   You know, we've been studying through the book of Leviticus, and in the book of
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.280]   Leviticus, it makes it very clear, right?
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   You have the office of the priest, and you can't be a priest, you can't serve at the
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.920]   temple and the tabernacle unless you were perfect.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.680]   You couldn't be blind, you couldn't be lame, you couldn't be disfigured in your
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.160]   face, you couldn't be deformed in the limb, you couldn't have broken foot or
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.480]   hand, you couldn't be a hunchback or a dwarf, and it goes on and on.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.280]   If you have eczema or any kind of skin disease, and it may, on the surface,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.320]   it may sound harsh, but the purpose of all of this wasn't simply trying to be cruel
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.400]   to people who are already having a hard time in life.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.760]   Everything that he taught at the tabernacle was an example, was a foreshadow of what
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.280]   was happening up in heaven.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:11.840]   And so, that was an example, it was a shadow of the reality of what Christ was
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.240]   going to do on our behalf.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.360]   So, when he taught that the priest had to be without defect, it was to be embed into
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.680]   the culture of Israel that a sinner could not approach a holy God.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.000]   He had to be without defect.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.720]   So, the physical defect represented sin.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.360]   And so, no sin of any kind can enter into his presence.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.760]   And that was taught for any priest.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.320]   But Jesus was not just any priest.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.400]   The Bible says that he was a high priest.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.360]   A high priest was an individual, one individual.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.800]   It wasn't an office of many, one individual who had to be a descendant
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.280]   of Aaron, and this individual was set apart in his clothing.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.800]   So, every priest had to wear a special clothing while he was administering
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.880]   the sacrifices.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.440]   But a high priest had a special garment.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.200]   And so, as soon as you entered the tabernacle, you could see who the priests
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.680]   are, and you can identify if a high priest walks in, you could immediately,
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.120]   by his clothing, know that that's the high priest.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.040]   He wore a very colorful outfit, and they had a special name called Thumim and
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:23.120]   Umin, and he had to wear that at all times to separate him from other priests.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.880]   But because the high priest was also a man, he had to constantly go through a
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.680]   ritual of cleansing.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.720]   To the nation of Israel, a high priest was connected with more
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.600]   than just a temple.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.280]   In the nation of Israel, the high priests were known to be an office where it
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.440]   represented refuge for them.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.440]   So, you may have heard of the cities of refuge.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.480]   There are six different cities that were set apart in the nation of Israel.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.680]   All of them were spread apart, all of them were uplifted high,
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.560]   and those cities were specifically created so that just in case somebody
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.640]   killed by accident, not murder, but by accident, a relative of the person that
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.240]   was killed, who's called the Avenger of Blood, would want vengeance because he
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.760]   killed a relative, a brother, a sister, or whoever.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.920]   And so, out of anger, he would chase that man.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.840]   And so, that man who kills by accident would run to one of these cities.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.600]   And when he gets to the city, he would be interviewed as to,
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.200]   "Why are you running?"
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.680]   And finds out that he killed somebody by accident, they would open the door,
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.440]   he would be allowed in for protection under the high priest.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.400]   The high priest basically was the owner of these cities.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.440]   And every city in the nation of Israel, every cities of refuge were...
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.720]   The roads that led to these cities were the best roads.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   So, when you see the language in the New Testament, the valleys are made low and...
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.040]   Or the mountains are laid low and the valleys are made high,
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.160]   it's in the language of preparing the roads to go to these cities of refuge.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.880]   And as long as the high priest was alive, they found refuge under his protection.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.560]   So, for the Israelites, the high priest was not just somebody who served
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:13.200]   at the temple, but they equated refuge with high priest.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.760]   So, every time you see the language of high priest, an Israelite would have
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.600]   immediately thought of the city of refuge.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.880]   This is where we go.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.760]   He is the one we run to when we get into trouble.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.400]   And so, Jesus is called the high priest.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.960]   Not just the priest, but a high priest.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.240]   But if you look at the passage carefully here, he's not just the high priest.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.560]   What is he called?
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.640]   He is the great high priest.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.840]   Meaning, he is not like any other priest.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.120]   Not only did he represent us to God,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.240]   not only was he the place of refuge that people ran to, he is distinguished
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.520]   than any other because everything that God did through the tabernacle,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.880]   through the cities of refuge, all of it pointed to him.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.640]   All of it was pointed to him, to Jesus.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:08.680]   So, when the scripture says that you are able to hold fast because Jesus is the
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:14.360]   great high priest, meaning that all the things that were embedded into the culture
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:20.760]   and the life of the nation of Israel, Jesus came and he fulfilled it.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:26.080]   Of all the things that Jesus did, the greatest activity of the high priest
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.400]   was at the Day of Atonement.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.160]   Let me, if you can put up the picture.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.800]   Okay, so that's the picture of the Ark of the Covenant, and on the top of it is the
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.880]   seat of mercy.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.120]   If you can see just to the right, you'll see Harrison Ford.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.480]   All right, so I could have given you a better picture of the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.120]   but I chose this one because this is the movie, Ark of the Covenant.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.080]   This is my wife's favorite movie.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.760]   But anyway, if you remember watching this movie, this is where it's from.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.960]   That's actually a pretty good picture of the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:03.320]   It's crooked, but the point that I'm trying to make was in the holiest of holies,
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.960]   it is a chamber where only the high priest can go in once a year at the Day
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.400]   of Atonement.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.360]   And because he was a man, he had to go through a ritual cleansing himself.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.040]   And once you got in there, you have to hurry up and do your business.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.080]   So you have to take the blood of the bulls, and basically, you sprinkle it
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.720]   on the curtain, and you sprinkle it on the ark, and you sprinkle it on the seat.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.800]   And then after you've done your work, you have to hurry up and get out.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.720]   And only the high priest was able to enter this room once a year.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720]   There's no seat of rest.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.040]   You can't go in there and just kind of hang out.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.760]   In fact, every year, there was a fear that once a high priest entered
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.760]   into this place, that when he confronted this holy God, that he would not live.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.600]   So he actually had to wear a bell.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.200]   That once he went in there, and as long as the bell was ringing, he was safe.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.000]   But if the bell stopped ringing, he did something wrong.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.840]   Maybe he touched something he wasn't supposed to touch.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.320]   Maybe he stayed there too long.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:03.360]   And all of this was to tell the nation of Israel that once you get into the inner
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:10.160]   chamber of where God's glory is magnified, if you do not cover yourself
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   by the blood, you shall surely die.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.680]   That was the duty of all the duties of the high priest.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.160]   That was the greatest of all the duties.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.400]   Now, why is this important for us to understand?
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.920]   Because in Hebrews 9, verse 1, it says, "Now, even the first covenant had
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.040]   regulations of divine worship and earthly sanctuary."
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.600]   And then verse 11, it says, "But when Christ appeared as high priest of the good
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.960]   things to come," in other words, the heavenly things, "that all of that which
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.920]   was preparation to point to what he was going to do, he entered to the greater and
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.120]   more perfect tabernacle not made with hands."
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.200]   So when he says Jesus went into the heavenly, he's talking about this.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:57.000]   That is to say, not to this creation, not through the blood of goats and calves,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.800]   but through his own blood, he entered the holy place once for all,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.040]   having attained eternal redemption.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   So in other words, he didn't go in there and sprinkle the goat's blood or the
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.640]   bull's blood.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:13.200]   He says, "By his own blood, the most powerful life-giving blood,
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.640]   he sprinkled it in the heavenly places for the blood of goats and bulls and ashes
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.200]   of hypher, sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctified for cleansing
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:22.840]   of the flesh.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.080]   How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.040]   himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.840]   the living God?"
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.960]   Why did Jesus have to be perfect?
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.840]   Because the sacrifice had to be perfect.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.000]   Everything that he embedded into the nation of Israel.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.800]   For this reason, he's the mediae of a new covenant so that since a death has taken
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.040]   place for the redemption of the transgression that were committed under the
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.400]   of eternal inheritance.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.920]   I'm not going to go and dissect this passage because we're going to get to
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.480]   chapter 9 eventually, right?
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.240]   Give me about eight more months.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.880]   We'll probably be there, right?
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.960]   And we'll dive into this.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.520]   But today, the point of this is to just kind of point to you that this is what he's
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.320]   talking about in verse 14, that we are able to hold fast because of what Jesus
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.600]   has done.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.280]   Okay?
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:24.280]   And let me go a little bit further of what this seat, this mercy seat represents.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.760]   In Exodus 25, 21 through 22, God says, "You shall put the mercy seat on top
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.320]   of the ark, and in the ark, you shall put the testimony which I will give to you.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.120]   There, I will meet with you."
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.840]   Did you get that?
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.200]   "And from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.280]   ark of the testimony, I will speak to you about all that I will give you in the
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.000]   commandment for the sons of Israel."
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.600]   In other words, the mercy seat, right?
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   The Holy of Holies was considered God's inner chamber.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:04.120]   The ark of the covenant was his footstool, and the mercy seat on top of that was
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.840]   where God was going to come and the high priest who represents Israel,
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.200]   that was their meeting place.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.000]   And God said, "I will speak to you there."
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.960]   And that's why he had to go and sprinkle the curtain and sprinkle the seats and
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:26.120]   sprinkle with blood to cover so that he would not die from encountering this God.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:30.720]   But here's where all of this comes together.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   Hebrews 10, 10 through 12, "By this will, we have been sanctified through the
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.040]   offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.680]   Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.320]   sacrifices.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:46.200]   We can never take away sins, but he, having offered one sacrifice for sins
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.680]   for all time, sat down at the right hand of God."
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.480]   Did you catch that?
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.880]   That mercy seat was his throne.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.840]   It was Jesus' throne.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.240]   He said, "All the priests came and they just did their work and they heard and
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.440]   then they would leave because that wasn't their place.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.920]   When Jesus came, sprinkled it with his blood, after all the sacrifices were made,
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:19.360]   the seat where God comes and man comes to connect with this holy God,
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.200]   that was his throne.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.040]   And he sits down forever.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.200]   In Hebrews 12, 2, again, it says, "Fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.520]   the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.160]   cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.200]   throne of God."
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.000]   The whole drama of the Day of Atonement, of the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:53.920]   of the priesthood, and of that mercy seat in particular was about Jesus.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.440]   And Jesus was sent by his own blood so that he can sit at that mercy seat so
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.640]   that mankind can come to Christ in his throne.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.080]   And that's where God speaks.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.200]   God speaks to us through his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.760]   And we speak to the Father through the Son.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.960]   That's why he says, "When we pray, to pray in what?
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.320]   Jesus' name."
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:23.400]   So no man can come to God until we come and bow down to his throne first.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.360]   He is the mediator.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.200]   He became the perfect mediator for eternity.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:34.640]   And that's why he says, "To hold on to your confession."
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.400]   And the reason why you are able to hold on to your confession is because Jesus has
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.800]   already paid the price.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.400]   He went into the inner chamber of God, sprinkled it with his blood,
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.640]   and then he sat down.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.240]   And then what does he say in the next passage?
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:53.240]   "Therefore, let us draw near to the throne of grace."
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.480]   That's the next passage.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:06.760]   The cross, the cross to an unbeliever is a fixture of torture, of suffering,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:12.440]   a burden, which ultimately leads to humiliation and death.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.000]   And you can't fake that.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.880]   If you're an unbeliever, as I said a few weeks ago, if Christ is not your rest,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.000]   he will eventually become your burden.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.720]   You cannot carry the burden of the cross unless you really know Christ.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.160]   You cannot.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.840]   You can fake it for a while.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.960]   You can jump through the hoops and play the church game for a while.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:43.080]   But only an individual whose eyes have been opened, this object of torture
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:51.280]   and suffering, and ultimately death became a place where we find life and joy.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:58.960]   And the distinction between the two is darkness and light, and you can't fake that.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:07.200]   Only a person whose eyes have been opened can come to the cross and find life.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.680]   In 1 Corinthians 1:18, it says, "For the word of cross is foolishness to those
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:18.560]   who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:23.480]   The pastor who walked away from his faith.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.080]   An individual can go that far in pretending.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.880]   An individual can go so far as to write commentaries and books and speak
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   nationally and have mega churches and have every church wanting to come and speak
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:45.560]   and become a mega superstar, and you can go that far and still fake it.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.840]   And his public confession is, "Now, I feel free."
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.960]   He felt bound.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.400]   Christ was a burden to him all these years.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.520]   And now he says, "I'm free.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.640]   Don't worry about me.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.880]   I'm going where I belong."
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.760]   That was his confession, if you guys read his confession.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:09.400]   But a child of God whose eyes have been opened, it will be a burden when you drift.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.960]   If you're a child of God and when you hear his voice, today if you hear his voice,
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.800]   do not harden your heart and you fear.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.720]   You fear that you've been drifting and you've been drifting away from where you
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.400]   find life.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.360]   Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart and it causes you
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.880]   to wake up.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.120]   It causes you to see that this is not where you are headed.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.200]   This is not who you are.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.320]   And then he says, "As a result of that, you are diligent."
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.080]   What do I need to do?
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.520]   What do I need to do?
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.360]   I need to carefully consider the way I'm having fellowship.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   I know there's a lot of Christian gatherings, but are you really having
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:44.880]   fellowship?
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.720]   When was the last time you guys got together and really prayed for each other,
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.120]   prayed for this lost world?
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:59.800]   Let us be diligent that we may not have found ourselves fall short.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.560]   And then if we are being diligent or if we're committed to being diligent,
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   he says to hold fast, to not to just loosely hold on to this confession.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.920]   Let it drift week to week.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.120]   And whether that happens instantaneously or whether it happens eventually in time,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.840]   not to wake up one day and realize that you never really had faith.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:25.240]   But to those who are being saved, it is the power of God.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.440]   In 2 Corinthians 2, 15 to 16, "For we are a fragrance of Christ to God
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.200]   among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.600]   to one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.840]   And who is adequate for these things?"
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.640]   You know, whenever we hear stories of persecution, and I'm sure you've been
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.000]   reading it as much as I have, persecution meter is not just in India,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.480]   in China, in the Middle East, North Korea, everywhere.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.600]   And even in the United States, there is this hostility growing
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.160]   around the world toward Christians.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:08.080]   We shouldn't be surprised by that because the Bible says, "To me,
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.480]   persecution is a precursor to revival."
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.800]   Because what persecution happens, what persecution does is it reveals
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.440]   genuine faith.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.320]   And those who do not have genuine faith will drift because if you want to stay
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.120]   safe, you have to stay in the middle ground.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.320]   You have to make some compromises.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.040]   You have to say certain things and do certain things so that you can fit in,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.120]   you don't stand out.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:36.440]   But those who have met Christ is not able to do that.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.160]   He is suffocated.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:41.920]   A genuine Christian is suffocated when he's not walking right with God.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:47.520]   And the hostility of the world will grow when the light becomes brighter.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.400]   So to me, the fact that persecution is rising around the world,
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.000]   it means the light is turning on brighter.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.200]   And God is distinguishing between those who are just going through the motion
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.160]   versus those who are truly saved.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:09.760]   My encouragement to us again as we, week after week, we're expositing this text,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.360]   if you want to drift, do nothing.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.920]   Do nothing.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.440]   Keep doing what you're doing.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.560]   Do what you did last Monday, do it again tomorrow.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.720]   What you did last Tuesday, do it again Tuesday.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.840]   What you did last month, do it again this month.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.040]   What you did last year, do it again.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.000]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.560]   Just hear the word of God and say, "I liked your message.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.920]   That was convicting, the end."
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.520]   And you will continue to drift, and you will continue to drift,
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.600]   continue to drift, and there will be no sense of urgency.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.800]   And one day, you're going to find that this was all fake.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   But that is not you.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:54.240]   If you've seen Jesus, if you really met Jesus, whether that was last year,
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:02.360]   yesterday, or 10 years ago, if you genuinely know this Jesus,
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.440]   nothing in our life, not even raising children, not even our retirement plan,
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:14.400]   not even getting ahead in life, nothing matters as much as this.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.480]   Because it affects your relationship with your children.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.840]   It affects what you do.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.880]   It affects your income.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.080]   It affects your retirement.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.480]   It affects your whole life.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:30.600]   If you are drifting and you understand what I am saying, today, today,
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.160]   not when your children are older, not when you have enough in the bank
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:38.040]   account, not when you got your job, not when things are settled, today,
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.120]   And I want to, again, encourage you with something practical.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.400]   Whenever we make applications, you know, like, we have a tendency to make
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.840]   really big applications of, like, I want to be a better Christian,
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.040]   or I want to sacrifice and do this, and I want my life to count,
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.120]   and all these things may be sincere, but it's not applicable, right?
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.000]   So it's just good intention with no application.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.040]   What I want to encourage you today is if you've been drifting,
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.240]   think of one thing that you really need to be diligent.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.640]   Think of one thing that you really need to be diligent in doing and ask God
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.320]   to help you to do that.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:33.000]   Take the step, take the actual step of being diligent and holding fast,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.320]   and to be reminded of who he is so that we may draw near.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:42.360]   So, again, as I ask the worship team to come back up, as I ask the worship team
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.720]   to come back up, and as they lead us in time of worship, I want to ask you,
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.800]   if you hear his voice, if you've been hearing his voice in the
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.440]   warning, he said, "Let us fear, let us be diligent, let us hold fast,
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:04.680]   let us draw near," what is one thing that you can do today to get back on track?
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.440]   What is one thing that you need to get rid of?
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.320]   What is one thing that you need to apply today?
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.000]   And begin to take the proper steps to get to the place where you need to go.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.440]   And so, come to the Lord in prayer.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.920]   And again, we can do this because God has already done it for us.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.400]   God's not saying, "Prove yourself so that I may open the door."
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.000]   He says, "No, the door has been opened.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.440]   You've been covered by the blood of Christ.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.520]   You're my adopted child.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.440]   Now live up to the calling that's been given to you."
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.120]   So, as we come before the Lord in prayer, let's make our prayers practical.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.760]   "Lord, this is something that I need to do.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.040]   I need to get rid of this and I need to do this.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.920]   Lord, give me help."
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.360]   Okay?
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.840]   So, let's take some time to pray again as our worship team leads us.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:55.840]   [SOUND]
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:04.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
