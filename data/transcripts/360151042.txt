[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   How do you distinguish between being childish and childlike?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I think we all know the distinction between being childish and childlike.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Childlike is somebody who's brand new, and you don't have to be a certain age to be childlike.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I think it's one of the most encouraging things that I see is when a young believer comes to faith,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   and they're just trying to figure out what is and isn't okay.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   So every once in a while we'll have somebody who's brand new to their faith,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   will be asking very fundamental questions.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Is it okay for me to sit here?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Can I go upstairs?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   People ask questions like that.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   What kind of Bible should I get?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   How should I pray?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And it's very childlike because they're beginning in their walk with God,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   and they're asking these questions because they're trying to figure out what does it mean to be a follower of Christ.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Childishness is when someone who should have matured beyond that,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and they're acting the same way that they've acted maybe 10, 15 years ago,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and nothing has changed.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And so they're not acting their age.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   That's what we call childishness.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Childlikeness is cute.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Childishness is annoying.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   You know, years back when my knees were better,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I tried to go to LA Fitness and work out and play basketball,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and I remember about 10 years ago,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I started going because my knees started feeling better.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And so I started going, and every morning from Monday through Friday,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   there would be a group of guys probably about my age,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and they're all businessmen, so they didn't have a 95 job,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   so they were able to hang out for about an hour or two,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and we started playing basketball.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Initially, it was awkward when they found out that I was a pastor,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and so we always go through that awkward stage like, you know,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   am I going to get judged if I say something wrong?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And so we passed that period, and we spent enough time together where we literally started to become friends.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And so we started joking around with one another,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   and they started feeling comfortable enough with me where they just started being themselves.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   But one of the things that I noticed was, one, these guys are all athletic,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   so it was clear that they were jocks when they were younger,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and you could tell on the basketball court they were pretty athletic even at that age.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   But another thing that I saw was they were living their glory days on the basketball court,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and so we couldn't play basketball for more than 15 minutes straight
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   because every time a young pretty girl would walk upstairs,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   they would sit there and gawk at that girl and talking about, you know,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   like when they were younger, they used to do this and they used to do that.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And again, I felt comfortable enough to just mock them.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You know, none of those girls are interested in you.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   You know, you're wasting your time.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   You don't know yourself.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And so I would have to kind of bring them back, and we would play basketball for a while,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and every 15 minutes, they would go back.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And I realized that these guys were all big men on campus when they were younger.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   They were the athletic jocks, maybe the quarterback of their team,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and they were living their glory days, you know, and they were on the court,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and every chance that they got, they would talk about, you know, how they played basketball
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   or how they played football when they were younger and how they used to date so many girls.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And, you know, again, it's annoying, right?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   That's what I mean by childishness, that they should have matured beyond that by now,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   but they're always looking back and saying, "Man, when I was younger, when I was in high school,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   when I was in college."
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The sad thing is many Christians know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   When we talk about our spiritual maturity, it always goes back to, "Man, when I was in college,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   you know, when I used to be a part of this campus meeting, when I used to lead this,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   when I used to do that," and always looking back because those were the glory days.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   But then ever since we left college, there was no growth,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   and you're exactly where you were when you graduated, whether it was five years ago, ten years ago,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   or twenty years ago, so whenever we talk about spiritual maturity, you always think about, like,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   the glory days back then, when I used to do this, when I used to do that.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Imagine, imagine if the rest of your life, not just your spiritual part,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   but your understanding of finances, how you talked, what you valued, what you wore, how you behaved.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   If you didn't mature any of that after you graduated college, what kind of adult would you be?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Probably very childish, right? At least from an adult's perspective.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   See, the author of Hebrews has been writing to the recipients because they would not move beyond
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   their fundamentals, and he's been warning them to not to drift, and continue to drift,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and then miss, and possibly become apostate because of it.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   See, what happens in our walk with God is we begin to think, if we're not careful,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   and it is a reflection of our theology, to think that once we're justified,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   we have a free ticket to get to heaven, so it's good if we mature.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   If we're disciplined, and if we're serious about our faith, which some people are in the church,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   but we're perfectly fine just being where we were 10, 15, 20 years ago because we're justified.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And so all we are looking for and hearing for constantly when we come to church
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   is reaffirmation over and over and over of, "You're fine. Don't worry about it.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Things are good. One saved, always saved."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And we perk up when we hear those things because it justifies where we are.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   But the author of Hebrews is challenging them to move forward, to press on.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Apostle Paul, as he is sitting in prison in Philippians 3, 12-14,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   this is a man who is possibly facing the death penalty.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And he's sitting there in prison, writing to the church outside.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   He says, "Now that I have already, not that I already obtained it or have already become perfect,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus."
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   He says he's not living as if he's already made it.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   He says, "Because I haven't achieved it yet," he says, "I press on."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Verse 13, "Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I press on toward the goal for which the prize of upward call of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   He's sitting in prison. He's at the tail end of his ministry, possibly about to die,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and he says, "I'm pressing on. I'm straining toward the goal."
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Even the apostle, to the day that he dies, was straining toward God.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The problem that we have in our generation with our Christianity is the moment we are justified,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   we act and live as if we've already arrived.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And we're here. And the striving stops.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And the pressing on is something that we remember from the past.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And we just kind of coast.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   You know what's interesting here in chapter 6, verse 1, when he says,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   "Therefore, leaving the elementary teachings about the Christ, let us press on."
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   The word "press on" here is different than the word Paul uses in Philippians chapter 3.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   The word in Philippians chapter 3, "to press on," basically just means to reach forward.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That's all that means. To go ahead.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   But the word for "press on" here is a lot more nuanced than that word.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   The word has the idea of bearing up under pressure.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So when he says, "to press on," what he means by that is not simply to go forward,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   but to continue forward under the pressure.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And the reason why he uses that word is because of the context of the recipients of the letter.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   They were beginning to drift because of the pressure.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   They've been Christians for a while now.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Not 50, 60 years, possibly 10 to 15 to 20 years, which many of us in this room probably have been.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   They've been under the pressure.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   The Bible describes in chapter 10 that they were gung-ho Christians at one point.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   They were people who had their possessions confiscated.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   They had friends who were dragged into prison.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And at that time, in the beginning, they were celebrating with them, and they were growing and being challenged.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   But after about 10, 15, 20 years have passed, the pressure began to get to them.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And instead of persevering and straining toward, they began to settle.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And as a result of that, they started to drift.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   When we understand our salvation as simply a past tense, and it just happened.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I've been baptized. I'm justified.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So therefore, the rest of my life, I could coast.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It'd be good if I strained, but I could coast, and I'm still safe.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Well, the Bible describes our salvation as past, present, and future.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   In 1 Corinthians 1.18, it says, "For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing," present tense,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   "but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It says it again in 2 Corinthians 2.15,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   "For we are a fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved, and among those who are perishing."
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Now, the theologians have identified three parts of our salvation,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   justification, sanctification, and glorification.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   But the mistake that we make is to think that these are three separate parts of our salvation.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   They're not.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Justification, sanctification, and glorification is a description of the same salvation.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   You cannot have justification without sanctification.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   You will not have glorification without sanctification or justification.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   It is just three different ways to describe how the Bible describes salvation.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It is used in past, present, and future.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   So, when Paul says, "For those who are being saved,"
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   we are not just being saved from going to hell.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   We are being saved from an empty way of life.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   We are being saved from being under the judgment of sin.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   We're being saved from death.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So, it is not simply, "Oh, I got saved from, and so when I die, I'm not going to go to hell."
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Or a whole way of life.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   The Bible says the God of this age is who? Satan.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So, we are being saved from the control and the power that sin has on mankind.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So, this desire to be somebody, this pursuit of fame and recognition, of finances,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   all of this is under the umbrella of satanic power.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   So, when we are justified, we are freed.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   But our sanctification is the process of freeing us from that bondage.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So, that's why when Apostle Paul says that, "I haven't obtained it,"
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   he's not saying that he's not saved.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   He's not saying this process of salvation, being freed from the bondage and influence of sin,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   he hasn't gone to completion yet.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And that's why he says, "I am pressing on, and I am straining toward the goal."
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I think the best way for us to understand that is,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   if somebody is drowning in a storm in the middle of the ocean,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and pretty much, I mean, there's no hope for you,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and all of a sudden, a boat comes, right?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   The coast guard comes, and he pulls you out of the water,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   and now you're not in the water, but you're in the boat, but you're not safe yet.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Because you're still in the storm.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   But you're in the lifeboat that is in the process of saving you.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   So, you can say that you are saved, but you are being saved.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Because you're in the boat, justification, and sanctification is taking you to shore, to safety.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   And that's how the Bible describes our salvation.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So, when we only see our salvation as justification,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   we don't have a complete picture of how the Bible describes salvation.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And that's exactly what he's trying to say.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   What he's trying to tell us is, if you hold on to a decision that was made,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   or an experience that you had in the past,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   you do not understand the full gamut of our salvation.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   He says, "Before we cling to Christ,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   we must leave behind the elementary teachings about the Christ."
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   The word for "leave," aphiemi, isn't simply to leave as in like,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   "You know, I was in one place, and now I'm going to leave to somewhere else."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Aphiemi has the idea of forsaking, to put away, to disregard, to put off.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   This word aphiemi is akin to the same idea in Genesis chapter 2, 24.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   When two people get married, we say, "You must leave and cleave."
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Yesterday, it seems like there was more than five or six different weddings.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   At least, that's what it seemed like on Facebook.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   It seemed like half the church was at somebody's wedding yesterday.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Every time you have a wedding, usually in a traditional Christian wedding,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   you have the candle lighting ceremony.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   In that ceremony, in the middle of the service,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   the bride and the groom will come,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   and they will take the two lights representing each family,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and they would light one candle, and they would blow out the other two,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   symbolizing that they are leaving and cleaving to each other.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   That's the idea when he says, "Let us leave behind the elementary teachings of the Christ."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   In order for us to press on toward Christ, there must be a moving forward.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And that was the problem with this church,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   that they were clinging on to these things,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   these six foundational things that he mentions here in the next verse.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And because they wouldn't leave it behind,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   they could not move forward to cling to Christ.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   The reason why they were not anchored to Christ
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   is because they were anchored to their old life.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   They weren't just willy-nilly. They weren't anchored to nothing.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   What they were anchored to wouldn't allow them to come to Christ.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   And that's why he's saying, "Your drifting is because you will not grow up."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And that's why he calls them infants in the previous passage,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   that you are acting like a child.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   You're being childish, where by now you should have been teachers.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   You had the instructions given to you.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   You were exposed to everything that everyone else was exposed to,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   and yet you are not moving on.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   The six things that he mentions here, he says they are foundations or elementary principles.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And that's exactly how the Bible describes the Old Covenant.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Foundational.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Anybody who's ever done any kind of building, or you know anything about building,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   you know that you have to build a foundation before you build it up.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Or else it's shaky. You're building on sand.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And based upon how big the building this is going to be,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   you know how deep the foundation is going to be.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So if you're just building a one-story, you know, one-story maybe shack outside,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   it may be no more than two to three feet deep.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   But if you have a two-story house, it may go deeper than that.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   If you're building a skyscraper, the foundation alone
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   will maybe be three or four feet deep, four stories deep.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And so you know by the foundation what is being built on the top.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Well, the whole Old Covenant was foundation building.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And it was deep. It was thousands of years of foundation building
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   so that when Christ came, they could build.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   And so what he's saying is, God has laid this foundation,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   but this foundation is not to build the foundation.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   The foundation is to build toward Christ.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And that's what he is saying.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   We need to get to Melchizedek.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   We need to begin to build so that we can see a clearer picture of who he is.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   But you will not move beyond the foundation.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   There's a book by James Dobson on how to raise strong-willed children.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   So if some of you have strong-willed children, you should go read that book.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Basically in that book, he has a story of this one child.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   He refused to eat solids.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   He was already five years old and never ate solids.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He would only drink milk.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   So early on, obviously, oh, he drinks milk well.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   But after he turns one, it's like, okay, he should be eating solids by now.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Two years pass by, he's like, is this okay?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   A third year goes by, this can't be right.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Fourth year, they're fighting with him, and they keep losing because they're afraid he's going to starve to death.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   So by the time they get to the fifth year, they decided we need to take him to the doctor
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   because there's no way he's going to be able to survive on milk alone.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   So he tells a story about how he takes him to the hospital and tells the story,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and the doctor says, oh, he won't eat solids.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   He's like, yeah, I mean, I try to feed him, but he refuses,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   and I'm afraid that if we don't give him milk, he's going to starve to death.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And so the doctor said, okay, I have an idea.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And so he said, get all the IVs and all this ready,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   and basically tells the child, if you don't eat solids, you're not getting anything.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And if we feel like he's going to starve to death, we'll give him IVs, so don't worry about it.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   He's not going to die, but he's not going to drink milk.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   So he tells a story about how he sat there, and just within a few hours,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   something that he would not eat for five years, all of a sudden he started chewing.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   So he was fine all this time.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   It was just the parents were just kind of like so afraid that he's going to starve to death,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   and this child knew this, and he was taking advantage of that.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   That's what the author is saying. It's time for us to move on.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It's time for us to move on into maturity.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And maturity isn't simply just, hey, let's just do some hard things.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   He says, let's move on to maturity so that we can understand the deep things of Christ.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And he's going to do that when we get to chapter 7 and on.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   But before he does that, he tells them, this is why some of you are going to be lost.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Now, what he is trying to do, we need to be very, very careful,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   because if we see Christ as simply the vehicle and not the destination,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   it is enough when we only have a little of Christ, as long as it fulfills what I desire,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   as long as I am healthy, as long as I am eating, as long as there's no crisis in my life, that's enough.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   But that's not how the Bible describes our relationship with Christ.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Our whole purpose of our salvation is to get to Christ. He is our destination.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   That's why Jesus doesn't say, I give life. He says, I am the life.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   He doesn't just say, I show you the way. He says, I am the way.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   He doesn't just talk about him talking the truth. He says, I am the truth.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And those are the all seven "I am" statements in the book of John, trying to remind the nation of Israel,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   you want me to give you food, but I am the bread.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   You ask for water, but I am the living water.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   The reason why people are satisfied with a minimum amount of Christ
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   is because they only see him as the vehicle and not the destination.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And that's exactly what Paul is trying to say, that we need to go all the way to Christ.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Not simply to make a decision and say, you know what, now I know Christ because I raise my hand and I do some things.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   But they would not move beyond the fundamentals.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   It was a shadow. The old covenant was given as a shadow to point to Christ,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   but they kept on focusing on the shadow.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Why did they do that? What was the motivation behind it? And why did they remain as infants?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Well, Donald Hagner, who writes a commentary on the book of Hebrews, and I think he says it well.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   He says, it is striking that six items that are mentioned here all find parallel in Judaism.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   This may suggest that the readers were attempting somehow to remain with Judaism
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   by emphasizing items that are in common between Judaism and Christianity.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   They may have been trying to survive with a minimal Christianity
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   in order to avoid alienating their Jewish friends and relatives.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Those six things that are mentioned are common Old Testament turf
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   where they could have camped most comfortably without having to make a stand.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Did you get that?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   He said the whole reason why they would not move beyond that is because
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   the pressure that they were getting from the Jewish community, their family and friends,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   their cousins, their relatives, maybe their parents.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   They were trying to figure out how can they remain friendly with the Jewish community and still be a Christian.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   So everything that is mentioned here, these six different items, are Old Testament covenant.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   That does not necessarily contradict Christianity, but only a foundation to point them toward Christ.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   So as long as they held on to some of this, and then held on to the minimum of Christ,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   they were thinking that they can stay in this middle ground.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   When the scripture makes it absolutely crystal clear,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   when it says if you want to come after me, let him deny himself and pick up his cross.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   This is their way of following Christ without the cross.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   This is their way of retaining their life while they are proclaiming that they are followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And so on the surface, they are doing what they were supposed to do.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   They are coming to church, they are doing all of this stuff, but they never fully understand Christ.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Their affection for Christ never grows.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And so they are always looking back in their glory days, when they had nothing to lose back in college or in high school.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   But they are always caving under the pressure.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And so they have become spiritual infants.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   That's what he was challenging them to move beyond.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The sixth thing, I'm not going to go into detail of these things because all of it represents the Old Covenant.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   He says, "A repentance from dead works."
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   The reason why the Jewish community, the Judaizers, couldn't let go of this is because their confidence came from obeying the law.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And so they weren't willing to let that go.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Because they worked so hard to build up their status, their spiritual status.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And Christ comes and says, "All of that leads to greater condemnation."
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   But to let go of that means everything that they built up.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Like, "I've got to forsake all of that and start over."
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Imagine if Apostle Paul, he was at the top.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   This is where all the Jews wanted to go.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   He was possibly sitting as a senator of Israel among the Jews.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   His disciple was the top scholar of that time.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   He's a Roman citizen.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So any Jew would look at Apostle Paul and say, "That's what I want."
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   He already had what everybody wanted.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And yet Paul says, "In light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ, all of that became rubbish."
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   There's a reason why the Judaizers couldn't let that go, because that was part of their status.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   He says, "It's time for us to move beyond repentance from dead works, from faith toward God."
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I'm like, "Faith toward God? Move beyond faith toward God?"
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Well, obviously he's not talking about our genuine faith that leads us to Christ.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   He's talking about this superficial faith of the old covenant, of faith in their own works,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   faith in the washings, to move beyond that.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   What seems to be real, in the end, is not.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   I found this song, and I don't know if it's a country song.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Basically, it's a song about getting over a breakup.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And I thought it was interesting because the title of the song is "Just Enough Jesus."
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   "Yeah, the little you left me, it won't get me far, cure my condition or unbreak my heart.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But I can get through the night, and that's all that I need.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Heck, I'm doing just fine here in good company.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Because I've got just enough to Jones to drive me to drinking,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   just enough whiskey to keep me from thinking.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I got to the bottom, I got to the truth, I found just enough Jesus to get over you.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Yeah, I got to the bottom, I got to the truth, oh, I found just enough Jesus to get over you."
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   The danger of apostasy, you don't just wake up one day just on fire for God and say,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   "You know what? I don't believe this anymore."
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   It's slowly, gradually just succumbing to the pressure, and it begins to erode our faith.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And we hold on to the minimum that we need to say that we are Christian.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   What is the minimum doctrine that I need to profess?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   What is the minimum that I need to do?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And we hold on to this superficial understanding, superficial affections for Christ
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   without having to feel like I've abandoned my faith,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   not realizing that those are the foundations that lead to apostasy.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I remember years ago, I used to go to this church, and I have a friend who was a youth pastor.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Again, this is many, many years ago.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And he would ask me to come and speak at their retreat every summer.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And the same group of kids, about 30 of them, high school students.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And at the end of the retreat, the youth pastor would always ask me, "Can you give an altar call?"
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And so, you know, we don't do altar calls at our church, but they practice it,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   and so I said, "Okay, I'll do that," and I would give an altar call.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And I remember the first year I was there, half of the students came up, and we were so related.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   They became a Christian. We would pray for them, and I would be encouraged.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Next year I would come, and I would give the message,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   and after that, on the last day, he'd ask me to give an altar call, and they would come.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Initially, I was like, "Oh, wow, they're coming to Christ."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And then I'd look at their faces, like, "It's the same guys from last year."
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Right? So what's going on at this church?
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   So I would leave, and then I said, "Hmm, okay, that's great."
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   They recommitted their lives to Christ.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Third year I would come, and then third year I would see the same students, and give an altar call.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   The same kids come up on the third year, and clearly something's going wrong.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   So after that, I talked to the youth pastor, "What's going on?"
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   He said, "Every year they would make a commitment, and a couple weeks into it,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   they would begin to fall out, and they would begin to backslide.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   And so every year, when they come back to the retreat, they would go over this routine over and over again."
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And in the fourth year I went, same thing.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I gave an altar call, same kids, exact same kids were coming up.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And it just happened, after that, the youth pastor got tired of it.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And he's like, "Don't come up. Don't come up.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   You don't come up. You don't come up. And you don't come up."
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And then after this, took us to the Harvest Crusade.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And so we were all there together.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   So I took our youth group kids, and he brought his youth group kids,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and Greg Laurie gave an invitation, and the same kids got up.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And my friend stood up, turned around, and was like, "Don't move. Don't move.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Don't go down."
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And I remember how comical that scene was, because everybody around was watching what he was doing.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   They said, "What is that man doing? They want Jesus, but he's not letting them."
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And they're like, "Pastor, we want to go down."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   I was like, "No!"
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Because they would not move beyond.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And the reason why is because they would make profession,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   but as soon as they would make profession, that's it.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   There was no follow. They would not move beyond maturity.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   So every year, over and over again, they would repeat the same cycle.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Because of their superficial faith, superficial understanding, and superficial commitment.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   He said, "Let us move on to instructions about washings."
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Some of your translation says "baptism," but the correct translation is "washing,"
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   because it is in the plural, and it is clearly not referring to baptism.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   He's talking about the Jewish washings.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And the reason why they were clinging to this is because washing was what they did to feel clean.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   So as long as they washed, as long as they went through this ritual cleansing, they felt clean.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Ezekiel 36-25 says, "When the new covenant comes, when the Messiah comes,"
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   He said, "then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols."
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Again, in Titus 3-5, "He saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit."
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Constantly laying the foundation of this instructions about washing is no different than somebody who commits a heinous sin,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   and in order to deal with his guilt, he takes a long shower.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And he's trying to scrub that guilt off of him and use soap.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And he said, "And nothing has changed."
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   So he turns on the bath water.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   And he says, "I soak myself."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And you're in the bath water, and you're trying to cleanse this guilt off,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   but no matter how long you stay in the water, it never comes off.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Because that sin is not something you can wash off from external cleansing.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And again, we don't struggle with that, but we struggle with the same concept.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Whenever we have communion, there's always somebody who says, "I'm not worthy because I struggled with purity this week.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   I didn't do my quiet time. I didn't memorize verses."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   So suddenly, we convince ourselves that I need to earn my way into the presence of God.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And the whole purpose of the communion is to remind us that the only way to God is by His blood.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And to come to the communion table to deserve it is the exact opposite of what the communion table represents.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   You cannot wash yourself of your sin.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Only by faith and repentance and receiving the blood of Christ can we be cleansed.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And so that's why he's saying, "Let us move beyond this self-righteousness
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   to trying to pay off our sins here by being good here."
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   He says, "Let us move beyond this elementary understanding and of laying of hands."
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Resurrection from the dead, eternal judgment.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Now I'm going to move beyond for the sake of this time, but this eternal judgment in 1 John 4, 18.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   He's talking about the law brought a warning that if you break the law, you shall surely die.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And the old covenant was meant to bring fear.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   The old covenant was to teach them that a holy God cannot be approached by sinful men.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   These people were constantly living under this fear because they never moved beyond that.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   But the point of that was to find relief in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But because they never went fully to Christ, they're constantly living in fear of judgment.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   In 1 John 4, 18, it says, "There is no fear in love.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   But perfect love casts out fear because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love."
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Romans 8, 1.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   "Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Now don't get me wrong.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   The Bible is not saying that if you are justified, no matter how you live,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   no matter what you do, it doesn't matter.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   The whole sermon was about how we need to understand our salvation holistically.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Justification, sanctification, and glorification.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   But when he's talking about fear, he's talking about an individual who is striving after God, but he's not perfect.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And he keeps stumbling.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   He keeps struggling, just like Peter, just like all the disciples.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   That no matter how strongly intended, no matter how strong-willed they were, they could not.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   He said, "Your spirit is willing, but your flesh is weak."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   He's not talking about an individual who is superficially saying, "Oh, I believe in Jesus, and I can do whatever I want."
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   He's not talking about that.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   He's talking about an individual who is striving, yet he does not move beyond the fundamentals,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   that we have been freed, that our assurance of salvation is secure.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Let us move beyond the foundation and the shadow, and to come all the way to Christ.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Not to simply see him as a vehicle, but the destination itself.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And that's what he means.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   I want to get to Melchizedek, because Melchizedek is going to explain to us that Jesus' unique role as the king priest.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   But before he gets there, he's like, "You need to pay attention, and if the Lord is willing, we will do so."
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And at some point, we are going to get to chapter 7.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   We're going to be here a few more weeks.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   But in the end, this is all preparation for what's coming.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Remember why they were drifting.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   They were drifting because of the pressure.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   They were great.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   When Paul wrote the prison epistle to Philippians, there was great joy.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   In fact, it says, "Because of his imprisonment, many of the brothers were preaching the gospel with more boldness."
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   But by the time he writes 2 Timothy, the pressure has gone to a lot of people.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Even his close companions were beginning to abandon their faith and go back home.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And so this pressure wasn't just affecting the recipients of Hebrews, but the whole Christendom.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   The first 10 years, it was great, but after 20, after 30 years,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and then they began to see every one of their leaders, one by one, being plucked and literally being crucified and beheaded,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   people began to ask, "Well, all the glory and all this shine and honor,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   whatever it was that they were seeking, began to fade.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   And the hardship and the reality of following Christ and picking up the cross began to sink in, just like many of us.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   You know, this idealistic view of Christianity when you first came to faith has faded for many of us.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   I'm going to turn this world upside down for Jesus.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It's faded for many of us.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   We have a hard time even controlling our own thoughts.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Let alone turning the world upside down for Jesus Christ, we can't even turn our own selves.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Can't control our own flesh.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   So this idealistic view of what we're going to be for the kingdom of God has faded.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And as a result of that, we've just given up.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Not realizing that idealism, much of that was our flesh.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Christ came because we could not.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   He gave us eternal life because we couldn't earn it.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   We couldn't scrub hard enough to get the sin off.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And that's why Christ came.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And that's why salvation is free.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And that's why he says to come.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   We don't enter the throne of grace with confidence because of our ability.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   It's because of what he has done.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   You know, years back, years back, back in the '80s, there was this fear going around the United States
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and probably around the world that if the trend continued, Christianity was not going to exist in the next 50 years.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And so some of you, a few of you may remember, a few of you may remember back then,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   but back at that time, there was a mass exodus.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   And the mass exodus were those people who were in their 40s and 50s now.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And it says somewhere around 85% of the young adults after they graduated college were dropping out of church.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And this was not unique to any particular denomination.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   The Southern Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, they were all showing these numbers.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And they were saying that if this trend continues, we're going to be exactly where Europe is.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Hyper-liberal, empty churches, large grand buildings, but empty, which is where they are now.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   But all of a sudden, we start hearing these stories about something happening in Willow Creek in Chicago.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And there's this one particular church that's actually, you know, like he's reversing the trend.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And all these thousands, tens of thousands of young people are coming to church.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Some of you guys know who I'm talking about.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   A man named Bill Hybels wrote a book called "Rediscovering the Church."
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And I remember reading that book, and in that book, he describes how his church started and what his philosophy was.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   He was a junior high school pastor of a group of maybe about 100 students.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And he had a staff of maybe about eight that he worked with.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And so he decided that he was going to do a different kind of ministry.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Instead of preaching, that he's going to do skits.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And instead of just singing, so the whole thing is going to be interactive.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Just like you would run VBS with younger children.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   He said, "Why not do it with the junior high school kids?"
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And it was wildly successful. He went from maybe 70, 80 students to hundreds.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And at one point, he said he had over 800 junior high school students coming.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And it was wildly successful.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   And in the peak of that success, he thought to himself, "Why can't we do this for the adults?"
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   So he took that same staff that he had, and he decided to plant the church to do the same thing.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   People who are being bored and they're tired and they're leaving the church, the young adults.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   What can we do to grab them so that they can stay at church?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   So they started doing the exact same thing that they learned from VBS,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   that they applied to junior high school, and they started doing it with the adults.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And it was wildly successful.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Tens of thousands of people started coming to church.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   By the time he wrote that book, it was a mega church already.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Not only his church, because he was the one bucking the trend.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   It became nationally famous, and internationally, they began to apply the same method.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Why don't we take all the fuddy-duddy stuff that's not nailed down in Scripture,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   and make it as palatable as possible to as many people as possible, so that they can come?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And so after about 30 plus years of that, now that you don't hear the term "seeker-friendly" anymore,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   whether it's market-driven or whatever names that it has changed, but the idea is the same.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   How do we get people who are not interested in Christ to be interested in the church?
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   And that's where the downfall of the church is, if you're not careful.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   If you're not interested in Christ, you should not be interested in the church,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   because this is the body of Christ.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   The whole purpose of why you and I are gathered together is not to fill this room with as many people as possible.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   You know how large Jesus' disciples would have been if he stopped rebuking them?
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   If he stopped drawing lines?
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   If he stopped saying, "You're not coming to me because you want me, you want the bread that I gave you."
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And he started drawing lines.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   You know how large that crowd would have been.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   I mean, even with him rebuking, there were thousands of him everywhere he went.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   He would have had hundreds of them, maybe millions of people. Why not?
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   But what he wanted wasn't a multitude. He wanted disciples.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   And that's why he told his disciples before he left, "Go therefore, make disciples of all the nations,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   baptizing them, and then with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Not some, not most, but all that I have commanded you.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   So the call of the church is not simply to gather people.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   The call of the church is to proclaim Christ and bring people to maturity.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   If we've been living our lives looking at our glory days,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   how I was back then when I was younger,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   it's time for us to move on.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   It's time for us to commit to maturity.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   To not be infants, not be satisfied for where we were.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   I pray that Psalm 63 would be our prayer.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   "O God, you are my God, I shall seek you earnestly.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   My soul thirsts for you, my flesh yearns for you,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   in a dry and weary land where there is no water."
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   I pray that that would be our prayers today.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Let me examine our hearts. What are you thirsting for?
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Let's be honest with ourselves.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   What are you thirsty for? What are you hungry for?
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   If you do not come all the way to Christ,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   you will never know what Jesus meant when he said,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   "I have come to give life and to give this life abundantly."
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   If all you are doing is tasting him and then moving to the world,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   those are the foundations that lead to apostasy.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   So as the author of Hebrews is challenging us, let's move on.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Let's move on to maturity. Let's begin to dig the deep things of Christ
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   so that as we continue to gaze upon the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   that our life may be a reasonable response to him.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Let's pray.
