[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   Okay, let me pray for us and we'll jump right in. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.320]   blessing that we have. We pray, Father, that the study of your Word would open our eyes,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.120]   help us to have a deeper understanding of your grace in our lives, and that we may be
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.480]   affected and that we may apply all that you have given us. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.120]   Alright, so if you look at your first sheet, and just like I did last week, I'm going to
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.600]   start out with a principle of hermeneutics. One of the things that, again, I want to emphasize
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.280]   each week. And then the rest of it is for you to fill out as we go through the passage.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.840]   So again, if you want to make notes, the Bible verses are written down for you on the next
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.080]   page. And I'm hoping that you'll take notes here. And then the more organized notes on
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.040]   this one. Okay, so on this one it'll kind of give you an outline and I just left it
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.560]   blank. So what I write down on this, you may want to write down on this because this is
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.440]   something that you'll probably hold on to. But I also gave you this because I want you
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.120]   to see where we're getting at. I don't want you to just say, you know, look at verse two
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.800]   and three and then I just write it down. So I want you to see where we're getting at.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.920]   Again, the goal of this study is not for me to just tell you what it means. It's for you
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.600]   to go and get in the habit of studying the Bible for yourself. Okay. All right, so if
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   you look at the first page, the first principle that we want to look at, Scripture must interpret
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.840]   Scripture. God does not contradict himself. Though the Bible was written in the span of
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.000]   1500 years through 45 different human authors, the true author was God through the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.880]   Therefore we must interpret each letter in light of the context of the whole of Scripture.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.800]   So basically what it means is God is not going to say something that he said otherwise in
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.760]   another text. So if you're interpreting a passage and it contradicts something that
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.400]   was already stated in Scripture, most likely your interpretation is not correct. Right?
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.680]   It's just like, again, this is not unique to the Bible. This is, if you're having a
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.440]   conversation and you know, in the same conversation, if he said, I love apples, I hate apples,
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.160]   you know, then you say, okay, I must've heard something wrong or he meant, he must've meant
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.400]   hated apples in some other context. Right? So in Scripture, we have to understand that
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.680]   the author is the Holy Spirit. He used the agents of human beings, but ultimate author
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.200]   author is one person, the Holy Spirit. Right? And so therefore what he says in another text
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.680]   is not going to contradict what he says in, let's say, you know, in Hebrews, he's not
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.720]   going to contradict what he says in James or in Galatians. So that's what it means by
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.180]   allowing Scripture to interpret Scripture. One of the reasons why I always quote cross
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.860]   references, whether it's my preaching or in Bible study, is because, is for that reason.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.600]   So you can see that the interpretation of that passage is consistent with rest of Scripture.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.360]   So you're not just seeing, it's like, well, this is what it says. And we're just pulling
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.600]   meaning out of that, that you need to be in the habit of, if this is what it means, he
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.860]   must've said it somewhere else. In fact, oftentimes looking at other passages will help you to
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.080]   understand what he's saying here, because it's in the larger context of what he means.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.940]   You understand what I'm saying? Okay. So how this is applied in this particular text is
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.120]   in verse 24. So if you look at verse 24, it says, now I rejoice in the suffering for my
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   sake and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of his body, which is the church, in filling
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.440]   up what is lacking in Christ's affliction. So if you looked at that outside of any other
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.400]   context and just looked at that verse alone, what could you say of this? Which would be
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.480]   outright heresy. Apostle Paul is contributing to our atonement. Yes? Okay, you guys are
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.880]   all looking at me like you have no idea what I'm talking about. Verse 24, right? If you
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.720]   were to interpret that, if you're not paying attention, you look at that verse and you
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.560]   say, well, clearly scripture said, you're quoting the passage, right? There's a verse,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.360]   there's a line where Paul says, I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's affliction.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.720]   So there's a part of what Jesus did on the cross wasn't complete. So therefore Paul is
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.720]   fulfilling a necessary part of the atonement. Is that what Paul means? Clearly that's not
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.840]   what Paul means. Because Paul says clearly in other passages that that is not the case.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.160]   So that's what it means by allowing scripture to interpret scripture. If you have detailed
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.840]   conversation with cults, this is where they go wrong. So as a young Christian, if you
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.920]   talk to a Jehovah Witness, they'll quote verses and they'll tell you, well, clearly Jesus
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.020]   said this and they said this and Jesus is a God, not the God. And they'll have plenty
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.100]   of verses to back it up. Right? But they're taking it out of context. And that's where
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.500]   bad doctrine comes from. So if this is cannot mean what it could because it clearly contradicts
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.640]   rest of scripture. There's a few verses I want you to look up. John chapter 14 verse
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:35.640]   4 and John chapter 536. So if I can have somebody read out loud John chapter 17 verse 4, one
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.040]   of the guys tables can read that. And then John 536, one of the ladies tables can read
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.560]   that. Okay. And I'm just going to point to somebody. Isaac usually my go to guy here.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   So he's pretty quick looking at passages. John 17, 4, if you can look at it real quick.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:14.480]   17, 4. Does it look wrong? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that is the verse. Okay. And then denies John
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:33.360]   536 over there. Okay. Okay. I could have obviously picked, you know, tons of and dozens of other
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.440]   passages to refer to his atonement being uniquely Jesus's fulfilled work. When Jesus was crucified
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.360]   on the cross, he says it is finished. And again, you know, I'm not going to go into
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.420]   that doctrine here, but clearly the New Testament teaches that Christ's work on the cross is
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.120]   final and complete. There's nothing lacking. So what does Paul mean here when he says what
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.480]   is lacking in his affliction? So if you can look with me to Philippians chapter 230, we
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.560]   get an example, at least language wise, because it's the same author writing Colossians writing
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:14.160]   Philippians chapter 230. If I can have a one of the guys read that. Johnny Wang, if you
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:30.440]   can read Philippians 230 for me. And then Samantha, if you can read Romans 10, 14. Okay.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.040]   So Paul uses, again, he's not talking about Christ's atonement, but he uses a very similar
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:42.400]   language talking about how he was completing what was lacking in his service. So again,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.000]   the language is the same. He's saying that something that Paul was doing that he needed
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.560]   help in, and he talks about that in the context of, again, lacking. Romans chapter 10, 14,
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:07.800]   and I think you guys know that passage well. Okay. So that passage is talking about how
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.880]   Christ fulfilled his work on the cross, but he says how will this become effective if
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.420]   they do not hear? And how will they hear if they are not sent? So he's talking about there's
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.480]   a gap between what Christ has done and the evangelization, right? And making of disciples.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:30.660]   So Paul says we need to send people to bridge that gap. Like we need to go. So what is the
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:40.600]   best interpretation of this? In light of everything else that we see. Paul is bridging the gap
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.200]   between his finished work on the cross and evangelizing and getting the word out. And
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.440]   if you read the context of the text that we're looking at, that's exactly what he's talking
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.920]   about. His own ministry of the gospel. Right? So he's not talking about atonement. That
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.120]   he's bridging the gap, what is lacking in atonement. He's saying in evangelizing to
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.320]   get the word out. You understand what I'm saying? Okay. So if we get this wrong, this
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.160]   is where bad doctrine comes from. And this is why so many Christians are intimidated
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:18.320]   to talk to cult members because they quote passages. And most Christians are not aware
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.120]   of the passage that they're quoting is out of context. Right? And so it's very, very
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:30.380]   important that when you are studying the scripture that you know not only what that verse says,
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.180]   but the context in which it is said. That's why even memorizing scripture, you know, I've
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:41.120]   had so many scripture verses that I memorized out of context. And years later as I was studying
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.720]   the Bible, what I thought it said was completely different when I began to study it. Right?
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.320]   Like, there's still value in studying, I mean, memorizing scripture topically. But it's equally
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.360]   important, maybe even more important that you understand the context in which that verse
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   came out of. Or else that's where bad doctrine typically comes from. Okay? So that's one
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.280]   of the principles that I hope you remember. That's why cross references is always important.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.160]   Especially early on in studying the Bible. If you're studying the scriptures and you
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.880]   say, wow, this is a great revelation. Make sure you double check with other cross references
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.560]   that is consistent with what he said in other passages. Okay? All right. Let's jump in.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.160]   As I did last week and the previous weeks, I divided the text into an outline. And that's
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.600]   why I kind of divided the way I did. I saw, again, number two in the outline that I gave
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.360]   you, outline of this passage in three parts. Verse 21 to 23, it gives our past, present,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:53.840]   and future standing before God. So before we jump into the text, to get a broad outline
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.400]   of his flow of thought. So that you're going to, when you're studying the word or you're
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.280]   studying the sentence or you're studying the paragraph, you understand what he is saying
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.680]   before and what he's saying after. Right? To always understand it in context. So he
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.520]   starts out, at least in this text, about our past, present, and future standing before
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:22.400]   God, 24 to 27, Paul's calling to the gospel ministry. And then thirdly, verse 28 to 29,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.080]   Paul's work in the gospel ministry. How is God accomplishing this work through Paul?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:38.160]   Verse 28 through 29. Okay. That's already written for you, so you don't need to write
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.440]   all that. All right. So the first section, I said past, present, and future. So if you
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:50.160]   look at verse 21, again, none of this is something that you have to go to the commentary for.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.560]   If you spent enough time in front of this text, you can gain these insights for yourself.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:07.840]   Okay? So if you look at the first three verses, you can clearly see that there is a
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:15.720]   past component of the first verse. Right? He says, "Although you were formerly alienated
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:23.400]   and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds." And then the present, "But now, he has now
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:34.280]   reconciled you through his fleshly body and to present you blameless." And then the future
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:41.160]   is called to persevere, to continue to go forward. Right? So in the first section, verse
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:52.040]   21, 22, and 23, past, present, and future of where we stand before God. Right? Remember
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.800]   one of the things that I asked you to do when you're looking for observations, that see
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:12.960]   if you see any contrasting ideas. Do you see any in this section? How do you see it? Okay.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:22.920]   Alienated and reconciled. Okay? Right? Before we were alienated, now we're reconciled. Anything
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:43.840]   else? Hostile in mind. Okay, that's not the word I want to use. Hostile in mind. Right?
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:50.400]   Talking about the mind being hostile, being reconciled in the flesh. Right? So if you
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:57.640]   look at the third part, "Engaged in the evil deeds, but presented as blameless." Right?
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:05.320]   So he's talking about, so each one of these lines basically nullifies the other. Was reconciled,
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:11.760]   was alienated, but reconciled. Hostile in mind, but atoned in the flesh. Engaged in
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.440]   evil deeds, presented to be holy. Right? So I don't think it's by accident. Paul is basically
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.800]   systematically targeting, this is who you were, but what Jesus did nullifies and transferred
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:32.360]   you. Right? And then the third verse, he points to the future where he says, "But if indeed
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:42.800]   you continue in the faith." So this is not passive. He's not saying, "This is what happened."
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:49.320]   That you just kind of enjoy yourself. He adds that if this is you, and it will be continued
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:57.480]   to be you, if you continue in the faith, firmly established, steadfast, and not moved away.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.840]   So all three of these words are basically saying the same thing. That you continue this
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.800]   path. You persevere. Right? You don't just hear it and say, "Oh, we're justified and
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.080]   that we're just waiting to get to heaven." He talks about sanctification and the idea
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.640]   of persevering is staying steadfast. How do we stay steadfast? In faith, from the hope
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.440]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Right? Staying grounded in the hope. So one of the questions
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:29.040]   that I asked in your discussion question is, if our justification, he says, will carry
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:36.260]   us on to completion if we hold fast to our confession in faith. Right? And remain steadfast.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.120]   So these aren't just passive, where you're just kind of on the boat and you're just floating.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.560]   And that's the problem with the Hebrews. Right? The recipient of Hebrews was they got on the
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:53.220]   boat and they're just drifting. But here he says to hold fast. Right? In faith. Okay?
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:16:09.200]   So past, present, and future. The second part, verse 23, 24 to 27, talking about Paul's ministry.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:19.600]   So, there's five things that I observed about Paul's ministry. One, he says he rejoiced
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:25.040]   in the suffering for your sake. One of the questions that came up when he says, "When
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:43.060]   he reconciled." What verse was that? Yeah, verse 22. Yeah, he is clearly referring to
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.520]   Christ because he's talking about how he reconciled in his body. Okay? That was one of the questions
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:54.160]   that came in. All right. So the five things that I noticed in verse 24 through 27 about
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:03.520]   Paul's ministry is that Paul considered his suffering a joy. Okay? Now, an average person,
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.480]   you know, it's like, "Well, he's an apostle of Jesus Christ. There's a special anointing
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.880]   in him. And he says that." But how many times do you see a Christian, like, actually saying,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.840]   "I'm suffering for your sake and I rejoice over it." Right? If somebody said that, we
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.480]   would almost be cynical thinking you're fake. Like, be real. Tell me how you really feel.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.520]   Right? Now, we would never accuse Apostle Paul of that because he's an apostle. But
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.840]   I think that's directly linked to what he said previously. If his hope is firmly grounded
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.360]   in Christ, yes, his suffering is leading to greater glory. And it's because of his great
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.400]   faith he's able to see it in joy. Right? But if your hope is laid up here, how can
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:50.800]   suffering be rejoicing? It's only when you see suffering as a way of greater glory. Right?
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.600]   And if you believe that. So, one, he says his suffering. And then, what suffering is
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:06.840]   he talking about here? What context is he writing this letter? Remember? Huh? He's
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.160]   a prisoner. So, this is one of the prisoner epistles. So, he's in Rome writing this letter.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:19.320]   So, when he says he's suffering, everybody's aware where he is. Right? And then he says,
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:29.760]   number two, his work for the church. And in my flesh I do my share on behalf of the body.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:49.360]   And then third, in work for Christ. And then fourth, that God gave him this stewardship.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:57.040]   He's rejoicing. He's doing his part for the church. He's doing his part for the gospel.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:04.440]   And spreading the gospel. Fourth, he says he was appointed by God. And fifthly, he's
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:11.800]   talking about the message itself. Right? Is a mystery. So, when he says God appointed
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.320]   him to be able to fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, he says the full, the
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:23.740]   preaching of the word of God is making the mystery known. Like that's God's will. Right?
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:31.480]   What was hidden, now they know. But there's so much more to be revealed. Even now. Right?
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.700]   How many of you, and again this is a rhetorical question, have been Christians more than ten
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:40.580]   years and did not make the connection of Leviticus to the New Testament? Right? It's a rhetorical
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:47.180]   question. You don't have to answer. My guess is most of you didn't. Right? Because it's
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:53.700]   just not taught. But those of you who made the connection, now look back at it. How important,
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:02.460]   how important is Leviticus in understanding the gospel? Crucial. Right? Now how many Christians
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.100]   in our, you know, in our area or around the world do you think understand that connection
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.580]   between what God was doing in Leviticus in understanding the depth of the gospel? Right?
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:19.340]   Very few. So, Paul says the preaching of the gospel is the mystery being revealed. And
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.780]   so he describes his preaching of the gospel as connecting the dots. What Christ has done
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.820]   and what God had done in the Old Testament. Right? And that was preaching of the gospel.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.340]   So the preaching of the gospel isn't simply God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:38.980]   life. The gospel actually begins in the Old Testament. Right? Gospel doesn't start in
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:45.940]   Matthew chapter one. It starts in the beginning. All of it is the gospel. So when somebody
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.580]   says you know you got to preach the gospel and say God loves you, has a wonderful plan
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.740]   for your life. That's, they're starting at the midpoint. Starting point is all of sin
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:59.060]   and fall short of the glory of God. Right? And what God was doing through all of that.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:15.100]   Okay. So the third part, verse 28 through 29, Paul's work in the gospel ministry. I don't
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:22.020]   know if you can read my writing. All right. So four things I saw. One, we proclaim him.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:28.700]   So at the core of this mystery being revealed is Christ himself. Right? That's why you probably
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.980]   hear all the times that all of the Bible is about Christ. Because Christ is at the center
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:38.420]   of all of this. Not only is he the creator, not only is the sustainer, not only is he
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:45.540]   the goal, he's the mediator. Right? He's the fulfiller. All of the Bible at the center
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:54.280]   of it is Christ. Right? So remember we talked about context. If you're interpreting a passage
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.740]   and you're preaching something and you don't know how to connect that to Christ, you probably
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:08.820]   didn't interpret that correctly. Okay? I give you an example about the book of Jonah. Right?
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.700]   The point of that story is not don't mess with God or Wales is going to kill you. The
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:20.060]   end. What does that have to do with redemptive history? Not saying that there aren't principles
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.260]   where God teaches us how to behave. Like does the Bible teach us don't mess with God? Yes.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.300]   Does the Bible teach us that we need to rely on him? All of these things are true. But
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.300]   if the central message is Christ and you don't see any connection to Christ, you probably
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:41.180]   miss the bigger picture in that text. Right? So the central message of Jonah is God raised
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:49.340]   up the nation of Israel to be a light to the world. Right? And he was self-focused. Israel
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.020]   only cared about Israel. God said from the very beginning that I'm going to bless you
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.340]   and through you many other nations are going to be blessed. But they completely forgot
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:02.140]   about that. So all of that in redemptive history. And the same thing with the church. He said
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.980]   if we are the light and we lose the light, right? And we're for the salt of the world
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.300]   and we lose our saltiness. He said what good is it for? That's basically what was happening
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:20.020]   with the nation of Israel. Right? So number one, Paul's ministry was proclaiming Christ
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:27.540]   at the center. Two, the work was admonishing every man and teaching every man with all
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:35.540]   wisdom. So right off in Matthew chapter 28, right? Make disciples, baptizing them in the
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.060]   name of the father, son, and holy spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:45.420]   you. So it's not like he's not simply saying God is awesome, he died for us, isn't he awesome,
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:51.860]   let's go to heaven. Right? So Paul's preaching and preaching about Christ includes admonishing,
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:59.140]   teaching, rebuking, training in righteousness. Right? So that process of sanctification is
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:06.180]   part of what it means to put our hope in Christ. So that was also his preaching. So again,
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:12.180]   for whatever the reason in our modern era, preaching imperative has been dismissed as
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:18.340]   moralism. Right? It's moralism if you don't connect that to Christ. But if you connect
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.940]   it to Christ, Christ will always call us to holiness. So you can't separate these two
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.940]   things. You can't separate the preaching of the gospel and then say imperatives are legalism.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:35.580]   Because imperatives are part of the gospel. Right? We no longer obey the law, but we obey
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:46.740]   the law of what? Christ. Right? So that's number two. Three, to present everyone, every
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:53.660]   man complete in Christ. Right? So he's not just teaching and he's not just training.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:59.080]   His goal is to bring them to the end conclusion. So the word for complete here basically means
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:08.500]   to bring them to the logical end. So the point of justification is to be reconciled so that
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:14.080]   they can go back to where God intended. That's what the word complete means. It doesn't mean
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.500]   complete perfect that somehow during this lifetime you're going to be complete. Right?
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.980]   You're never going to sin. You never have doubts. You never have, you know, you do anything
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:30.020]   wrong. The word complete basically means to bring to completion. So in other words, God
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:38.080]   justifies us in order to sanctify us. Right? Those two things are not separate. So Paul's
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:44.040]   ministry preaching Christ, admonishing every man to bring him to the logical conclusion
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.880]   of their salvation. To make every man complete. And then finally he says all of this by the
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:58.240]   power that's working within him. So it starts with him. Right? You can't be an effective
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:06.120]   minister at any capacity. Small group, one to one, college, singles, married, family.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:13.680]   You can't be effective in any way if the work is not all first happening with you. He says
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:20.560]   he's laboring according to the power which mightily works within me. So the primary and
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.960]   the most important thing that every Christian has to be is making sure that Christ is affecting
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:33.160]   you first. Because everything else that you do without Christ affecting you is just your
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   labor is kicking against the goal. Building something that you have no power to build.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.280]   Bringing someone from darkness to light. You have no power to do that. It's only when
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.920]   the Holy Spirit is working in us and through us. And that's what Paul says. Okay? Right.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   So again, we can go deep into any one of these things, but again the goal of this is for
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:00.800]   you to see, again, if you spend enough time in front of the Bible and just ask questions,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.120]   outlining, thinking, cross-referencing back and forth, that these are insights that any
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:13.120]   one of you can have. Okay? And so my hope and prayer is that you would learn to do quiet
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.200]   time in this way. That you don't just skim through three chapters and say I did my quiet
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.840]   time. But sit there and dig. Because so much comes out when you take your time. Especially
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.480]   those of you guys who are memorizing the book of James. Right? Even sometimes after you've
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.680]   memorized it, like years later you'll be thinking about it. Oh, that's what that meant. Right?
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.760]   Because you have it in your head, but you haven't really like, you didn't really dig.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:44.280]   Right? So anytime you study the scripture, just take some time. All scripture is inspired
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.960]   by God. Every part of it. Right? So you want to make sure like you understand. Just like
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:55.000]   if you're reading a love letter, you dissect every word, every sentence. Right? Every smiley
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.800]   face. What does this X mean? What does this O mean? Oh, it's kisses and hugs. Right? She
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.080]   put ten of them instead of three. What does this mean? So just like you would study a
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.880]   love letter in depth, you would, you know what I mean? This is more important than a
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:16.960]   love letter. This is a redemptive letter from God himself. Right? So you can't say I want
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.440]   to know God and then not devote yourself to scripture. Because he revealed himself through
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.800]   his word. So if you want to know God, you have to commit to study of the word. And it's
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:33.400]   different than me telling you how much God loves you versus you hearing it yourself from
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:40.920]   studying the word of God. Okay? All right. So next week's passage, Colossians
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:46.440]   1, Colossians 2, 1 through 8. And then the discussion questions are here from 1 through
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.720]   4. And I'll let you guys get into your group. Okay? Let me pray first and then I'll dismiss
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:59.960]   you to your group. Heavenly Father, I pray for your blessing upon our small group time.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:05.360]   And I know that many brothers here and sisters who've come from work and a long day, I pray
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:12.000]   that you would encourage and refresh their tired souls. We pray that the discussion would
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.880]   be honest, open, and that we would learn to be vulnerable, Lord God, toward one another.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.520]   But whatever it is that we pursue, we pursue Father God in spirit and in truth. And so
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.840]   I ask for your blessing. I ask for those who are facilitating that you would give them
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.120]   wisdom. And so we ask for your blessing over this time. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   Thanks for listening.
