[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   Cool, all right, well let's turn our Bibles over to Colossians chapter one.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.240]   Colossians chapter one.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.840]   And we'll be reading from verse 24 down to verse 29.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.520]   Passage says, words from the Lord here through Apostle Paul.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.560]   "Now rejoice in my suffering for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.480]   his body, which is the church, and filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980]   Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140]   for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.500]   That is the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.880]   now been manifested to his saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:06.160]   of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.560]   We proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.360]   we may present every man complete in Christ.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.400]   For this purpose also I labor, striving according to his power, which mightily works within
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.400]   me."
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.400]   Let's take a moment to pray, ask for God's blessing.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.640]   Our God, we want to pray again, Lord, that as your word is, as we open up your word,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.240]   that God, you would continue to teach us and guide us and lead us by way of your truth.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.400]   But ultimately, Father God, we also pray that you would work so deeply in our hearts and
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.000]   in our minds.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.080]   For much of the words that we hear, God, perhaps we've heard before, but God, would you ingrain
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.560]   them, would you ultimately use it to affect us deeply and cause us to be transformed into
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800]   the image of your son?
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.520]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   Amen.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   Okay.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   Well, I want to ask you a question here, and the question simply is, have you ever started
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.600]   something only to quit?
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.200]   I'm sure we all have.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.720]   Have you ever began some kind of endeavor, whether small or big, and then found yourself
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   wanting to just give up and give in?
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.200]   There are lots of things that we take strides to accomplish only to give up.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.280]   There are things that are not so substantial and then things that are really important.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.200]   So there are things like, you know, diet and exercise, and we quit on those every year.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.460]   You know, it's like an annual thing.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.440]   There are things like learning an instrument and trying to strive after gaining some new
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.720]   skill, or it can be, again, more substantial.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.120]   There are many of us maybe who started a path of education and we were trying to, you know,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.880]   obtain some kind of degree only to realize, nope, that's not for me.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.400]   Or maybe in work, certain things that are, again, more heavy in weight or whatever it
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   may be.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.360]   Now, those things happen.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.160]   In our lives, sometimes we start something and then we realize down the road that that's
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.840]   not for us.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.720]   But the thing about it is, the reason why I bring that up is because in each one of
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.080]   those moments, there is a decision to be made and that decision is incredibly difficult,
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.440]   is it not?
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.040]   If you guys have ever been in any one of those scenarios where you've invested, at least
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.360]   maybe even like financially, your tuition or something like, you know, tuition for schooling
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.680]   or whatever it may be, or you invested yourself into some kind of relationship, whatever it
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.120]   may be, trying to decide is incredibly difficult.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120]   Yes?
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   Yes.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.080]   Now, what I'm going to say is this, is that in our minds then, how we make that decision,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.440]   I believe is pretty uniform.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.160]   That we all have to consider in trying to accomplish this thing, we have to ask that
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.000]   question, is it worth it?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.280]   Is it worth me continuing to push myself and is it worth me investing my finances, energy,
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.200]   time, and sweat in order to accomplish this?
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.160]   And so that's why sometimes it's not a bad decision to quit because, yeah, sometimes
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.360]   circumstantially priorities come into our lives and yes, going to the gym is not worth
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.760]   me actually, let's say, doing something more important, whether it be if you're neglecting
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.320]   family time and you just want extra family time so you let go of this.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.240]   Those decisions are made, but in the end, what you're deciding is, what is worth more
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   to me?
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.040]   Does that make sense?
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.520]   In the end, you're trying to decide, is this investment worth it?
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   And that is what I would like to challenge us today.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.600]   Today as we read this passage, Apostle Paul is talking about a striving, a laboring, a
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.080]   joyful laboring, but nonetheless a still labor.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.860]   He is agonizing over something and the thing about it is he's saying to us really loudly,
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.680]   this is all worth it.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.640]   And so today, perhaps it might be something where we're looking at the passage and you're
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.400]   gaining some kind of crazy new insight, but perhaps today is more like things that you
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.240]   already know, things that you're already striving for.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.280]   I want to give a challenge.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.680]   There are certain things in our lives, yes, it's okay to decide this is not worth it,
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.800]   but there are other things, especially what the scripture is teaching us, we need to see
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.040]   it all the way to the end.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.120]   We need to make sure that we persevere all the way until not we decide it's okay to quit,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.920]   but until God relieves us of the responsibility.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.200]   And that's why I've entitled this sermon, Until It Is Complete.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.640]   Until it is complete that we have to gain a continual motivation, we have to gain a
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:49.280]   sight, a vision, we have to gain a faith perspective where what we see to be our lot, what God
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.680]   has designed for us, what God has willed for us, that these things are so worth it, yes,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.440]   absolutely worth my time, absolutely worth my sacrifice, absolutely worth everything
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.520]   I've got to give.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.600]   So let's look at that passage again.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.160]   I'm going to look at Colossians chapter one, and we're going to actually look at pretty
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160]   much the whole of chapter one.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.280]   I've been doing my devotions through this passage, and these are the things that pretty
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.640]   much stuck out to me and I wanted to share with you.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.720]   We're looking at verse 24, and we see Apostle Paul saying this.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:33.480]   He says, excuse me, he says, "Now I rejoice in my suffering for your sake, and in my flesh
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.760]   I do my share on behalf of his body," which is the church, "and filling up what is lacking
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.020]   in Christ's affliction.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.720]   Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God, bestowed on me
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.500]   for your benefit."
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.320]   So just right there what you see is Apostle Paul saying, "I am happy to be doing what
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   I'm doing.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.560]   I am laboring on your behalf.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.000]   I feel a calling."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.520]   He knows the role that God has given him, and he is working hard.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.680]   So what I'm saying is simply just what's obvious is he's motivated.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.520]   He's got a purpose.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.400]   So the first theme and the first point I would like us to understand is he's got a joy for
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.200]   his suffering.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.760]   He's got a joy for his suffering, and because what I'm saying is he's got that joy for his
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.000]   suffering because he's got a very clear intention.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   We're looking at the purpose that Apostle Paul is looking at, and he says in verse 29,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   if you scroll your eyes down there, we proclaim, oh sorry, verse 29, "For this purpose also
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.680]   I labor, striving according to his power, which mightily works within me."
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.800]   So he says very explicitly, "I have a very clear purpose for which I am striving."
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.000]   What's more, he wants you to know it.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.440]   Just scroll your eyes to chapter 2, verse 1, and he says, "For I want you to know how
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.280]   great a struggle I have on your behalf and those who are at Laodicea."
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.960]   So not only is he just working hard, he actually wants you to know he's working hard because
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.160]   what he's going to do is in his own work ethic, he's going to push you, the audience, he's
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.320]   pushing the church to pursue that same purpose.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.200]   So the way that you should be thinking about this is kind of like your parents pushing
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.280]   you so hard, right?
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.280]   I don't know what kind of parents you have, but I'm sure all of your parents want the
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.160]   absolute best for you and they'll typically say stuff like, "I want you to do well in
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.160]   school.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   Quit messing around."
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.720]   If you're a collegian sometimes and your parents are really heavy on you and saying, "Quit
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.440]   diddle-dying, pick a major, I want you to do well."
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.280]   And then they'll always say that phrase, "Do you know how much we had to work to put you
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.280]   through?"
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.640]   If you've been supported through, "Do you know how much we worked?
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.040]   Do you know how hard it was?"
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.000]   Honestly for me, I come from an immigrant family, my parents moved, we moved to the
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.200]   US back in 1989 and truthfully now I understand better just the move itself was an incredible
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   risk.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.680]   I mean just think about that.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.760]   I mean to have young children and just start, just for the hope, like we have never been
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.040]   there, we've never visited and we have no promise it's going to be better, but just
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.800]   for the prospect that life would be better for you, you are children, here we go.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.480]   Take a huge risk to pack their bags and take the whole family to an area they have no friends.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.200]   And I think about that, I was like, "Would I have ever made that decision?"
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.280]   It's pretty crazy and many people don't make that decision, but sure enough they remind
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.680]   me.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.360]   Every time they're trying to motivate me, they'll remind me, "Do you have any idea what
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.520]   risk it took?
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   How much labor?"
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.360]   And then yeah, they remind me of, "You realize we've been working without vacations and all
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.960]   this stuff just for you could have a better opportunity."
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.640]   And then that's why I remember when I was telling them, "Ma, Appa, I want to be an art
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.640]   major."
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.320]   They're like, "No."
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   And then I pick philosophy and they're like, "No."
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.520]   Well I remember during that college years, having that conversation with my parents and
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.280]   them telling me, "I want you to know how much we struggled for you so that you take this
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.160]   seriously."
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.000]   And to tell you truthfully, when I was young, yeah, I looked at that with a sense of like,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.280]   "Ah, let me decide.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280]   Stop pushing me."
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.640]   But looking back, yeah, it would have been more noble of me as a young man to realize
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:23.440]   like I have a very unique privilege for our parents to have labored and strived so diligently
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.280]   to provide an opportunity for their children.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.520]   Likewise, possible Paul saying, "I want you to know how great a struggle I had for you.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.320]   So the next things I'm going to say to you, you better take seriously, right?
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.640]   You better take wholeheartedly."
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.720]   And so he continues on.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.400]   Now in order to add, not to simply add effect, but in order to gain a Paul's perspective,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.680]   what I'm going to do now is direct your attention to verse three of chapter one.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.240]   So Colossians chapter one, verse three, and we'll work down his mentality and his heart
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.940]   behind all this.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.480]   So chapter one, verse three, he says, "We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.080]   Jesus Christ, praying always for you, right?
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.600]   Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.120]   because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.280]   of truth, the gospel, which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is constantly
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:28.240]   bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.400]   of it and understood the grace of God in truth.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.000]   Just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bondservant, who is a faithful
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.160]   servant of Christ on our behalf, and he also informed us of your love in the spirit."
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.400]   So so far, really good.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.160]   Apostle Paul says, "I've heard of your faith and we're hearing that you heard the truth
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.960]   of the gospel and you received it.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.920]   You really took it in to the degree that it's really even taking effect in your life and
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.840]   it's being told of that you love one another, that you're bearing fruit and it's increasing."
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.360]   But I want you to understand this.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.800]   I'm talking about the intent, purpose, and the drive of Apostle Paul, and what he says
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.640]   is, "You're doing well, and so I'm praying for you."
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.600]   Take a look at verse 9.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:21.000]   "For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased praying for you."
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.480]   So does that strike you as kind of strange?
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.120]   Because typically, if we're talking about an unceasing, unrelenting prayer, we're praying
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.760]   for people who are hurting.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:36.760]   Like if you're sick, like really sick, then maybe we'd say things like, "Man, I'm praying
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   for you."
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.920]   But in this scenario, Apostle Paul is saying, "I've heard great things about you and good.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.160]   You're growing, but I'm praying for you day and night unceasingly.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.360]   I'm always thinking about you."
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   This is what I'm saying.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.120]   It's unusual because Apostle Paul has this drive.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.360]   He is not only struggling, laboring, but he's on his knees praying for everybody.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   And so I want to talk to our congregation.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.720]   I always feel an incredible sense of privilege to be a part of our congregation because I
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   see it.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   People are growing.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   People are learning.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.800]   They're hungry and stuff.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:21.200]   But understand that we will never be satisfied with just simply, "Good, we're members here.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.280]   Kudos to you."
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.880]   And especially if some of you are sitting here thinking, "Well, I try to read my Bible.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   I'm pretty consistent.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   I pray.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.280]   I participate at church.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.440]   Things are good."
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.760]   My challenge today was not simply, "Okay, we're fine."
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.960]   But the challenge is, "Still excel more."
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.120]   First Thessalonians chapter 4, verse 1 and 2 say exactly the same thing.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.880]   "You have faith, you shall love great.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.720]   Excel all the more."
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.400]   Apostle Paul here is not satisfied with simply saying, "Good, you heard the gospel."
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:59.960]   No, he's saying, "I'm striving and laboring and pursuing you with an intention and purpose
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.480]   that you would have more."
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.920]   So what is that more?
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.400]   What would cause Apostle Paul to keep on praying day and night over a congregation that's already
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.140]   doing well?
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.000]   And that comes in the next passage.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.720]   Continuing on in verse 9, Apostle Paul says this, "He is praying unceasingly and asking
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.000]   that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.500]   so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord to please him in all respects, bearing
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.320]   fruit in every good work and increasing in," what?
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.800]   "The knowledge of God, strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.680]   the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father who has
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.280]   qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light."
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.240]   Did you see the theme of what he's saying?
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.120]   Did you see the intent?
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.000]   The purpose?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.120]   He says very clearly, "I want you to be filled with the knowledge of the will of God in all
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.760]   spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.800]   I want you to know what pleases him.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.000]   I want you to increase in the knowledge of God."
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.680]   Three times he is repeating a concept.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:21.840]   And so this is the next point, to be filled with a true understanding of God.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.200]   To be filled with a true understanding of God.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.120]   The idea here is if you can just imagine with me a nice pretty jar and just fill in that
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:37.520]   with the most delicious, most refreshing, just amazing drink and just filling it up
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.560]   to the top.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.440]   Because if there is an amazing, delicious drink, you're not going to just fill it like
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.040]   this much and say, "Hmm."
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.600]   No, you're going to want the whole jar.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.160]   So imagine with me that because that's the kind of picture he's talking about, saying,
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.720]   "I want you to be filled to the degree where you're overflowing."
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.200]   I don't want you to be half full.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.760]   I want you to be so full that you're overflowing and it's now producing its fruit.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.600]   It's having its effect.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.320]   Now I can sit here and go in detail about the Greek word is plero and all this kind
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   of stuff.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.280]   But honestly, we understand what he's saying.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.400]   So what do we need to do?
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.840]   Take that picture, the jar overflowing with this delicious, very expensive maybe, and
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.720]   whatever it may be, this refreshing drink you're thinking about, pina colada, I don't
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   know.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.440]   So anyway, you've got this drink.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:31.880]   My question to you is, does that describe you?
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.400]   Is that describing you?
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.320]   That's at the heart of what the Apostle Paul is going to be talking about here is for you,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.880]   are you growing with God in this manner?
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.120]   Or is the picture you would most relate with is like, "Ah, you know, the water, I'm
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.240]   trying to fill it, but then it evaporates, you know, in my mind.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   Like I forget.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.640]   It's like, oh, I'm trying to fill it, but there's all these distractions.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.720]   And then half the time I'm like looking the other way and it's just kind of just dribbling
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.040]   all over the table, but not necessarily into the cup."
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.160]   I mean, what is actually describing where you are right now?
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.720]   I say this as an encouragement and challenge to you.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.480]   This is not new for us as an exhortation that we have to grow in the knowledge of God.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:17.080]   But the fact of the matter is that is going to be the spiritual endeavor and struggle
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:23.200]   which we are going to be laboring and battling and perhaps sometimes stumbling, right?
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.960]   And now I want you essentially to take a moment to do self-evaluation.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.980]   What is going to describe you right now?
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.920]   Is it that kind of cup where essentially it's been left out, not filled, and so it's all
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:38.200]   crusty because when you leave a drink in there and it evaporates, all you get is residue?
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.320]   So all you have is residue knowledge.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.040]   Is that you?
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.440]   Now moving aside from the metaphorical, more specifically with God, are you growing with
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.800]   God?
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.720]   Because the fact of the matter is, let me make this point, he is not saying I want you
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.520]   to be filled simply with doctrine.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.760]   He's not just saying I want you to exercise your brain and make sure you're in academia.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.800]   He is saying I want you to know the will of God.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.720]   Specifically he says I want you to know what pleases Him.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.320]   I want you to understand Him.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.760]   So my question to you is are you growing in Him in a way where it's a growing relationship,
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.840]   not so much as like okay, growing relationship, I feel good about Him, but you're actually
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.000]   able to tell me.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.360]   You can anticipate what He likes and what He doesn't like, what He's pleased by and
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.320]   what He's not pleased by.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.540]   You do this all the time with your other relationships.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.800]   If you're dating, I remember the first couple times like in dates or whatever, like you
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.880]   just are aware, you're very like in tune with the way that they say things about you.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.720]   So if she makes, you know, like we're dating and I wear an ugly shirt and she's like, oh,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   why'd you wear that shirt?
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.080]   I'm like, next time, it's like throw it out.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   You know, like you're not going to wear it because you're very in tune with what that
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.600]   person likes and doesn't like.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.920]   To the degree, those of you guys who have been in a relationship, after a while you
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.760]   go shopping, it's like ooh, they'll love this.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760]   Why?
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   Because you know them.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.200]   You know, there was this time when I was at a brother's house and I respect him so
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:09.440]   much as a kind of advanced in age and he's a good father and all this kind of stuff.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.760]   And at the time I was a younger dad, like newbie dad, and I was like, oh, struggling
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.760]   with when do you know to be stern?
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.760]   When do you know to be merciful?
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.040]   When do you know to be, you know, and that's the typical question.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.600]   It's like when do I know to do this and do this?
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.240]   I know you're supposed to, but when?
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.240]   You know?
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   Well, the kids are playing and all that kind of stuff and sure enough when the kids are
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.680]   playing by themselves and the adults are at the table, all of a sudden you hear the bickering
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.480]   like I heard it first, you know?
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.680]   And then after a while, one of the children comes over and they've got that really whiny,
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.000]   like tight throated, like, you know?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.040]   And I'm sitting there like, oh, I wonder what the dad's going to do?
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.360]   Because you know, I've been reading those books and the books say like never let your
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.280]   child, you know, have tantrums and you got to snip that complaining thing in the butt
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.440]   and then the Bible says do all things without complaining and grumbling, especially with
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   your annoying voice, you know?
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.600]   Like, I don't know what he was, I was anticipating he would say, but I was sitting here thinking
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.440]   like, ooh, I think he's going to lay that smack down, right?
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.960]   So I'm all waiting and then the child was like really just tight and everything was
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   so frustrated.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   The father just leans over and goes, come here, hey, I understand.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.840]   And you can just see the child just like melt like, and then he just started like a little
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.280]   tear, you know, like everything and I was just like kind of flabbergasted and then the
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.640]   child just ran off and then it was like everything was okay.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.400]   And I was just like impressed, kind of flabbergasted all at the same time.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.160]   So I had to ask like, oh, how did you think to do that?
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.840]   Like when do you do that?
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.560]   Like when do you, when do you, when do you do, how do you know what you need to do?
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.800]   You know, and I was like, I was just asking him.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.200]   And then he was like, and I even said like, you know, like I read in the books, like I
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.080]   remember reading this like how to lead your family in a godly manner and all that kind
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   of stuff.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.600]   And I was like, I remember in the books you got to like really snip that.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   So what do you do?
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   Like is that being too lenient?
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.360]   And he was like, he said something profound to me.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.760]   He said, you know, yeah, like I read some of those stuff too.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.560]   And yeah, there's like a lot of good principles and stuff, but I don't know about all that
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.960]   right now, but I know my child.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.520]   And at that moment I was just like, huh.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.920]   And he said, you know, I want to encourage you with something.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.320]   If you want to be a good husband and a good father, you will never stop growing in an
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.000]   understanding of who your family is.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.560]   So just keep understanding and knowing exactly how your children operate.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.720]   Now the thing about it is they keep growing and still like changing on you.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.440]   So like the process never ends, you know.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.400]   And I remember just thinking, wow, so simple, but profound, you know, like I was like mind
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   blown.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.880]   But the fact of the matter is like, that's what I'm talking about here is you can sit
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.200]   doctrinally and ask like, this is what you do, this is what you do.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.680]   And then you can get stuck asking what's your will for me, God?
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.000]   What's your will for me, God?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.880]   And actually being able to understand what God's will for you is because you don't understand
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.880]   God.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.600]   And the challenge that I'm asking us to understand is Apostle Paul saying, I want you to understand
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.660]   his inner working, his mind, so that you understand what's pleasing to him.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.720]   You understand what's spiritual wisdom, right?
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.480]   This is more than just simple like, give me the do's and don'ts so that it'd be a little
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.660]   bit easier about how to live my life.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.960]   This is understanding God.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.680]   And so Apostle Paul says, this is what I'm striving as for, this is what I'm praying
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.680]   for.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.240]   I want you to understand God's heart.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.120]   And in many ways, you guys know God's will.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.160]   We've asked that question multiple times in our lives, like what is God's will for me?
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.960]   And we've got to answer that.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.600]   The scripture is chock full of, and this is the will of God for you.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.980]   This is the will of God for you that you be sanctified.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.400]   This is the will of God for you that you be holy.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.880]   This is the will of God for you that you be so loving because you know God.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.240]   This is the will of God for you that you build his church.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.640]   This is the will of God for you that you be a witness and a glorious light and a testimony
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.920]   to his greatness.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.280]   That's the will of God for you, right?
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:05.040]   But here in this passage, what I'm highlighting is that God through Apostle Paul is challenging
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   the church.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:12.240]   This is the will of God for you, that you know God, that you strive and seek to understand
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.240]   Christ, that you strive and seek to understand the person, the Savior by which we claim his
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   name.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.000]   Yes, we have various things that we endeavor in our lives, and yes, I'm talking about a
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.320]   pretty big topic, just the general knowledge of God, but my question of evaluation to you
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:35.560]   is, is this what you're striving for without giving up, seeing it to the end?
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560]   That's the challenge.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.840]   I want to give you that motivation.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.480]   This is the thing that Apostle Paul is saying, "I've labored so hard for you to do.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:50.120]   I've literally put myself at risk, being threatened, being persecuted so you can have the gospel.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.440]   I want you so dearly then to know Christ through this truth."
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.040]   Then our response has got to be, "Then give it to me.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   I want to know it.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.360]   Are you praying to God, 'God, give me knowledge, not just doctrinal knowledge, not just smarts
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.160]   and wit, but I want to know your heart.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.240]   I want to know what pleases you.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.280]   I want to know your will.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.680]   I want to know what you desire.'"
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.360]   I mean, these are the things you need to be praying for.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.440]   That's the challenge today.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.520]   Please take a look here.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.600]   If you go to chapter two, Colossians chapter two, this is essentially all that he says
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.640]   in an explicit fashion.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.160]   He says, starting from verse one, "For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:37.560]   you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not seen me face to face, that their
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.600]   hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the," what?
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.240]   "riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   is," what?
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.520]   "Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:59.280]   I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments, no worldly philosophy,
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.160]   no mantra of this age, no worldly wisdom."
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.360]   He says, "I want you to have a very simplistic goal for your life.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   Seek the treasures in Christ, of knowing him deeply."
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.440]   And in that, in that is where Apostle Paul finds his purpose.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.860]   That is where we need to find our purpose.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:25.680]   This is God's desire for you to have this understanding, this deep, intimate knowledge
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.080]   of the Lord.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:33.440]   So we talk about the cup, we talk about being filled, and I want you really to take time
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.060]   this morning to think and evaluate, where am I with that?
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:42.100]   To what degree have I been seeking that kind of simplistic desire to know him?
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.680]   So that is the kind of knowledge that we speak about.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.600]   Now, we got to ask the question, how, right?
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.400]   If we go from empty cup and we want to look to full cup, how?
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.360]   How do we go from not knowing and understanding the will of God to understanding the will
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   of God?
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.160]   Well, I could give you the simple answer.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   I could give you the answer that's already in your mind.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.960]   You know I'm going to say it.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.460]   Use your Bible, right?
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.540]   But here I want to talk about something that's really important because this is something
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.140]   Jesus mentions.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:20.560]   That in order to know God, there has to be a preemptive decision, right?
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.420]   God says in various passages in the book of Psalms and John chapter 6, who does he reveal
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.180]   his will to?
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.860]   Who does he reveal these mysteries to?
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:36.940]   Who does God choose to say, "Here, I reveal and give you the understanding of my heart"?
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.120]   There are individuals who've made a preemptive decision.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.520]   What is that preemptive decision?
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.720]   That preemptive decision is one who says, "Whatever your will may be, before you even
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.380]   show it to me, I'm committed to do it."
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:54.860]   It's a heart that is already preconditioned, it's prepped, it's primed.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.820]   That should God desire to show you various things of how he wants to bless you, to use
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.220]   you, to move in you and work in your life, you're already primed and ready and say, "I
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.820]   will receive that wholeheartedly."
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.180]   Why?
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.940]   Because I've made a decision, God, whatever your will may be, I will do it.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.860]   That was the heart of Jesus.
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:22.140]   Remember in John chapter 6, he says, "I have come down from heaven not to do my own will,
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.980]   but the will of him who sent me.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.860]   This is the will whom sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he's given me."
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:34.460]   That will is Christ who said, "My food, my sustenance basically, the thing I live off
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.260]   is to do the will of my Father.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:42.980]   He already had coming down that preemptive heart, the condition and disposition.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.980]   I will do the Father's will, for that is my reward.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.100]   That's my work, that's my role, and that is my joy."
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.300]   That's the kind of heart we want to have.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:28:01.380]   So by summary of the first two points, essentially we have Apostle Paul who is laboring and striving,
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:07.540]   working so hard, sacrificing himself, investing himself so that what?
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.180]   We will be filled with the knowledge of God.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.620]   And I challenge you, seek it.
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.700]   Seek it and you will find.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.600]   That is the promise in the scripture.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.340]   Those who seek with all their heart, God will reveal.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.100]   I bank on that.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.140]   I bank on that.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.220]   Will it be a process?
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.740]   Will it take some time?
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.740]   Absolutely.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.900]   But we bank on that.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.300]   So that's the first part, or the first two points.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:35.740]   As we move down this passage though, I want to ask an obvious question.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.580]   One of these kind of like, you know, it's pretty clear in the passage but we have to
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.100]   ask it.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.140]   The question is why the knowledge of God in Christ?
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.500]   What do I mean by that?
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.820]   I could be praying and praying and praying, but I could be praying and praying and praying
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.540]   like for the unity of the church.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.260]   "My prayer for you day and night is for you to be united, for you to have harmony."
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.740]   Right?
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.340]   I could be praying and praying and praying that you be more loving people.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.140]   So Paul could have said, "I'm praying and sacrificing that you know love and you understand
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.140]   love."
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.140]   Right?
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:14.860]   But the question is, why specifically this idea of being filled with the knowledge of
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.860]   Christ?
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.300]   Again, perhaps something that's going to be obvious from the text, perhaps something that
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.380]   we've been reminded of before, but today is a day of motivation.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.980]   Today is a day of saying like, "Let's go with this.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.140]   Let's really strive for the knowledge of Christ.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.860]   Let's really not allow any hindrances.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.220]   Let's not be lazy.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.480]   Let's not be passive.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.420]   Let's not think that someone's going to do it for us, but let's go.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.700]   Let's study the word of God.
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.700]   Let's pray.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.700]   Let's ask.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.700]   Let's seek."
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.700]   Okay?
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   Why?
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.060]   Why the knowledge of God?
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:51.180]   Because if you think about it, concepts like love, concepts like harmony, concepts like
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:57.820]   peace, concepts even of your own spiritual well-being, they're all incomplete.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:03.540]   They're all incomplete and actually can be detrimental.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.220]   If what?
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.100]   If not in Christ.
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:12.220]   Because Christ is regularly told us in the scriptures, He is the all in all.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.820]   He is the fullness.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:18.260]   He is the collective, complete, like individual of God.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.540]   And therefore, if it's not in Christ, if that love is not in Christ, it's wrong.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.780]   It's not just, "It's deficient."
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:25.780]   It's wrong.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.860]   If that love, fellowship, community, peace, everything that we're seeking for, even spiritual
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.380]   well-being, if it's not in the perfection of Christ, it's wrong.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.420]   Let me give you an example.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:43.900]   If I want intimacy, but I want intimacy from anybody, absolutely sinful.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.940]   I need it where?
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.640]   That intimacy should be only found in the context of my covenant relationship and marriage.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.460]   If I want to have that companionship, if I want to enjoy whatever it may be, that are
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.100]   certain things reserved that God has given to us as good things and blessings, and yet
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:04.180]   I want it outside of the context of God's blessing and the fullness of how God has designed
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.180]   it.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.180]   It's wrong.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.020]   It's not just only a distraction.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.180]   It's not just only, "Oops, I missed the mark."
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.820]   It could be wrong.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.060]   So let's walk down this passage once more.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.580]   And what I would like for us to do is see the completeness of Christ.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:26.740]   See how categorically, thinking of the knowledge of Christ is categorically gigantic compared
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.660]   to you just wanting one facet, one blessing, one gift.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.660]   Okay?
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.780]   So categorically, Christ is the one who is truly complete, perfect, and therefore in
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.700]   Him we find everything.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.640]   In Him we find everything right.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.220]   And therefore, just as the scripture says, we have to do everything through Him, in Him,
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.220]   and by Him.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.820]   But let's take a look, starting from verse 13.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.900]   We left off earlier and read the passage.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.300]   Now we're starting in verse 13.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.700]   He says this, and again, I just want you to just take note.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.740]   Just take note and let's identify together all that is in Christ.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:05.180]   The perfections, the gifts, the glories that are in Christ.
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:10.740]   Verse 13, "For He rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us from the kingdom
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.380]   of His beloved Son."
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.620]   That's deliverance, friends.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:17.300]   "In whom we have redemption and forgiveness of sins."
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.380]   Bingo, we have two things there, redemption and forgiveness.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.180]   Verse 15, "He is the image of the invisible God."
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.260]   Whoa.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.140]   He just took it to another level.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:32.860]   Jesus Christ is in fact the image, the icon of God, the exact representation.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.780]   He is the firstborn of all things.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.080]   Not to say that He is the first created, that He is preeminent.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.980]   That He has the inheritance rights.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.100]   He has the privileges of the firstborn.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.780]   Verse 16, "For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:50.380]   and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:54.500]   All things have been created through Him and for Him.
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.980]   He is the creator."
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.220]   Verse 17, "He is before all things.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.220]   He is eternal."
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.420]   He says, "In Him all things hold together.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.580]   He's the sustainer."
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.580]   Verse 18, "He is also the head of the body, the church.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.500]   He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead so that He Himself will come to have,"
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.500]   what?
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.740]   "First place in everything.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.900]   For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him and through
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:21.900]   Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.260]   Through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:30.980]   And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind to engage in evil deeds, yet
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.340]   He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death in order to present you before
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.660]   Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.580]   If indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast and not moved away
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.720]   from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.340]   under heaven, of which I, Paul, was made a minister."
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.820]   That's a long passage.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:01.100]   But that long passage, in summary, says, "Look at how complete you will be in Christ.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.580]   Look at all the riches that are in Christ.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.220]   Look at all the glories that are in Christ."
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.220]   Amen?
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.540]   That's the passage.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.740]   And that is exactly what Apostle Paul is going to get at.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.460]   Apostle Paul is saying, "I have a heart for you.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.780]   I love you."
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.580]   What parent does not want what's best for their children?
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.340]   Parents will sacrifice all kinds of things for their children.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.180]   Parents won't even see it as a sacrifice when they give finances for what their children
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.180]   need.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.940]   And in that same way, just as every good parent wants their children to succeed, go through
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:37.900]   school and get a good education and have a good family, well, Apostle Paul is going to
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.100]   say, "I want you to succeed.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.300]   I want you to be complete.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.060]   I want you to be whole.
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:48.940]   And I'm going to give you the exact way I know how for you to be complete in Christ."
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.540]   And so that when you actually understand all that you have in Christ, you too, in natural
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.060]   response should be like, "Hallelujah!
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.060]   I'm rich!
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.340]   Look at all I have in Christ.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.340]   I'm complete in Christ.
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.420]   Everything that I'm looking for, all that I'm searching for is here."
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.860]   And that's why Apostle Paul and other pastors of Scripture, do you remember Ephesians chapter
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:16.820]   1, he will say, "Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord, who has blessed us with every
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.420]   spiritual blessing."
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.420]   Where?
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.420]   In the heavenly places.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.420]   In Christ.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.940]   In Christ, you've been blessed with every blessing you can think about.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.340]   In Christ, you have everything.
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.800]   Do you believe that?
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.680]   In Christ, you have all that you need and more.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.660]   But to tell you honestly, as I was going through these passages, I started thinking and thinking
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.040]   and then reflecting on my heart.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.820]   And I will confess right now, this is kind of like open confession, an open mic.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.820]   I'm just kidding.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.820]   All right.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.820]   Open confession.
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.060]   I see in myself this mixed bag of emotions.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.060]   Do I love Christ?
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.060]   Yes, I do.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.420]   Do I feel like I have all the blessings I have in Christ?
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.780]   Yes.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:01.420]   But at the same time, I feel a level of maybe like wanting, still needing, still desiring.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.060]   Maybe some of you feel the same way.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.060]   You feel levels of disappointment, still wanting more.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.180]   I have Christ, but I'm still looking for what I'm looking for.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.620]   And that's why so many people, especially the millennials are going out.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.660]   They say, "I have Christ, but I'm still trying to find my identity, still trying to find
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:17.660]   my purpose.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.140]   I'm still trying to find that thing which will satisfy."
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.100]   So they go out on discovery trips.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.340]   They go out trying to experience things, but they still don't understand you will not find
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.380]   it anywhere.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.580]   You're not going to have Christ plus something and then that will feel sufficient.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.060]   No, it's going to be Christ and nothing and you will be sufficient in the Lord because
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.620]   He is everything.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.780]   Because He is perfect.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.340]   He is the one who will give us the redemption we need, the forgiveness we need, the deliverance.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.860]   He is the creator, eternal sustainer.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.660]   He is everything to us.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.260]   And that's what we have to understand.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:01.960]   And so it is a bit sad, but I do feel a pervasive generational sentiment that they might claim
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.060]   the name of Christ, but they have this feeling of, "I still haven't found what I'm looking
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.060]   for."
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:12.820]   But what's more, if we really believe this, if we believe with the Apostle Paul that Christ
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:19.220]   is tremendously, categorically the greatest treasure of all, which Apostle Paul is going
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.900]   to get at, so I want to read it with us actually.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:26.020]   Please go back in your Bibles to Colossians chapter 1 verse 24.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:31.460]   And starting from 25, that section we're looking at, look at what he says, "Of this church
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:36.180]   I have been made a minister according to the stewardship from God, bestowed on me for your
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.020]   benefit so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God."
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.220]   So he's like, "I'm going to see this thing to the end.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.740]   I'm going to fulfill my ministry and I'm going to preach.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.840]   What am I preaching?
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.900]   It's this mystery that's been hidden from the past ages and generations that has been
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.500]   made manifest now to the saints.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.860]   Brothers and sisters, this is a glorious treasure, hidden treasure.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:04.140]   It's been hidden from ages and this is a unique privilege given to you."
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:10.020]   And then he says this, "To whom God willed to make known what is the what?
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.900]   Witches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles."
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.900]   Which is what?
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.220]   Which is Christ in you.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:20.380]   All that I've just described of Jesus, the one who gives you redemption, the one who
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:25.300]   gives you forgiveness, the one who is the creator, the one who is the sustainer, he
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.060]   is in you.
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.100]   He desires to dwell in you.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.820]   He desires to take place and have his presence in you, to move in you so much so the apostle
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:40.340]   Paul later on in Galatians chapter 2 will say, "I no longer live but Christ in me."
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.860]   He wants to be close, the God of the universe.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.700]   You're rich, you're filthy rich.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.580]   And yet again, as I go through this passage and I was doing my devotions, I was just so
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.580]   convicted.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:57.900]   It doesn't make sense the way I behave.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:03.980]   So rich and yet so difficult to let go of the trash of the world.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.620]   Have you guys seen those TV episodes of hoarders?
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.780]   It's kind of disgusting, right?
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:14.580]   These individuals who start mounting like newspaper, trash bags, like doggy biscuits,
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.580]   like everything.
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.900]   They just like mount it up in their house.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:22.020]   And I saw this one episode where this lady had pounded up so high, it blocked the front
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.180]   door and these people had to rescue her from her house.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.420]   They pulled her out through the window and once they started taking things out, they
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:34.620]   realized they had over like 10 tons of trash.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.700]   And you look at that and you're like, "Ew!"
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:42.300]   Because there's like rats everywhere and cockroaches and like everything is so disgusting.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:47.900]   Well, you know why I share that with you is because that's not so far from Christians
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:53.140]   who know better but cling so dearly, cling so dearly to the trash of this world.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.500]   If we truly believe we're rich in Christ, there should be a sentiment by which it's
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.060]   very easy to let go.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:04.020]   Now I understand in reality, in the way that we work on our hearts, it's not easy.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.820]   But if we believe Christ to be so valuable, it should be easy.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.220]   I'm going to reference another TV show.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.020]   Have you guys ever seen Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   Okay.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.020]   It's a good show.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.020]   Okay?
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.020]   Just kidding.
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.300]   It's just cheesy stuff.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.500]   Well, for those of you guys who don't know the young people here, it's a TV show, Will
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.220]   Smith, troublesome child, lives out in Philly.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.900]   He gets in trouble so he gets sent out to Uncle Phil.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.180]   Uncle Phil happens to be a judge and so he's really rich.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.300]   He has a butler named Jeffrey.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.500]   So Will, who's a troublesome child, decides to play a prank on Jeffrey.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.500]   What's the prank?
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.740]   He decides to make him think that he won the lottery by filming the previous week's lottery
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.740]   numbers.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.020]   So Jeffrey's sitting there watching and he realizes like, "Oh my gosh.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.820]   I just won the jackpot."
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.220]   And then all of a sudden, Jeffrey just changes.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:59.140]   And he looks over and he grabs this like fancy bottle and he just drops it.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.180]   And then all of a sudden, he goes on this like montage of like, "I quit.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.180]   I quit.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.180]   I quit.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.180]   I quit."
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.180]   He's just like jumping around like, "I quit.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.180]   I quit.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.180]   I quit."
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.260]   It's one of these kind of more funny and hilarious scenes that I saw on that TV show.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.580]   Why do I bring that up?
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.780]   Because that makes sense.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.300]   If you believe that instantaneously through your faith in Christ, you have been afforded
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:26.460]   an inherent sense with God, you have the maker and the power of the maker in you, you believe
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.740]   that this world has nothing to offer you beyond what Christ can offer you, and you actually
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:36.100]   believe that, you should be willing to say to the world, "I quit."
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.220]   It doesn't make sense for a butler to be like, "I know you guys boss me around.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.220]   I do your laundry.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.180]   I clean your dirty drawers and stuff.
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.860]   I won the jackpot, but I guess I'll have to stay."
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.140]   No, it doesn't make sense.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.820]   And that's what I'm challenging us with today.
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.980]   If we truly understand and appreciate the knowledge of Christ and we understand the
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:01.980]   completeness by which God has designed for us to find our sense of all of that identity,
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:08.500]   purpose, satisfaction in Christ, then that mentality will actually enable us to have
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.980]   victory over this world.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.980]   Amen?
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.940]   It will enable us to have that victory over this world.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.540]   Now the sad fact of the matter is we do seek for the plus.
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.580]   Oh, sorry.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.580]   The plus.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.780]   What I mean by the plus.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.540]   We do sometimes seek for Christ and the addition.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.740]   And what's really interesting is in this last week, I just wanted to talk about it because
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.740]   I was so inundated with this last week.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.660]   I had a conversation with somebody.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.820]   My wife had a conversation with somebody.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.020]   Some of my students had a conversation with somebody.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.740]   This generation is seeking for something a little bit outside of Christ, but still close
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.060]   to religion and church.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.700]   What I mean by that is this.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.820]   Very specifically, there is a generational move right now.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.780]   There is a movement going on right now called the New Apostolic Movement where there is
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:59.260]   a desire to experience the Word of God and an experience with God that is supernatural
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:04.800]   to the degree where an individual has come up to me and said, "You need to have a prophecy
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   from God.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.100]   Let me give you God's prophecy.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.100]   Have you heard the voice of God?"
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:15.460]   Now I'm going to say, "Yeah, every time I open this up, every word is the voice of God."
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.900]   But there has been movement to say, "You need to hear.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.100]   Has God spoken to you?
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.300]   Let me prophesy for you.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:26.500]   Let me give you this special knowledge God has given you."
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.740]   And in my mind, that is nothing more than exactly what the people of Colossae are struggling
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.740]   with.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:37.980]   The reason why Epaphras gave and went to visit Apostle Paul was because Colossae, the church,
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:43.600]   although they were striving, were being attacked by heresy, mysticism, Gnosticism.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.940]   You have to have the special knowledge we have to really experience God.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.060]   You have to have this special experience.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.580]   And so in this day and age, that stuff still exists.
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:59.180]   It's an age-old tactic of our enemy to make you think you need to have some kind of special
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.180]   experience.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.040]   Now you might not be verbally thinking that.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.220]   You might not be sitting there thinking, "Oh, I want God to audibly kind of like, I don't
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.500]   know, what's that guy's name?
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:13.560]   Gordon, you know, from Power Rangers, where his face like appears and says, "I'm speaking
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.000]   to you," you know?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.360]   Maybe you might not be personally wanting that.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:23.480]   But from confession of mouths of many people, I know that when people hit plateau and when
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.800]   they're stagnant, they want some kind of miracle to come.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.120]   They want some kind of experience.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.160]   They want some kind of special attention from God to work and stir them.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.480]   And that's why the things like the crazy end of the charismatic movement sometimes ends
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.840]   up being so popular, because what do they provide?
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.480]   Mystical experience.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:49.160]   And my admonition to you is here and now we learn there is going to be a sufficiency of
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.200]   knowing the person of Christ, and there is going to be no perfection and satisfaction
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:58.380]   in your life through mystical experience, but rather the intimate personal knowledge
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.380]   of Christ.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.380]   That's it.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:05.960]   There is something simplistic about Christianity, and that simplicity comes from a pure, loving
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:11.520]   faith in my Messiah, my Deliverer, my God.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.760]   Amen?
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.780]   It should be simplistic in that fashion.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:20.520]   And so I give that challenge to you, and now as we can start to conclude, I want to challenge
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.800]   you.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.760]   If you do believe this, that Christ is the greatest value of all, He is the hidden treasure,
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.960]   hidden from long ago, but now revealed to us.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.400]   Yes, the many Jewish people before, they had a veil, and they only saw in part, but now
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   it's been revealed, and you have the privilege of understanding all this.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:45.120]   If you believe this, you can't get away from the example of Paul, who was struck so deep
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.000]   with the grace of Christ.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.360]   He says, "I can do no other.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.520]   I am both bound by obligation, and it is my reward, it's my joy.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.520]   I am, yes, agonizing, and it's my joy.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.920]   I'm rejoicing in this."
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.780]   I want to see you complete in Christ.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:08.840]   So my admonition is this, many of us are struggling for myself, me, to be consistent, growing,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.480]   and loving Christ, but now the challenge is, not only are we to do that for ourselves,
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.080]   but the challenge is to have the heart of Apostle Paul, who says, "I want to see this
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.360]   in you."
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.520]   Every single individual in the church, so what does he say?
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.740]   Let's take a look at that last part of the passage, verse 28.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.480]   Chapter 1, verse 28.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:33.460]   Apostle Paul says this, he says, "We then proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:39.080]   every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ for this
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.080]   purpose."
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:45.520]   This purpose of presenting every man complete in Christ, he says, "I labor," and that word
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.000]   for labor is agonize.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.680]   "I agonize even to the degree of exhaustion."
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:55.320]   He says, "I'm striving according to his power, which mightily works within me."
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.400]   He's teaching, he's proclaiming, he's admonishing, rebuking, everything that he can do in the
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.320]   form of trying to disciple and teach.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.040]   "I will do for you."
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.520]   This is the greatest purpose Apostle Paul has attached to his life.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.080]   "I will exhaust myself to see you complete in Christ."
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.080]   Why?
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.040]   Because that is the greatest treasure of all.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.600]   "If I love you, that's what I'll do for you."
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.880]   Brothers and sisters, can I say this?
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.520]   It is not just the role of the pastor, the elders, the deacons, and people who are leaders
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.840]   and small group leaders to admonish, teach, and present every man complete.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:38.600]   Scripture, I'm not even going to give a specific risk because every single book of the Bible
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.960]   will say certain things to a certain thing as one.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.480]   Pray for each other, confess to each other, correct each other, admonish each other, speak
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.800]   truth to each other, sing psalms to each other.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:53.760]   The ministry of presenting one another complete in Christ is the ministry of us all collectively.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   Take a look at this.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   I want you to turn over to Ephesians chapter 4, verse 12 through 13.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:10.240]   Apostle Paul is going to say that God has so designed the church to fulfill this purpose,
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:16.080]   to be complete in Christ, that every single member would rise from the low standard that
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.600]   perhaps sometimes we have to the standard of God.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.760]   In Ephesians chapter 4, verse 12, it says this, "And he gave some as apostles, some
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.360]   as prophets, some as evangelists, some as pastors, some as teachers for the equipping
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:34.760]   of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ until we
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:40.880]   all attain the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature manhood, to
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.240]   the measure and stature which belong to the fullness of Christ."
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.640]   Brothers and sisters, this is our philosophy of the ministry.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.440]   We are not simply okay that you sign off on a piece of paper and say, "I'm a member,"
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.900]   and then you just coast.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.800]   We are not okay with that.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   God is not okay with that.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.880]   Apostle Paul would never be okay with that.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.080]   Our Savior Jesus Christ would not be okay with that.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.560]   God wants us to mature in every increasing fashion.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.800]   God wants us to grow step by step from stature to stature.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.960]   God wants you to strive for more even beyond what you think is possible because yes, it's
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.840]   true, if with you it's not possible, but with God, he will transform you, and that's
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.400]   the confidence I have to do the work I do.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.120]   Truthfully speaking, there are moments when ministry is tough and it's frustrating.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.440]   There are Christians who should know better.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.720]   I've been a Christian for 10 years, and I just feel like, "Dude, man, you should
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.120]   know better."
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.800]   There are times when people are just resistant.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.640]   There are times when people, they have weak will.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.160]   They're like, "Yes, yes, I would like to, but I can't."
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.800]   There are times the way we think, and it's just all over the place.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.120]   Sometimes we just are stubborn.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.940]   Sometimes we're just unwilling to see.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.280]   Sometimes we make excuses.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.780]   So many things in terms of the stuff that goes in our minds hinder growing in faith
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.600]   and knowledge, right?
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.040]   But I take this as a level of confidence.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:08.400]   If it was predicated on my know-how to counsel and disciple you, then yes, none of this would
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.400]   work.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:14.160]   However, we are being taught today and being motivated, but Christ is truly the fullness
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.160]   of everything.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.040]   He is the revelation of mystery, and once more, the various passages that we looked
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.500]   at, it says, "He is the wisdom of God.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:27.120]   He is the perfection of God's truth, and therefore, God can perfect all of you.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.480]   God can radically perform the sinner who is unwilling to bend.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.600]   God can transform our stubborn hearts.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.040]   God can transform if you guys struggle with imagination, fantasy, and controlling your
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.040]   thoughts.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.520]   God through Christ can transform you, amen?
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.720]   I take that as a huge level of confidence to do ministry.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.600]   All the counseling is not a lost investment.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.000]   All the time sitting and praying together, all the time looking at the scripture, none
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.080]   of that is a lost cause.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   Why?
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:01.200]   Because my perfect Christ can perfect all of us, amen?
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.880]   That's where the confidence lies, and so Apostle Paul says, "For that purpose, I struggle.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:10.920]   For that purpose, I strive and I labor and I beat myself up almost."
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:16.100]   We began this sermon by talking about worthy causes we shouldn't give up, worthy causes
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:20.640]   we shouldn't just let go by the wayside because we have other higher priorities or because
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.400]   we just feel like we don't have the confidence or just because we feel like we lost motivation.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:32.000]   Here and now, Apostle Paul is teaching us worthy causes, seeking completeness in Christ,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.320]   and then seeking the completeness of brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:41.880]   Can I share with you personally a little bit here?
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:46.160]   The last couple of months have been really busy, and I just want to thank all of you
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.480]   because truthfully speaking, I have felt incredibly encouraged being at our church.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.800]   Through some of the craziest times of our church, like literally the craziest times
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:00.960]   of our church, I really felt like, "Man, the church is together and we were striving."
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.560]   I also thank you guys because some of you guys have come up to me and said, "Man, Pastor
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.800]   Mark, you're kind of doing too much."
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   I understand what you're saying, so thank you for considering me.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.840]   Thank you for considering the elders.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.640]   Thank you for considering Pastor Peter.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.080]   Some of you have gone even overboard and been like, "Hey, you're doing too much.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   You need a dogging."
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   For speaking truth to me, thank you.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:26.160]   Personally sometimes I bought off way more than I can chew, and I do need a delegate,
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.800]   and I do need to trust other brothers and sisters to do the work and all that kind of
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.200]   stuff.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:37.880]   However, we all understand too that here and now, as I was looking at what Apostle Paul
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.240]   was trying to say, I felt so just inspired.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:47.400]   He is agonizing and struggling to see the church complete in Christ.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.600]   To that end, I never want to have an attitude.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.240]   I never want to end the day of doing church ministry, of working with people and meeting
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.840]   with them and say, "Maybe I just did too much today."
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.600]   No, that is not the right attitude.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.960]   I have in my heart a desire to do even more.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.080]   I have in my heart a desire to not quit.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.200]   I never want to retire.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.200]   I never want to give up.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:11.480]   I never want to have this attitude before God, "God, I just have too much."
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:17.280]   Because these are things so worthy that probably it is the right scenario that all of us feel
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:23.400]   a level of struggling and combating and laboring and agonizing to see our brothers and sisters
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.720]   and the ones we love, our church, collectively complete in Christ.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   Amen?
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.800]   I hope the words of God today in this passage, chapter 1 and 2 of Colossians, inspired and
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:39.120]   challenge you to keep persevering and never give up on that which you already know.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.520]   Let's seek Christ with all our hearts and let's make sure our brothers are doing the
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.520]   same.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.520]   Amen?
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.520]   Let's pray.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:52.480]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much for the exhortation and challenge today.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:57.800]   God, we thank you so much because you're so patient and gracious with us and you keep
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.200]   giving us truth and guidance.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   And then it's our prayer.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   Lord, we want it.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:06.360]   We want to hear from you and we want your help to make sure that we make the effective
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.480]   change in our lives and we want your help to really walk with perseverance.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.320]   And we want to grow in the knowledge of Christ, Lord.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:18.560]   We want to know him more, to be intimate with him, to understand his heart because truly,
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.760]   Lord, that is what is to us our reward and what's sweet.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:27.520]   Father, I ask that you would help us though because we confess there are many distractions.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.440]   We see our weakness.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:34.300]   We see sometimes our sin combat that path and that desire.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:38.400]   So God, would you work in our hearts through your spirit to make sure that those hurdles
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:43.200]   are overcome and God, that we might live a life truly that is pleasing unto you.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.240]   Father, we thank you and devote this time to you.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.960]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.960]   Amen.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.440]   Let's take some time to pray.
