[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   We're going to be looking at verses 5 through 7, but we'll be reading from 5 through 11
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.640]   this morning.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.600]   Sorry, we'll be reading from verse 1 all the way through verse 11.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   What shall we say then?
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.060]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.060]   By no means.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.040]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.640]   Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.920]   his death?
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.820]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.400]   raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in a newness of life.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.480]   For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.660]   him in a resurrection like his.
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.240]   We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.680]   brought to nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.920]   For one who has died has been set free from sin.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.140]   Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.580]   We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again.
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.720]   Death no longer has dominion over him.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.480]   For the death he died, he died to sin once for all.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.360]   But the life he lives, he lives to God.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.520]   So you also must consider yourself dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.920]   Let's pray.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.080]   Heavenly Father, we entrust this time to you, asking Lord God that we would be able to redeem
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.320]   this time for our sanctification, for the glorification of your name, for praise and
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.800]   honor and worship that you are due.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.340]   We thank you Lord for being patient with us.
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.640]   We thank you for forgiveness in Christ.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.680]   We pray Father God that your word would convict, renew, strengthen, and encourage, that you
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.520]   would ordain this time for the sake of the growth of your church.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.480]   We ask Lord the Holy Spirit would give us eager ears, soft hearts, and a willingness
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.640]   Lord God to not only to hear but to apply all that you have.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.600]   In Jesus name we pray, Amen.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.780]   You know one of the most sobering passages in the New Testament, I think it's found in
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.680]   Matthew 7, 21 and on, where it says, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.560]   enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.720]   Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.120]   Now that is stated in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, talking about what the kingdom of heaven
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.960]   is going to look like.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.720]   He's describing to a group of people who are actively participating in the synagogue, in
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.160]   the temple.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.200]   So the people that he is addressing would be equivalent to people who are raised in
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.960]   the church.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.560]   People who are very active in the church.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.960]   People who are attending Sunday services.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.200]   It would be equivalent to people, some of them, very active and even proselytizing.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.660]   Even going out to short term missions.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.840]   Even leading in small group Bible study.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.600]   Leading worship.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.320]   And even pastors.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.560]   His audience were not pagan worshippers.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.520]   They weren't idolaters, at least the way that we would consider idolaters.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.560]   He goes on even further and he says, verse 23, "And then I will declare to them, 'I never
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.040]   knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.160]   I remember the first time as a young Christian reading this passage and it really shook me
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   up.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   How am I confident that this is not me?
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.200]   How can I just automatically read this passage and say, "Well, I feel bad for those people."
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.040]   Because Jesus is speaking to church people.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.640]   Again, church the way we know it has not established at that point, but those are his people.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.400]   These are people who are active in synagogue.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.840]   These are people who have been circumcised, who have been raided, maybe even memorized
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.640]   large chunks of the Torah.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.120]   And yet he says, "I never knew you.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.520]   All of that had nothing to do with me."
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.040]   So as I was reading this, how do I know that this isn't talking about me?
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.960]   As a pastor's kid, I know some of you guys are also PKs, I was raised in a pastor's family
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.020]   and my grandfather was a pastor.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.040]   So I was very cultured in Christianity.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.840]   I can't remember a single Sunday that our family did not attend church.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.080]   I have very fond memories of church when I was very young.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.960]   It wasn't until I was maybe in the fifth or sixth grade, I began to notice some of the
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.320]   hypocrisy in the church.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.520]   Many times, sitting in the back of the car while my parents are coming back from church
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.640]   and they would talk about all the things that they're frustrated in.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.600]   So I was able to hear and see all that was going on behind the curtains.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.640]   You can see like at the church, everybody puts on a good face, but then all the things
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.960]   that people are frustrated with and all the complaints that they have and the human relational
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   issues.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.040]   And I would hear all of that from behind the scene.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.120]   And before I became a Christian, I always wondered why these people come to church if
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.300]   they hate each other that much, because that's what it seems like.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.640]   They just can't come to agreement and they don't like each other, but then they come
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   and they worship and then they come and they...
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.560]   I mean, to me, it looks so fake, even as a kid.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.280]   Why do they come to church?
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.840]   And I remember, even from a young age, thinking to myself that once I turn 18 and I'm independent,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.560]   I'm not going to church.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.080]   I couldn't do it before then because my dad was a pastor and it would be very shameful
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.240]   for the pastor's kid to decide not to come to church.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.320]   So I thought maybe when I'm old enough and I'm no longer under his roof and I could just
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.880]   leave the church and it would be fine.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.920]   So I determined, even from a young age, I think as early as fifth grade, I told myself
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   I'm not going to church.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.360]   This is not me.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.120]   I've seen behind the scene, because my dad was a pastor of a large church out in Korea.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.360]   He was also a pastor of a very small church here, many times.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.880]   He was also a seminary professor, so he had a lot of connections.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.120]   And so I've seen a lot of things.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.920]   I think many of you who grew up in the church, if I was to ask you some of your experiences,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.680]   you probably have your own stories.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.760]   But again, being a pastor's kid, I was privileged to be able to see a lot of things.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.040]   Of course, there's a lot of non-Christians in the church, and I've seen that.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.640]   But that's not where the real things that disturbed me, and maybe it disturbed you.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.480]   I've seen deacons get into fistfights in the church, and I know I'm giving very extreme
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.960]   cases, and I always wondered to myself why they were in the church.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.800]   But that's not where it stopped.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.520]   I've seen elders who are ordained in the church, and then I would go, because that particular
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.680]   elder who got ordained, his child was a good friend of mine, so I would always hang out
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.560]   at their church, at their house after the church.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.800]   And I remember attending the ordination meeting, and then afterwards, he would invite all of
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.160]   his friends, and they had a big drinking party at the house.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.600]   And I remember just watching that, just sitting and watching that, thinking, "What is going
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.880]   on here?"
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.360]   But that's not where it ends.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.520]   I remember even after I became a pastor, as a young pastor at a church and watching an
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.800]   older pastor constantly angry that he wasn't respected in the church, and I remember him
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.360]   getting into a fight with somebody because he said that he was the number two at church.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.200]   There was about six or seven pastors, and we had the head pastor, and then he was the
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.400]   number two at the church, and so that number two parking space was his.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.600]   First one was the senior pastor, and he can't challenge that, but the second one was his,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.840]   so anybody that parked there, he would come in huffing and puffing, "Who parked there?"
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.120]   And he would demand, and I remember watching, it wasn't just that incident, I was just watching,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.120]   thinking, "How did that man get ordained?"
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.920]   One of the things that disturbed me the most was when I had an opportunity to chauffeur
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.480]   around a nationally known speaker, and again, he's in a Korean church, and so he was invited
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:04.280]   to speak at my father's church, and I was assigned the job to pick him up and take him
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.480]   to church, and whatever he needed, I became the chauffeur.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.200]   By that time, I was already a young pastor, and so I volunteered to do it, and I thought
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.040]   it'd be great to spend some time with a nationally known speaker, and so the whole time that
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.440]   I was with him, I heard, again, behind the scene with him, arguing with the elders of
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.600]   the church about how he was so disappointed that they didn't give him the best room, that
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.440]   they gave him a cheaper room, because again, the church at that time was a very small church,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.120]   and that he deserved to be in the embassy suite, and he talked about how demanded that
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:42.400]   the offering that was collected during the revival was his, because he's the reason why
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   people came, so whatever the offering that they gave, it belonged to him, so I'm driving
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.280]   him around, I'm hearing this all the time, you know, in the background, I'm thinking,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.240]   wow, this is a man that's going around speaking all over the country, and all over these churches,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.720]   and I sat through all of his preaching, he's a great preacher, great preacher, after he
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.960]   would speak, he would invite people to come, he would lay hands on them, people would be
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:13.720]   in tears, people would be in tears thanking him for his sermons, and me the whole time
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.200]   thinking like, wow, that's the guy, nobody knows what's going on behind the scene, and
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.680]   I began to think to myself, I wonder how much of Christianity is that, you know, we've created
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.920]   this facade, we've created this religious institution, where if we play the part and
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.360]   do the right things, and yet behind the curtain, behind the curtain, we're no more transformed
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:45.640]   than the world, in fact, it's probably even worse, because we're faking it, we're pretending
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:51.400]   to be righteous, and yet behind the curtains, we're no different, now why am I sharing all
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:59.200]   of this, because the concern that the readers of Paul's letter had with Paul, saying, salvation
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.560]   is by justification, by faith, by grace alone, so some of them were thinking, if that's what
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.200]   salvation is, don't you think that's going to lead to lawlessness, if you're saying that
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.760]   all law does is reveal sin, but it has no way of saving you, wouldn't that cause a bunch
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:22.520]   of people to just say, one saved always saved, it doesn't matter what you do, because it's
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.560]   not what I did, but what he did, I mean, people are just using these cliches to cover over
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:34.120]   their sin, and to be honest, let's be honest, it does superficially, if you tell a group
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:42.280]   of people, what you do doesn't matter, wouldn't that create some of this stuff, the honest
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.720]   answer, we have to be honest with ourselves, if we're not careful, it does, when you're
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.480]   not preaching the full gospel, and you're only preaching superficially, that if you
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.680]   wave your hands, and if you feel something inside, that you've been saved for eternity,
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.000]   so from that moment on, whatever sin that you are allowed to continue to harbor in your
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.640]   life, it doesn't matter, because you're saved, because we're saved by grace, and grace alone,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:16.040]   Paul is saying, by no means, by no means, absolutely not, not only does it not lead
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.080]   to licentiousness, not only does it not lead to lawlessness, it actually leads to a transformed
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:28.280]   life, that looks nothing like this world, so the question is, how come that's not what
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.600]   we see, what is actually happening, is Paul just laying out a bunch of theories, that
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:42.040]   doesn't actually work, or is he actually telling us, that this is what true life looks like,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.320]   and obviously, that's where Paul's case that he's making, he's talking about the latter,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:55.240]   see, what Paul says here is, an individual who has genuinely repented, genuinely repented,
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.120]   genuinely been justified by faith, and by grace alone, the very first thing that happens
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.680]   is he is united with Christ, remember we talked about that, he uses the term baptism, you
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.360]   know, last week we talked about that, baptism in our mind is talking about this religious
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   ceremony, but the word itself means to be immersed, that our salvation is described
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:22.320]   as an intimate union with Christ, and that's why the Bible describes our relationship with
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:28.200]   him as a bride, we are the bride, and he is the groom, so any of you who've been married,
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.520]   or been to a wedding ceremony, you know, one of the traditions that they have, is you have
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.920]   two lights that are flickering, until they're ready, and after they make the vow, they come,
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.560]   what do they do, they turn off those lights, and then they turn one on, meaning, it is
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:47.600]   no longer two people, but they become one, so from that moment on, you have to think
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.400]   like one person, you're going to share the same money, you're going to share the same
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.760]   time, you're going to share the same space, imagine if you came in, they never turned
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:05.320]   off that light, and said we're going to stay individual, we're going to be in the house,
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.960]   but we're not really going to be united on paper for tax purposes, but they're not truly
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.760]   united, the Bible says an individual who has repented of his sins, and was forgiven, was
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.440]   justified by faith and grace alone, we have become the bride of Christ, in fact, the illustration
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.520]   goes even further, we have become the temple of the Holy Spirit, this is where he dwells,
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.100]   he goes even further than that, and he calls us the body of Christ, that he is the head,
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.320]   and just like I can never say, you know, that's my hand, that has nothing to do with me, the
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:44.700]   hand, my feet, every part of my body parts, are also mine, so when the Bible describes
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.280]   all of us, members of the body of Christ, it's talking about this intimate union with
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:57.100]   Christ, not just a momentary union, not just a holding of hands, we have been immersed
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:03.080]   with Christ, in fact, the Bible describes our immersion as so intimate, that we are
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.760]   to smell like Christ, you're probably thinking in your head, what does it say, you're supposed
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:14.080]   to smell like Christ, you ever see a couple who's been married for a long time, they actually
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:19.760]   begin to smell alike, because they eat the same food, you know, they sleep on the same
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:27.920]   bed, your clothes are washed by the same soap, and so if you've been married for a long time,
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:35.120]   you start to actually smell alike, right, good and bad, right, depending, well the Bible
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.280]   says that we have been united with Christ in such a way, in 2 Corinthians 2, verse 15,
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:46.080]   it says, we are the aroma of Christ, we are the smell of Christ among those who are being
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:54.160]   saved and among those who are perishing, that our union with Christ is so intense, so complete,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:01.520]   that we actually become the smell of Christ wherever we go, so in this union, Paul says,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:10.720]   the first thing that happens in this union is we die, we are baptized into his death,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.840]   you know what's interesting in verse 4, that Paul, to make sure that you understand this
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.000]   illustration of death, he goes even further, he doesn't just say you died with Christ,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.440]   he says we were buried therefore with him in baptism, we were buried with him, just
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.120]   in case that you thought that the death was just kind of a side thing that just happened,
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.880]   he said he wants to make sure that no, you didn't just die, you were buried, if any of
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.600]   you have ever participated, and I'm not talking about just going to a funeral, but you have
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.920]   to prepare the funeral, you have to get the casket, you have to make sure that the cemetery,
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.040]   the burial site was ready, and you have to pay for all of that, if any of you had to
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.560]   participate in all of that, I think some of you guys may know what I'm talking about,
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.880]   when my father passed away, me and my brothers obviously had to prepare all of that, and
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.120]   it definitely is a business, you know, they're trying to comfort you, and the people who
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.520]   are in this business, the mortuary, the cemeteries, and all of this, but they want to, you know,
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.200]   say hey, this is the last thing you want to do for your father, you want to make sure
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:18.480]   you want to spend $300 on a piece of trash, versus this $7000, you know what I mean, and
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.240]   you feel guilty, like this is the last thing I'm doing for my father, you know, but one
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:29.160]   thing that really disturbed me was that when we were getting all this ready, and they had
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:36.280]   this extra charge, and it's at the burial site, and they say, if you don't pay extra
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:43.560]   $700, you have to leave your father's casket on top of that stand, and go home.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:50.240]   And I said, if you want them to come and actually lower that into the grave, and then have the
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.600]   dirt pouring ceremony, that will cost you extra $700.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.480]   So I'm like, what?
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.360]   Who would feel comfortable just leaving?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   Because it's not complete.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.800]   Now obviously, you know, your logic is going to tell you, of course they're going to bury
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.200]   him.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   But in our mind, it's not closed.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.000]   Emotionally, it's not complete until he's actually in the ground, and we have to pour
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   dirt on it.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.240]   And they say, well, it's just their policy, it's $700 extra.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.640]   Well, they're going to do it, but if they do it when you're there, it's $700.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.000]   If they do it after you leave, you don't have to pay the $700.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.160]   I was like, oh my gosh.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.120]   I was about to like, what is wrong with you?
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:38.480]   And then, we were kind of going back and forth, and then one of the guys who was working at
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.040]   Mortuary, he does this for a living, and he said, hey, hey, pull this aside.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   You don't have to do that.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.040]   And he pulled this aside and says, just get a bunch of $20 bills, maybe about five of
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:53.000]   them, and see the workers, those guys who are just standing around, and they're waiting
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   for us to leave.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.320]   Just slip them $20 each before it starts, and say, hey, do you mind when we're done,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.320]   can you just kind of come and just lower it for us?
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.480]   And they said, instead of doing it at $700, you give them $100 and you do it.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.600]   So being Korean, I did it.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:16.160]   So I went around and slipped all the money, and then so they came and did it.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.080]   It's like, yes, suckers.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.760]   I saved $600.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:26.200]   But any of you who participated in that whole process, it's kind of like, yeah, you don't
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.960]   feel, even though his life is no longer in that body, it's in the casket, but you don't
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.920]   feel like it's absolutely complete until it is buried.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:37.320]   And that's the imagery that is used by Paul, and he said, not only have we been crucified,
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.200]   Jesus was buried and the tomb was shut.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.840]   It was complete.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.640]   The death was absolutely final, and that's the description that he uses.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.000]   When we were united with Christ, we were complete.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.480]   We have been crucified with Christ.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.080]   It is no longer us who live.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:04.720]   See, that discussion that we have constantly, what should I do with my life, is a very unfruitful
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   discussion.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.200]   In fact, we would go even further and say it is an unbiblical discussion.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.400]   Because the Bible says we have been crucified with Christ, and yet we're constantly concerned
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.960]   about what should I do with my life.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.400]   That's just like saying, you know what, the Bible says I'm crucified, but I'm going to
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.960]   live like this if I'm not.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.400]   And then we wonder why we're so frustrated.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.440]   See, what Paul is describing is what happened.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.760]   See, when somebody repents, he didn't just repent and say, you know what, I repent of
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.320]   certain events, certain things that I did in my life.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.200]   The repentance is that I was wrong about all of this.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.600]   I repented of my life, what I thought was good, what I thought was rest, what I thought
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:56.360]   was hope, what I thought was insurance, all of that was wrong.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.160]   And we repented of it.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.900]   And we were crucified.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.680]   And we became new creatures.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.920]   What exactly happened?
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:10.080]   He goes on in verse 6, and he says, "We know that our old self was crucified," number one,
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.360]   "with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing," number two, "so that
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:20.000]   we should no longer be enslaved to sin," number three.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.920]   He said three specific things happened when we were buried with him in baptism.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.800]   One is that our old self was crucified with him.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.440]   He's not just talking about a certain aspect of your life.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.820]   He's not talking about just your career.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:42.000]   He said our old self, everything that I was before I met Christ was also crucified and
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.840]   buried.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.440]   I became a completely new creation.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.680]   Again, Ephesians 4, 20, it says, "But that is not the way you learned Christ, assuming
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.420]   that you have heard about him and were taught in him as the truth is in Jesus, to put off
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:02.240]   your old self, which belongs to your old former manner of life."
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.360]   Whatever it was that we held onto before we met Christ was no longer relevant.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.720]   In fact, some of the things that we held onto, we're thinking that somehow we can use that
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   for the glory of God, sometimes become the greatest hindrance.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.400]   Sometimes those of you who are smart with position, with honor and money, and we think
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.520]   that we know that can naturally translate into greater work for the kingdom of God,
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.960]   but those are the things sometimes that causes the greatest stumbling in your life, because
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.640]   it's your source of pride, thinking that somehow you're going to add.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.600]   So the very first thing that happens when we meet Christ and when we're genuinely justified
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:48.320]   by faith and by grace is all that I was prior to meeting Christ dies and is buried with
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.320]   Christ.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.920]   There was nothing to salvage.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.120]   There's nothing to salvage.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.600]   And he creates a very new creation.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.240]   As Christ is resurrected in his new life, we are resurrected along with him in a new
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.640]   life.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.400]   It is being in between, holding onto the past and wanting the future that is causing the
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   frustration.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.880]   Again, in Colossians 3, 9-10, he said, "Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:19.520]   put off the old self with its practices, and you have put on the new self."
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.120]   You notice here that Paul is not telling them that this is what you do?
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.920]   He said, "Do not realize that this is what happened."
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.360]   He's talking about indicative.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.520]   He's talking about theology.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:35.240]   He's saying, "This is what happened to you."
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:40.080]   When two people get married, during the pronouncement, we always read a passage in Mark 10, 7 and
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.080]   8.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.000]   We said, "For this reason, man will leave his father and mother and be united to his
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.580]   wife, and the two will become one flesh so that they are no longer two, but one."
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.120]   We call that leaving and cleaving.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.200]   Again, illustrated by the two candles.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.720]   The representative of the two families come, and they will light the candle, and they will
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.200]   sit down, and then after the vows, they will go and blow off the candles, and they will
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.520]   unite to one.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.740]   So in order for the one candle to be lit, the other two had to be turned off.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.000]   We call that leaving and cleaving.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   So when we are united with Christ, the Bible says what happened is you left your old life.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.600]   Whatever it is that you were united to before you met Christ is no longer relevant, nothing
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:30.280]   to salvage, and you have now brought into this situation a newness.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:42.680]   You know, some of you guys who are cat lovers, before you met Christ, cat was your love.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.620]   Or before you met your husband or wife or whoever, right?
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.560]   But if your husband or wife is allergic to a cat, you have a decision to make.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.240]   You have a decision to make.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.520]   Do I love this cat more than my husband?
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.040]   Do I love this more than my wife?
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.840]   Or say, "Well, I want both."
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.080]   Well, you can't have both.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.560]   Because your husband can't be in the same room as that cat.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.080]   As long as that cat is in the house, the husband is going to be miserable, and not just momentarily,
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.680]   for the rest of his life.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.240]   So you have a decision to make.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:23.120]   You choose between the cat or your husband, or future husband.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   Or say, "You know, I don't want him.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.680]   I love my cat better," and just walk away.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.160]   Live with your cat.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.760]   But you cannot do both.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:40.800]   See, what Jesus is describing is when the gospel of Jesus Christ was proclaimed, and
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.920]   your eyes became open, the reason why you confessed and was forgiven is because you
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:52.160]   saw that and said, "I want that more than the cat."
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.360]   I don't know why I loved the cat in the first place.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.000]   All that cat does is take my money, poops on the floor.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.560]   I mean, it's not loyal.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.560]   It constantly runs.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.400]   I don't know why I was so hooked on that cat in the first place.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.080]   I want Jesus.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.200]   That's why you repented.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.920]   That's why we turned away from sin, and we embraced Christ.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.600]   So what Paul is saying, he's going to get to the imperative.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.640]   He's going to say, "Therefore, this is what you ought to do."
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.880]   But before he gets to the "therefore," he's trying to explain why true salvation does
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.320]   not lead to lawlessness.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.360]   True repentance does not lead to licentiousness.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.600]   In fact, it leads to greater life in Christ.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:49.400]   When the two people became married, all of the Old Testament is to teach that God cannot
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.320]   be in the presence of sin.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.000]   That was the whole teaching in the Old Testament, the whole point of the tabernacle, even with
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.320]   His own chosen people.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.960]   He said, "If I go with these stiff-necked people, I may become angry and destroy all
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.160]   of them."
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.800]   And any of them, even the high priest that approaches God, had to make these elaborate
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.320]   sacrifices to cover him temporarily so that he would not be destroyed by the holiness
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.040]   of God.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.240]   We come to the New Testament, and he says, "No, that holiness now makes His dwelling
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.520]   in us."
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.240]   And so an individual who repents of his sin and is united with Christ can no longer allow
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.440]   the sin to live with them.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.120]   Does a cat every once in a while jump into the room?
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   Does somebody else who loves cats and have a cat with them all the time happen to come
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.600]   over to your house every once in a while?
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.520]   But that cat can't live with you.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.920]   That cat cannot be your pet.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.640]   That's what he's describing when he says when somebody has genuinely repented, they have
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.280]   repented from their old way of life.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.000]   The old self has been put off, and they put on the new self.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.800]   The body of sin, he says, secondly, that it may be brought to nothing.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.120]   NASB says the body of sin might be done away with completely.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.720]   King James says that the body of sin may be destroyed, but the literal translation, literal
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.480]   understanding of this in the Greek dictionary says this.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:27.840]   It means to render inactive, idle, useless, and ineffective.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.120]   I know some of you guys may be sitting here thinking like, "Hmm, that's not how it feels."
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.040]   When we read Romans chapter 7, it says, "What I want to do, I don't do.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.480]   What I don't want to do, I keep on doing.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.840]   Oh, what a wretched man I am, and I feel like that's me."
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.480]   But here it says it's rendered useless, ineffective.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.880]   How come I don't feel it?
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.000]   Let me give you an example of what Paul means here as an indicative, as what happened to
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.240]   us.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.680]   I had a friend who came to the United States in his mid to late junior high school from
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.280]   Korea, and he lived in K-town, so you don't have to speak English in K-town.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.360]   So for 10 years, he's going to Korean Bible studies, singing Korean songs, and doing everything
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.920]   Korean, and even after 10 years, we would go to a restaurant, and he just would not
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   order.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   He would say, "Peter, you order."
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.160]   I mean, his English, in my opinion, was good, but he just refused to speak.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.080]   And he never let go of his Korean citizenship.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.600]   He had every intent, all of his family, friends, everybody he knew was in the United States,
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:30.440]   but he never forfeited his citizenship, because U.S. allows dual citizenship.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.000]   So he always allowed it, and then in his late 20s, he happened to revisit Korea, and then
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.360]   when he got there, he got caught on the way out, because Korea has mandatory military
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.040]   service.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.720]   And usually between the age of 18 and mid-20s, they get drafted, they're in there for two
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.480]   to three years, depending.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:54.200]   And so on the way out, he got caught, and he was forced into the military, Korean military.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:00.760]   And so in his late 20s, he became a private, and he had a hard time, because he had 18,
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.500]   19, 20-year-olds yelling at him.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.840]   And that's hard for any culture, but in Korean culture, it's impossible, you know what I
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   mean?
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.440]   That's the hierarchy that Korean culture has, and he was miserable, because these guys were
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.440]   seven, eight years younger than him, ordering him to get out of bed, doing this.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.440]   He was miserable.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:23.160]   And even after he came out of the military, he just was so difficult, he just couldn't
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.680]   adjust to America, and then he ended up just settling down, and had kids there, and he
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:34.320]   just ended up going back, because it was easier for him to stay over there.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:40.200]   And the Bible describes our position before God.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.640]   And he says that sin no longer has any dominion over us.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.000]   He says that our citizenship in the old life has been canceled.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.800]   And in Colossians 1, 13-14, it says, "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.060]   transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.060]   of sin."
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.260]   We're trying so hard to have dual citizenship, and we want to hold on to our old form of
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.340]   life and have Christ too, and then that's causing all kinds of frustrations in your
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.340]   life.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:14.500]   Thinking that if you can somehow tweak this and tweak that, and if we do this, and not
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:21.460]   recognizing, the core of the problem is you can't have dual citizenship in the kingdom.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.580]   And again, Paul's not talking about imperatives here, he's going to challenge them, "Therefore
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.140]   now you ought to do this."
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:32.420]   But right now, he's just describing, "This is what happened."
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:38.540]   If you are a genuine believer, if you genuinely repented and have been renewed, you are a
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.540]   new creation.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:48.380]   Not just theoretically, not just theologically, but this happened.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:56.020]   The longer you look back and hold on to that, the more frustrated your life will be.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.700]   He says ultimately, the final reason why he says what happened in our union with Christ
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:07.460]   and his death is to our old self to be crucified, the body of sin to be brought to nothing,
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:12.140]   ineffective in our lives, and its ultimate accomplishment is to set us free.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.140]   To set us free.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.620]   In Romans 6, verse 14, "For sin will have no dominion over you."
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.780]   You have no dominion over you.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:25.020]   John 8, verse 34, "Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:30.580]   sin, everyone who continues sin, everyone who allows this cat to be their pet in their
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.300]   home, commits sin, is a slave to sin.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:40.540]   The slave does not remain in the house forever, the son remains forever.'"
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.160]   You notice what he said?
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.260]   If you're still enslaved to sin, you won't remain forever.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.780]   Isn't that what it says in 1 John?
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:55.140]   They left because they were never really of us.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:01.900]   Slaves who are pretending will come and live in the house for a period to benefit.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.840]   But if he's not a son, that's not his house.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.100]   So therefore they will remain for a period, but eventually they will get out of the house.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:15.260]   "Only the son will remain forever."
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:21.100]   And then he says, "So if the son sets you free, you will be free indeed."
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:29.580]   So our first act of union with Christ is being united with Him in death and burial.
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.100]   We're done.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.020]   Our old self before we met Christ is done.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.240]   That is no longer us.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.780]   He didn't just cancel our sins.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:50.820]   Imagine if somebody committed a horrendous crime and he comes to the judge and he says,
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.820]   "You know what?
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.740]   Instead of him being beaten, I will be beaten."
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.140]   And then the judge gets beaten and then the guy just walks out.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:04.260]   Now how many times do we hear that illustration and we say, "Wow, Jesus did that for us."
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.520]   Imagine if you're the guy who got beaten.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.080]   This guy perpetrated, came into your house, beat your kids and beat your wife.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   He went to the court and then the judge says, "I will take the beating."
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.520]   And then he just walked out.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.620]   How many of you will praise the judge?
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.660]   That judge is so gracious.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.700]   He's so loving.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.400]   How many of you would think that?
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.680]   Most of you will think that's unjust.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.560]   How can that guy get away with that?
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.000]   But that's not what happened.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.040]   We often celebrate the judge being beaten and this sinner, exactly the way he is, now
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.920]   he walks away to do it again.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.520]   That's not the gospel.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:34:00.120]   The gospel of Jesus Christ says that man, the judge gets the beating, that man dies.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.080]   And he's buried with that judge.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.160]   And he's resurrected as a new person.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   So the person who walks out is not the same person.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.200]   It's not that same sinner.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.040]   It's not the same guy who's going to go out and perpetrate the same sins.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:24.120]   And that's why Paul says, "When there is genuine justification by faith and by grace alone,
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.320]   it's because that guy has died."
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.560]   That's why it doesn't lead to licentiousness.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.160]   He has been set free.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:40.120]   See, a man who has opened his eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ has
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.960]   changed.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.400]   Not just theoretically, not just theologically, not just positionally, but in reality has
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.480]   changed.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.260]   The Bible says that the law came to do what?
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.980]   To make sin utterly sinful.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.560]   And we use that to describe a theological position.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.120]   But imagine in plain terms what that means.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:09.920]   That the law came to make sin hideous, grotesque, ugly, horrendous.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:16.360]   The law came to show you that the sin that separated you from God, how ugly and hideous
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.960]   it is.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.720]   And that's why when the Bible describes a man who claims to have opened his eyes and
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.680]   returned back to his old way of life, what does that describe?
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.120]   Returning back to vomit.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.560]   Second Peter 2.19, 2.20, "For if after they have escaped the defilement of the world through
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.360]   the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.520]   overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.040]   For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness, than
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.360]   after knowing it, turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them."
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:58.040]   What the true proverb says has happened to them, "The dog returns to its vomit, and the
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.360]   soul, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire."
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.520]   That's a pretty vivid picture of somebody who's backslidden.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.600]   He says a man who returns to his vomit, like a dog.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.040]   See, a dog returns to his vomit because the dog doesn't see the vomit as vomit.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.680]   Dogs, he sees it as food.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.840]   As grotesque as it is, we can't blame the dog because the dog doesn't know any difference.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:32.880]   See, but when the law came and revealed that the very things that we considered food, the
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.360]   very things that we looked at and said, "Wow, I wish I had some of that," and we envied
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:42.040]   and coveted and slandered, cut corners and sent to get.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.480]   He said now it's revealed as vomit.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.200]   So an individual who has seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ and then now looks
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:55.080]   at the world and sees the grotesqueness of the sin that it's under the dominion of, can
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.440]   no longer return back to its vomit.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:06.040]   Isaiah, my youngest, when he was a little baby, he was a very good sleeper.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.480]   Very good sleeper.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.800]   So after about a year, year and a half, once he went to sleep, I mean he rarely woke up
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.640]   in the middle of the night.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.160]   Our other kids had issues, but Isaiah, once he went to sleep, and sometimes we were worried
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.120]   because he would never wake up, even when he was really sick.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   I remember one time I went into his room and he vomited.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.280]   And I don't know when it happened, but he vomited all over his bed.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   All over him.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:37.480]   He had stale vomit on his hair, his face, neck, I mean everywhere.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.840]   I wish I took a picture of it so I can show you, because words cannot do us justice.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.040]   And I walked in, I could immediately smell.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.480]   I walked in, and wow, he's sleeping late today, so we were really happy.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.440]   We walked in and he was just lying comfortably in his vomit.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.480]   Obviously he walked in and immediately, you know, I was like, oh my gosh, you know, as
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.080]   they're coming in here, pick them up, clean them up, change them up, you know, change
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.880]   everything and put new things in, you know.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:11.560]   He vomited and then whatever was bothering in his stomach, just, okay, it's over, let's
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.080]   go back to sleep.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.220]   He won't do that now.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.480]   He won't do that now because he knows the grotesqueness of vomit, so if he vomits, I'm
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.040]   sure he'll get up.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.640]   You won't do that.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.720]   If you vomited, you're not going to lay there.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.600]   See, that's how it's described.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.140]   See, the law came to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.880]   So if your eyes have truly been opened and you repented of this vomit that we were chasing
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:51.760]   after, what Paul is saying is a man or a woman who has genuinely repented of his sin does
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   not return back to that vomit.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:03.600]   In fact, it causes us to want more of Christ.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.280]   That's the evidence of true salvation.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:13.080]   That's the evidence that you've actually really seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:19.960]   And that's why when we are freed, he's not simply saying, "Hey, you're free.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.440]   The penalty of sin is gone."
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.960]   No, you're free.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.760]   You're free from the dominion of sin.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:30.720]   You're free from the power of sin so that you can pursue Christ freely.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:40.080]   The very thing that's going to give you life, now you're free to pursue it.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   We've repented.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.120]   As a reminder, we talk about the Ten Commandments.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.520]   We repented of worshiping the false god.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.320]   We repented of worshiping God in our own image.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:02.840]   We've repented of using the Lord's God, God's name in vain, invoking our will for his will.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:08.360]   We've repented of breaking the Sabbath by seeking rest in anywhere else but God.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:15.360]   We repented of dishonoring parents that God has given us to teach us how to honor him.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.700]   We repented of murder that we harbored in our heart because we allowed and harbored
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.240]   hatred in our heart to those around us.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:31.040]   We repented of adultery, allowing the lust to take and nest in our minds and in our lives.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:36.140]   We repented of slandering our neighbors because we've been offended by them.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:42.360]   And we've repented of the coveting and envying that repeats this whole cycle.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:50.960]   See, if we've repented of these things, if that's what actually happened, if you've truly
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:57.680]   been justified by faith, yes, that dirty cat may once in a while enter into your home.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.840]   It may cause you to cough.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:08.720]   But if you open that door and you allow it to live, it's either the cat or your husband.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:15.400]   Again, up to this point, Paul is not saying you ought to do this.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.600]   This is a description of what has happened to you, what has happened to me.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.520]   We are no longer creatures of the night.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.800]   We're creatures of the day.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.000]   This is why we don't see possums during the day.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.200]   You guys are confused.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.920]   Let's pray and end it right here.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.480]   Possums don't walk around during the night because they don't function during the day.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.200]   I mean, at night, they don't function during the day.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.800]   So every once in a while, you may run into a possum.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.560]   But if you see a possum during the day, it is absolutely jacked and confused.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.240]   It will look at you kind of like, "What is going on?"
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.000]   And it's going to look for some corner, some garage, somewhere where he can find darkness.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.320]   Usually during the day, they're hanging upside down on their tails.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:09.280]   If you see a possum during the day, something has horribly gone wrong with his life.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.920]   So his tail just didn't function.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.960]   His friends were joking around with him.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.960]   He was sick.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.880]   Something went wrong.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:25.560]   So in a possum, you see possum during the day, he is frantically looking for darkness.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.280]   But we're exactly the opposite.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.160]   God created us to function in the light.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.400]   So if you happen to wake up, if you happen to be on a camping trip and everything's dark
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.760]   and you don't have your flashlight and you have to go to the bathroom at three in the
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:41.800]   morning, you're probably sitting there thinking like, "Can I hold this till morning?"
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.200]   That's probably what you're thinking, right?
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.960]   Because you don't want to trick out in the middle of the night and go to the bathroom
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.520]   where you can't see, you don't have a flashlight, "Am I going to make it back?
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.520]   Am I going to pee on myself?"
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.920]   You got all these thoughts in your head and you're probably thinking, "Is it bad enough
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.920]   do I need to wake up?"
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.120]   Why not?
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.480]   Because you're not meant to function at night.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.680]   So you're going to wait until the light, the sun comes up so you can function.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:14.880]   So if you've been transformed and your old self is dead, see, a slave will see the light
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.600]   and look for a hole.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.240]   That's why they don't like teaching of the gospel.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:25.080]   That's why when the Bible is taught and the light is turned on, they don't like it.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.280]   But if you're a creature of the day and your old self has been crucified and now God made
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:35.880]   you a light, the darkness is very uncomfortable.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:43.480]   Yeah, sometimes you may sit and vomit, sometimes it may splash on you, but the reaction that
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:49.120]   you have, this is so filthy dirty, you want to hurry up and get it off of you because
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.640]   now you know it's dirty.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:57.200]   And that's what causes a Christian to run to God and ask for forgiveness because you
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.760]   don't like the feeling of vomit on you.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:08.960]   If anyone is in Christ, if anyone is genuinely in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.720]   The old has gone, was crucified, was buried with Christ.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.960]   Behold, the new has come.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.600]   We're going to get to the imperatives next week.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:18.800]   Let's pray.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:27.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
