[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.280]   Gracious Father, we just want to thank you so much for the opportunity for us to come
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.160]   together in fellowship and study your Word.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.400]   I pray that as we wrestle through the difficult passages of Leviticus, give us insight as
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.340]   to your intention, what you were trying to do, Lord God, with the nation of Israel and
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.200]   ultimately for us.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.120]   Help us not to turn from it to the left or to the right, not to add meaning, and to be
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.240]   able to understand, Lord God, all that you've done and all the intricacies, Lord, of preparation
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.120]   for the coming of Christ, that we'd be able to understand it and to be convicted by it
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.640]   and be changed.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.040]   And so we just entrust this time to you, Lord, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.000]   You know, in my questions, I asked you guys to make sure that you read and prepare.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.280]   So the questions I gave to you was to cover the first three chapters of Leviticus.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.160]   But as I was studying, I realized it's just way too much material to go over in one day.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.640]   And so we're just going to be covering the burnt offering today, which is going to give
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.000]   us a good foundation for how to understand the rest of the passages.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.960]   So next week, my intention is to go through chapter two and three, but chapter six and
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.580]   seven is really kind of an additional passages for the first five chapters.
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.400]   So there is a possibility I may get to chapter two and then just end up doing chapter two
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   as well.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.920]   So just kind of give you a heads up.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.720]   But for today, we're going to definitely only be covering chapter one, the book of Leviticus.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.360]   Again, as I mentioned to you before, Leviticus is not a book that you can just casually sit
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.320]   and listen.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.080]   Whether you are a brand new Christian or you've been a Christian for a while, you really need
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.800]   to do your homework before you come.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.220]   I really strongly encourage you.
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.560]   You don't need to understand all the material.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.600]   All I'm asking you to do is if I say the gates or a tent of meeting and you have the basin
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.040]   and you have the three different offerings in the burnt offering, that at least you know
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.740]   what I'm referring to.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.600]   But if you're having to look it up and say, what is he referring to?
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.520]   Is he in chapter one or chapter six or what is he referring to?
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   Then it's going to, I can guarantee it's going to go over your head.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.920]   So I really want to encourage you at least know the content.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.040]   You don't have to understand it.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.680]   That's why we're here trying to study it, but know what's in that passage.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   Okay.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.080]   So it's chapter one, next week, chapter two and three.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   Okay.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   Okay.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080]   Let's just jump right in.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:48.960]   I'm going to have to do.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   Okay.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   So the first part of it is just a brief review of what we talked about last time, how Leviticus
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.080]   is an instructional manual on how a sinner can have a relationship with a holy God.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.760]   So if you want to summarize what the intent of the book of Leviticus and why he's doing
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.320]   everything that he's doing is how can God's sinful people approach a holy God?
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.180]   That's the theme of the book of Leviticus.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:24.400]   So we saw that Exodus, Exodus is the Lord coming to Israel and establish the tent of
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.420]   meeting.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.880]   So Israel is delivered from the nation of Egypt.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.680]   They come out and God gives the law instructions and then the book of Exodus ends with the
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.120]   establishment of the tabernacle.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   Right.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.240]   And again, if you haven't read, you may be saying, well, what is a tabernacle?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   And this is the very reason why I really need you guys to read before you come.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.080]   So if I have to explain to you what a tabernacle is, what the altar is and what incense is,
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.400]   and you know, if you have no idea, if it's the first time hearing it, then it's really
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   going to go over your head.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.880]   So I strongly encourage you.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:06.560]   But I guarantee you, right, if you come prepared and you understand even 50% of what is being
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.360]   taught in Leviticus, it will open up the New Testament to you like it has never, never
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.160]   done before.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.720]   Because Leviticus is the preparation for understanding of fundamental doctrines of atonement, of
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.440]   propitiation, of blood sacrifice, laying on of hands, sacrifice without blemish, the Lamb
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.240]   of God, all these gospel terms are saturated in the book of Leviticus.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.120]   And so it's not just somebody saying, oh, here comes the Lamb of God.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.320]   A Jew would have had a clear picture of that Lamb of God that's being slaughtered through
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.560]   this book.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.000]   And so basically what this is, it gives you a physical illustration of the gospel itself
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.520]   to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.680]   So again, if you just kind of come casually, I'm thankful that you come either way.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.880]   Because I know a lot of you guys come in after long days of work, so I know you guys are
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   tired.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.000]   But if you're going to come, make the most of it, take the time to study, and try to
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.080]   glean as much as you can.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.480]   So I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.080]   This is not one of those studies you can just casually walk in and then walk out and think
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.240]   you're going to be able to follow along.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.800]   So I really strongly encourage you to do that.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.760]   Exodus is the study of the Lord calling or coming.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.280]   Leviticus is the study of God calling.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.440]   So Exodus, he comes down.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.520]   Leviticus, he calls to himself through a tent of meeting.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.960]   And then the book of Numbers is him dwelling among us.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.000]   And that's the whole point.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.280]   The whole point of the sacrificial system is that a holy God would dwell among sinful
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   people.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.920]   And this is how he was going to do this.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:59.280]   And we see the same pattern also in the New Testament, where Israel serves as a model
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.200]   for the new covenant people.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   And so we also see in the New Testament how Jesus draws near.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.700]   That's basically his birth, where he chooses to come off of his throne, and then he dwells
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.720]   among us.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.640]   He begins his ministry by calling his disciples to himself.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.040]   He said, "I will make you fishers of men," to go to the people.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.000]   And then his final result of his death and resurrection is that his Holy Spirit makes
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.880]   an indwelling in us.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.320]   In fact, I don't have it here, but if you were to take some time to outline the Old
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.240]   Testament versus the New Testament, you'll see a lot of similarities.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.560]   You see kind of a parallel where Genesis begins with God creating Adam, and then Adam falls,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.120]   and then the fall of man results in sin.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.080]   And then as a result of that is a need for sacrifice.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   And so you'll see a parallel.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.840]   In the New Testament, you see Christ coming, and then instead of falling, he actually succeeds,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.960]   lives a sinless life.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.240]   And instead of needing sacrifice, he becomes a sacrifice.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.320]   And instead of God dwelling in Israel, he dwells among his people, the church.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.280]   And so we see a parallel in the New Testament where Paul says, "Do you not know that you
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.760]   now are the temple of God?"
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.880]   So we're studying now in Leviticus where God is establishing his presence through the
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.680]   tabernacle, which eventually becomes the temple, where in the New Testament where Christ, he
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.640]   gives, he himself is sacrificed, and as a result of that, he establishes church as the
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.700]   temple of God.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.920]   So you see a parallel between what God is doing in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.960]   And the whole purpose of this is so that God would draw near to us, because we cannot go
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.600]   to him by our own effort.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   If you see here, I'm going to see if I can do this.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.960]   You see the picture?
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.200]   There's a tabernacle.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.440]   Let's see if it works.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.720]   You see it?
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.720]   Okay.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.720]   So that's the tabernacle.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.400]   That's what we're going to be studying in the sacrificial system.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.160]   Who are these right here?
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.540]   Anybody know?
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.580]   These are the Levites.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.920]   So you have four distinct tribes of the Levites, and if you, again, if we get to study the
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:17.360]   book of Numbers, it'll basically list God's plan of how he wants each of the tribes to
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.720]   be located, all centered around the tabernacle.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.280]   So the tabernacle, where it represents the presence of God, is right in the middle of
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.040]   the camp, and then the Levites, who are priests, who represent the people, are in between,
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.320]   who are these?
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.500]   The 12 tribes of Israel.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.780]   And this is how God wanted Israel to camp every time they sat down.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:44.520]   So every time they picked up, God had specific orders, which tribe goes first, and they have
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.520]   to march in order.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.000]   It's kind of like a military, like basic training.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.720]   And then whenever they stop, they have to stop in this order.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.800]   And then there was never any variation.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:02.840]   They always, for 40 years, as long as they march, this is how their camp looked like.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:10.600]   And there's a purpose for that, because no matter where they were at, at any given time,
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.080]   they were at, again, a short distance to the tabernacle, every single one of these tribes.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.120]   So when we're talking about God's presence dwelling in the midst of Israel, it was literally
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.440]   right in the center.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.540]   And this is how God designed it.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.160]   So what we're studying through the book of Leviticus is, if God is dwelling here, how
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.640]   do these people get to him?
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.400]   That's what Leviticus is.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.280]   And so today, and for the next few days, we're going to be talking about the establishment
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.120]   of the sacrificial system, and then chapter 8 and on, if you remember the outline, it's
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.840]   about the priests.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.480]   So the first part of it is about the sacrifices.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.880]   The second part of it is the priests.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.520]   And then there's a third part, but we'll talk about that later.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:11.440]   Did I turn it?
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.680]   I have some pictures for you guys to look at.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.040]   I actually went to a, what do you call it?
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:27.880]   Saddleback actually had a ministry that actually sets up a literal tabernacle in the life-size
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.120]   version, and so I thought that would be interesting, so I actually went and took a look at it.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.360]   And the first thing that struck me about the tabernacle was how small it was.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.360]   Because I was expecting for a million people out in the desert, all having access to God
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.560]   and the sacrifice, I thought that it would be humongous, like at least a football field
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560]   length.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.960]   Actuality, it's somewhere between about 75 feet to about 150 feet.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.800]   So I'm not exactly sure of the dimensions of this room.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.640]   So from here to back of that room would be about 100 feet, right?
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.840]   Did it go dark?
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.540]   Oh, you couldn't see.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.160]   And then from here to here, it's about 130, I think, right?
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.800]   So basically the size of the tabernacle is about the size of this room, maybe a little
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.360]   bit longer, a little bit narrower.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.880]   So no, it would be narrower.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.680]   So it would be something like this, more of a rectangle.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.520]   So it's not that huge.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.320]   And this sat right in the middle of the camp.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   And so if you look at it, this, let me see.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.600]   So this right here would be the holies, and it's divided into two parts.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.960]   And when we talk about the details of this, we'll talk about it at another time.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:48.640]   But this is where usually the person who's getting sacrificed is never allowed to go
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.840]   in here.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.940]   The sacrifices all took place right here.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:00.520]   So that's a version of outside picture, and this is the inside picture.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.160]   So the dimensions of this is pretty accurate.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.320]   I don't know if they built this to size, but it's pretty accurate.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.560]   So if you can notice, and then here's more of a close-up picture.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:21.900]   So this would be the altar.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:27.560]   This would be the leaven where they would wash the animal parts.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.480]   So if you read chapter one, you'll know they'll take the intestines and different parts of
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.800]   the body, and they would put it here, and they would wash it.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.080]   But the sacrifice would actually be offered here.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.000]   The dimensions of the altar itself.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.480]   So if you look in the bottom, 8.6 times 8.6 by 5 point something.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.960]   So the altar itself is not that huge.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.600]   It would be the size of that baptismal, but maybe a little bit wider.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.800]   So it's not huge either.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.520]   So think about the size of this.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.600]   I mean, considering that it's making regular sacrifices morning and night, and we're talking
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.640]   about hundreds and hundreds of animals being sacrificed for the various sins of Israel,
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:19.120]   and it was all taking place on that one particular altar for 40 years.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.240]   So I'm going to warn you ahead of time.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.160]   I have some pictures on here that are going to be pretty gruesome, and I did it on purpose.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.640]   And some of you guys who are eating may want to finish it up.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.800]   It's not coming up anytime soon, so you have about three minutes to finish your food.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   I'm just kidding.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.520]   It's coming up at the end.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   And I did it on purpose.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.480]   The reason why I did it is because this is what Israel saw.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   God didn't say, "Oh, this is gruesome.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.000]   I'm going to spare my people from this."
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.520]   God deliberately made this gruesome image of blood spilling everywhere.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.840]   And so can you imagine, we're not talking about blood being spread out in the size of
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   a football field.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.480]   We're talking about on that particular altar, there's an animal being sacrificed every single
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.480]   day.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.840]   And when they're sacrificed, they would take the blood and sprinkle it all over.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.960]   So can you imagine hundreds of animals being sacrificed on that one particular altar, what
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.800]   that altar looked like?
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   Can you imagine?
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.960]   So you have all this dried blood from years of blood just being, you know, and there's
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.800]   no instructions on cleaning that thing.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.960]   It was constantly in use.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.320]   And so there's dry blood and new blood on that thing constantly.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.700]   Animals' blood being spilled on that ground, hundreds and hundreds of them.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:41.360]   So you could probably imagine if you've ever seen a picture of a slaughterhouse, it would
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.120]   probably look like that, but not messier.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.120]   Because they don't have a neat way to dispose of this.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.720]   It was just being burned, right?
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.680]   And so the reason why, you know, at the end of it, I'm going to show you some pictures,
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.640]   is because this is God deliberately left this image in the nation of Israel.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.040]   So when God talked about the sacrifice of the lamb, it wasn't just something that they
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   imagined.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.200]   This was something that they smelled, they touched, and they saw on a regular basis,
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.520]   right?
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.720]   And it's a picture of sacrifice that God deliberately left with the nation of Israel, right?
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.840]   So Leviticus is kind of like, you know, when you sing songs when you were kids, you know,
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.960]   for those of you who are teachers or have parents, you know, when you would sing songs,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.520]   you would do body motions, you know, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.520]   shine.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.520]   I just made that up.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:41.560]   But I'm just saying, like, you would put motions to these songs to help you to memorize what
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   these songs are, right?
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.840]   And it's to help with the children.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.800]   Well, Leviticus is kind of like that.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:53.120]   Leviticus is a physical action where every part of what you're doing, it points to something.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.880]   It's to teach us something.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.720]   It's not meaningless.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.720]   Everything that God is doing, He's restricting certain things and He's commanding certain
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.800]   things and He's prohibiting certain things and He's telling you to touch it.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.920]   And so every aspect of what He is saying and what He's doing is by having them act it out,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.400]   He's trying to teach them something.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:20.520]   So our job is, as we are studying it, to try to figure out what is He trying to implant
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.960]   to the people who are sacrificing?
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.360]   How does this relate to and how does this help them to understand their need for sacrifice?
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.900]   What was He trying to teach them?
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.160]   So every physical act, right?
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.960]   Every spreading of the blood, every sprinkling, everything that they saw, smelled, and touched
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.120]   had a specific purpose.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.880]   So that's the thing that I want you guys to pay attention to as you're reading it.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.200]   Instead of just understanding, "I wonder what that means," think of it as a Jew who actually
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.480]   had to act this out.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.880]   What they were seeing, what they were smelling, what they were feeling, and all of it to prepare
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.400]   them for the need for Christ.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:13.080]   So just to give you an outline.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.520]   This is basically the outline of the tabernacle.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.320]   This is the entrance.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.920]   This is the altar.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.580]   This is the water basin where they washed.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.280]   This is the outer court where the sacrifices usually took place.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.160]   The inner court is beyond this line, right?
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.280]   And usually God had very strict restrictions on who can come to the outer court and who
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.640]   can come to the inner court.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.560]   So later on when the temple is built, right, where would have been the outer court where
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.960]   the Gentiles were coming?
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.080]   It would have been on this side.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.460]   So the Holy of Holies, like this area, was restricted.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.960]   And then the Holy of Holies, within this, the tabernacle, you had the holy place and
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.440]   then you had the most holy place, the Holy of Holies, right?
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.960]   So this is a basic outline.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.760]   So when you're reading through Leviticus and it says, "Make sure you take the animal to
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.600]   the outer court or bring them into the inner court or bring them to the Holy of Holies
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.360]   or the holy place," hopefully you have a visual picture of what he's referring to.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.840]   So the tabernacle is really not that complicated.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.520]   It doesn't have tons of articles.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:27.360]   He had very few articles that he placed in there and every single one of them had very
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.320]   specific purposes.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.680]   But sometimes because we're not familiar with what they are, the reason why we get lost
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.780]   is because we think that the tabernacle has like hundreds of things and hundreds of articles
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.640]   and hundreds of these things and then we get lost in it.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.200]   But again, if you look at the picture of the tabernacle, it's pretty simple.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.440]   You have the altar, you have the wash basin, you have the outer court, you have the inner
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.760]   court, you have the tabernacle, and then that's split in two.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.480]   And within the tabernacle, within this room, there are specific articles that's in there.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.360]   And we'll get to it when we get to that.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:06.160]   But what we're talking about the sacrifice is most of it is taking place out here.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.160]   Okay?
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:19.480]   So, okay, this is just a quick outline.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.120]   You had this last time I was up here.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.120]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:31.360]   You had the, what do we call this type of outline?
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.840]   Starts with a key, kiastic, right?
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:42.560]   So kiastic outline, basically it has .123 and then it has a middle point and then the
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.760]   second part has the same mirroring the other points but in an opposite order.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.640]   And the reason why the kiastic form is interesting is because you know exactly where the main
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.000]   point is.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   It's right in the center.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.040]   So what's the main point of this?
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.240]   The Day of Atonement, right?
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.360]   So all of it culminates to the teaching of the Day of Atonement in chapter 16 and 17.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.000]   And then, so remember we talked about how the first part of the outline, the sacrifices,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.560]   chapter 1 through 7, and then chapter 8 through 10 is about the cleansing of the priesthood
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:20.280]   and their preparation and then the last part of it is what is considered clean and unclean.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.760]   And all of it is for who?
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.000]   Mostly for the work being done at the tabernacle, right?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.840]   Making sacrifices and for the priest.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.920]   The second part of it mirrors it but who is that for?
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.240]   For the most part.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.320]   For the people, right?
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:44.040]   So the first part of it, you have the priest, you have the sacrifices, the priesthood, and
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.400]   clean and unclean, and then you have the Day of Atonement, and then the second part of
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.200]   it is in the reverse order.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.120]   What is clean and unclean for the people?
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.720]   Not specifically sacrifices but for people.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.400]   And then you have the priesthood, right?
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.080]   Where again the people of God and then finally the sacrifices specifically.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.840]   And it kind of mirrors.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.720]   So this is, I've talked about this before but this is just kind of as a reminder.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.800]   If you can memorize this outline, it'll help you tremendously when you're reading through
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.680]   Leviticus but even when you're lost, at least you know where you're lost.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.680]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.800]   You can get lost in Irvine but if you know you're in Irvine, you're not too bad.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.520]   But if you're lost in Irvine and you don't know you're in the United States, then you're
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.800]   going to be really lost.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.040]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.840]   So if you know this outline, if you're reading and it's like, "Oh, I don't understand it,"
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.920]   but you at least know that the theme is the same in chapter 6 and 7.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.920]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.400]   So if you're going to memorize anything, you don't have Bible memory for this session,
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.040]   I strongly encourage you to memorize this, right?
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.160]   And the chapters that fit in with that because that'll help you to read through, at least
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.480]   outline-wise, understand what's going on.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.640]   The five major offerings that we know, I'm not going to go through all of them, but you
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.840]   have the burnt offering which we're going to be covering today, the grain offering,
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.320]   peace offering, sin offering, guilt offering.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.800]   And each of these offerings met some need of the worshiper.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.120]   We're going to be talking about the burnt offering today.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.960]   So I won't go too much into that.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.040]   The grain offering is a dedication offering.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:29.320]   So the idea of tithing, presenting the first fruits, it all comes from this idea of the
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   grain offering.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.320]   So this is not the only passage that teaches this, but this is where this is introduced
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.760]   to the nation of Israel.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.200]   The peace offering, again, the significance of that is peace with God leads to peace with
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.040]   man, right?
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.800]   And so this is an offering where they would give an offering and most of the offering
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.120]   that they gave to God, the parts that you can eat, they would keep it separate and they
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.360]   would actually have a picnic with it, and that's the peace offering.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.280]   Sin offering deals with an inadvertent sin, right?
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.520]   And then the guilt offering is an offense that you've wronged somebody else and how
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.040]   to compensate when you've wronged somebody else.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.500]   So burnt offering, in a sense, is repenting with God.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.320]   Guilt offering, all of this is a repentance before God, but guilt offering has to do with
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.000]   offense that you've committed against somebody else.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.080]   So all of these things are different kinds of offerings that relate to your personal
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.480]   relationship or a corporate relationship with God.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.920]   And every one of these were necessary in order to have the holy God be in the midst of the
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.160]   community, right?
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.240]   He's not going to just show up and just sit anywhere.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.520]   That sin needed to be dealt with, and this was God's remedy of how sin was going to be
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.720]   dealt with.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.520]   So the burnt offering, or oftentimes it's called the whole offering, and the reason
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.680]   why it's called whole offering is because all of it is burnt up.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:02.520]   There's not a—only part that's not presented to God is the skin.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.760]   They would use the skin for, you know, obviously for various reasons, but the offering as a
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.740]   whole was offered up to God.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.560]   And we'll talk about the significance of that, okay?
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:17.000]   The purpose of this offering, it was the most important of the five offerings because of
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.160]   its significance.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.580]   It was the most important.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.040]   It was most often offered.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.980]   Every day, morning and night, the burnt offering was offered.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:36.800]   Not only was the burnt offering offered every single day, it was offered when other offerings
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   were offered.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:44.780]   In other words, because this was the sacrifice that represented general atonement for sin,
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.720]   you couldn't get to God to offer the other sacrifices until this was given.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.640]   Does that make any sense?
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.600]   Remember when Jesus says to the disciples, he says that, "If you do not allow me to
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.480]   wash your feet, I have no relationship with you," and Peter says, "Then wash my whole
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.400]   body," and says, "He who has bathed does not need to bathe again," right?
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   What was he referring to?
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   He's talking about the general atonement, right?
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.680]   "He who has repented and sins have been justified does not need justification over and over
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   and over again."
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.480]   He's talking about bathing.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.800]   But because you walk on this earth, your feet's going to get dirty, so you need to continue
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   to wash.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   What is he talking about?
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   Sanctification, right?
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.280]   To constantly live in repentance and forgiveness.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:34.040]   So this burnt offering represented the general atonement for the nation of Israel, and it
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.840]   had to be given repeatedly over and over again.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:43.280]   Even the sins that you were not aware of, it's just constantly coming before God, recognizing
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.520]   that my sins needed to be atoned for.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.640]   These sins that you knew of, sins that you didn't know of.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.840]   So oftentimes if somebody wanted to come and give a peace offering, they would give this
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.760]   offering first, to get right with God, and then they would give a peace offering.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.600]   So if they want to give a guilt offering, they would give this offering, and then they
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.760]   would give the guilt offering, right?
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.440]   So this was the most prominent and the most important of all the offerings, because of
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.200]   its frequency and because of its meaning, okay?
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.880]   Now I want you to remember all of this, because so much of the language in the New Testament
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:24.640]   about Christ's sacrifice is specifically referring to this offering, okay?
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.580]   It was a general offering given to establish peace with God for the atonement for sins.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:43.960]   So if you have your Bibles open, turn to Leviticus chapter 1.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:57.200]   Can somebody with a loud voice read verse 3 and 4?
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:09.440]   Nobody?
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.160]   If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.320]   he shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   the Lord.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.940]   Okay, so remember that.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.540]   This offering is to be given in order for him to be accepted before the Lord.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.460]   He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.640]   to make atonement for him.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:37.400]   So the idea of this, the meaning behind this offering is so that God would be able to accept
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.420]   him in his presence.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.560]   How is he going to do that?
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.100]   To atone for his sins, right?
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.320]   So when we talk about the idea of atonement, obviously the bigger idea comes from the day
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.200]   of atonement.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.040]   But the sacrifice that the nation of Israel would have immediately thought of when they
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.840]   thought of atonement is probably this sacrifice, right?
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.500]   So when you and I think of atonement, we think of like propitiation, we think of all these
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.280]   different words and try to save somebody.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.040]   Maybe you watched a movie of somebody going rescuing somebody, you know what I mean?
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:14.560]   So we have these imageries of somebody who is lost or maybe a ship that's lost in the
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.120]   ocean and a lifeboat going out and getting the life, you know what I mean?
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.040]   Lifeguards going and jumping into the water, saving them, strapping them.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.640]   So when we think of rescue, we have our own idea of what rescue means because of images
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.320]   that we've seen, the illustrations and the stories that we've heard.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:37.440]   Israelites, when they thought of atonement, sacrifice, immediately this was the picture
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.520]   that was in their mind 24/7.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.680]   This is, they had no TV, they had no Facebook.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.560]   This is, in some sense, this is a form of entertainment, right?
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.960]   Maybe that's a crude way to put it, but that's basically their stimulus was God deliberately
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.040]   gave the whole nation of Israel front row seats.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.720]   Now it is tented, but this tent does not go that high.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.360]   I don't know the exact height, but basically if you put somebody on your shoulder and they
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.560]   sat on your shoulder and looked over, you could actually see the sacrifices.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.840]   So this tent, the outer walls aren't that high.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.400]   So if you wanted to, not that you should, the nation of Israel, this was not like a
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.520]   fortress where they went into a cave where no one could see, right?
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.680]   This was right at the center and God gave every single tribe front row seats to what
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.760]   was happening.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.280]   This was happening for 40 years before they went into the temple.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:40.680]   So a Jew would have thought at that time, atonement, this is the sacrifice, right?
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.240]   And so we're going to go over exactly what they did because every part of that teaches
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:54.160]   us what happened with Christ and what it means for us, okay?
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.720]   Even the word atonement itself in Hebrew, kippur, I'm probably not saying that right,
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.800]   but has two different meanings.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.680]   One of the meanings is to wipe clean and the other is to pay a ransom, right?
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.400]   So in this context, which one is he referring to, to wipe clean or to pay a ransom?
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.840]   It's most likely both because you can't have one without the other.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:24.220]   You can't ransom, you can't pay for someone's sins until the sins are wiped clean.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:31.280]   So the idea of atonement has a sense of cleansing and ransoming, right?
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:38.040]   So in the New Testament, when the word ransom is used, again, this is the sacrifice and
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.960]   the imagery that they probably had more than any other sacrifice outside of the yearly
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:49.920]   day of atonement and the sacrifices that happened once a year.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:58.560]   And he says all of this is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:09.840]   So all of this was a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.760]   You know, Genesis 8, 20 through 21, if you know the context, you know, this is after
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.800]   the flood happens, the world is wiped out and only Noah's family exists.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:24.680]   And after the flood dies down, they come out and Noah gives a sacrifice.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.840]   And this is what he says.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.880]   "Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took some of every clean animal and some of
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.400]   every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.120]   So let me stop right here.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.000]   We're in Genesis, we're not in Leviticus.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.400]   Yet Noah is giving the burnt offering, right?
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.160]   So the sacrifices were already given.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.300]   People already knew to give sacrifices.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.680]   So then why is he introducing it in Leviticus, right?
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:57.520]   It was already innately understood that sacrifices needed to be made in order to atone for their
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.520]   sins.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:06.280]   But the book of Leviticus is specifically pointing to the coming of Christ, right?
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.240]   So the general understanding of sacrifice already existed.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.920]   And we see that even with Cain and Abel, right?
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   So the sacrifice was not introduced in Leviticus.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.840]   It was there from the very beginning of the fall.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.680]   But what's happening is as time goes by, God is basically honing in, right?
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:32.560]   Basically this, what do you call it, the shadow is becoming a bit more clearer.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.160]   Understand?
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.040]   No?
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.360]   You can see a shadow where the outline is not clear, but you clearly see it's a human
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.760]   being.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.800]   But as the shadow draws closer to the screen, you can see that the outline isn't just, it's
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.720]   not a blurry blob, but now you can kind of see the hair.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.000]   And then as he comes and he puts his face right up on it, and you say, "Oh, okay, I
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   know who that is."
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.840]   So that's basically what's happening in the Old Testament.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.240]   You see a fuzzy picture, right, of the sacrifice.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.080]   And then as time goes by, God gives more instructions, and the more instruction he gives is becoming
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   clearer and clearer.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.840]   So Leviticus is basically that sacrificial sacrifice that was needed is coming closer
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   and closer.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.280]   And we're beginning to see what he's pointing to, eventually.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.160]   So what's interesting here is it says, "When the Lord smelled," what?
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.920]   "The pleasing aroma."
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.280]   It was because of Noah's sacrifice, and it was pleasing to him.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.680]   The Lord said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.520]   For the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth, neither will I again strike down
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.600]   every living creature as I have done."
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.020]   So God makes a covenant with Noah that he's never going to do this again.
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.480]   But why did he do that?
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.240]   He did it in response to what?
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.340]   To this burnt offering.
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.040]   Because it was a pleasing offering to God, right?
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:56.520]   So this burnt offering in Leviticus chapter 1 was an offering that the nation of Israel
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.280]   was to come for what purpose?
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.720]   To please him, to be in his presence, to appease his wrath, right?
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:09.360]   And eventually, this offering was going to be replaced by the ultimate sacrifice, which
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   is Christ.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.000]   Okay?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.240]   Okay, I'm going to...
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.880]   Ephesians 5, 2, it's like, "Walk in love.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.800]   Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:30.000]   So again, so much of the language of the New Testament about not only the sacrifice of
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.560]   God, sacrifices of the sacrificial system, but even the language of calling us to live
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:41.880]   righteous lives, again, all of these vocabularies are all coming from the sacrificial system.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:47.480]   Philippians 4, 13, "I have received full payment and more, and I am well supplied, having received
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:53.480]   from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, fragrant offering, pleasing offering, a sacrifice acceptable
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   and pleasing to God."
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:01.800]   Okay, so this is just to show you how much Leviticus is saturated in the New Testament.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.440]   Okay, this is the part I really want you guys to pay attention.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:16.040]   Not that I want you to not pay attention to the other stuff, but...
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.200]   Okay.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.580]   So how the burnt offering was offered.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:30.880]   First of all, the animal must be brought by its owner into the outer court of the tabernacle.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   So here's the outer court.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   Okay, so step one.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.560]   Okay.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.880]   So when he comes to the outer court of the tabernacle entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.560]   right, this is where he brings it, and this is where it is determined if the worshiper
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:50.080]   and the animal brought for sacrifice was to be inspected, if they were acceptable to enter.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.640]   Now, the complete instruction of what was necessary is not mentioned here, right?
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.440]   Because this only refers to the sacrifice itself.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.840]   If you look at the complete instruction, there's regulations on not only defect for the animal,
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.880]   but on the human being, right?
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.000]   So if you had any kind of defect, or if you had any kind of disease, or not only did the
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.720]   sacrifice need to be perfect, but the sacrificer also had to be perfect, because he...
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:23.280]   Or certain things would disqualify him from entering into the tabernacle, right?
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.440]   Which was, again, I'm not going to go too deep into this, but remember in the Book of
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:33.440]   Acts, you had the eunuch from Ethiopia, how he was a God-fearer, and he was in Jerusalem,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.320]   he's coming back, and Philip, right?
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:42.960]   Philip the evangelist, he runs into him, and he says he was coming back from his worshipping
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.400]   Yahweh in Jerusalem, and then remember he says, "If somebody doesn't explain to me Isaiah
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.440]   53, how am I going to understand?"
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:55.600]   And he explains, and he hears about Christ, and then he converts and he gets baptized,
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   right?
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.600]   Random.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.520]   Because in the narrative of what's happening with the gospel, Ethiopian just comes out
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.880]   of nowhere, and then he disappears, and never appears again.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.760]   There's significance behind that, because the scripture says he would have been disqualified,
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.920]   one because he's an Ethiopian, he's not a Jew.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.600]   And so he probably went all the way to the temple, and he was never allowed to go into
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.360]   the inner parts of the temple.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.960]   He couldn't.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:28.320]   And so the fact that he converts, and he gets baptized, the hostility that caused him to
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.800]   be separated from God and his people would have been broken.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.680]   So the significance of that event, of the Ethiopian's conversion, is that the door is
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:41.640]   now being opened to everyone who was considered to be unclean.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:49.760]   Gentile, people who had diseases, who were maimed or blind, women, it was the door got
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.220]   kicked wide open, right?
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:57.680]   And so again, that's the significance of the Ethiopian conversion, and so what he's describing
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.800]   here is not comprehensive, it's specific for the animals, but he was to come to the outer
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.920]   court, and at the outer court the priests would come, they would inspect the animal
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.740]   to see if the animal is acceptable.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:14.320]   And he had to be, what, without blemish, it had to be perfect.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:20.560]   Now where does that, how does that help us in our imagery of God, of Christ's sacrifice?
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.100]   He had to be perfect, sinless, right?
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.780]   He who knew no sin became sin so that we may become the righteousness of God.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:32.340]   So he was the perfect sacrifice without defect, the Lamb of God.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.340]   That's where this imagery, the idea comes from.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:40.460]   That's why when Jesus went to, remember when he went to the wilderness and he was tested
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:45.900]   by the devil, the significance of that was if he failed, he would have been disqualified
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.580]   as a perfect sacrifice, right?
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:53.780]   So it wouldn't have mattered what he did the 30 years up to that point or the next three
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:39:00.020]   years, no matter how powerful he was, if he failed that test, he would have been disqualified.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.660]   Instead of failing that test, what does he do?
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:07.860]   He comes out of that, and though all of mankind failed, right?
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:12.620]   It was lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, lust of pride of life, every human being has
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.780]   failed that test.
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:18.620]   Jesus comes out of there in flying colors, and he puts the devil to shame.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:27.500]   And the significance of that was to testify that Jesus was the perfect Lamb.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:34.220]   So that was his credential that qualified him for the sacrifice for mankind.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.420]   That's why that testing in the wilderness is so significant.
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.420]   Okay?
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.780]   I hope you guys are getting this.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.460]   I hope it really sings sin because this is so rich.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:52.380]   What you understood about Christ, like it was all in Leviticus already.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:57.540]   It could have been a cattle, sheep, or goat, or birds, and why were there three separate
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.740]   sacrifices?
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:04.820]   It's not mentioned here, but it's God made provision for the rich, the middle class,
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.580]   and the poor, right?
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.700]   So if you happen to be a sojourner, if you didn't have as much money, God made provision
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.420]   so you can give birds, right?
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:19.940]   And you have to understand that in the Old Testament time, this period, that Israelites
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.100]   did not regularly eat meat.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:31.220]   So for them to offer up a sacrifice of these animals, financially, it was a huge burden.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.220]   So this was not just something that they had thousands of, and they just went out and picked
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.380]   one and offered it to God.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.940]   It was not out of convenience.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.780]   This is something that, you know, this peace offering that they actually had a meal was
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.820]   probably a huge, huge deal for them, right?
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:51.300]   So every one of these sacrifices they offered up to God was a big hit in their finances.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.660]   So these are sacrifices that actually meant something.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.940]   It actually was a sacrifice.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:02.700]   Not only was it a physical sacrifice, it was a financial sacrifice.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:09.100]   The most common offering, and understandably, was the male goat or the sheep.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.020]   The bull would have been very expensive, right?
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:17.460]   And then you had the chicken that was provisioned for the poor, and so that was only, if you
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.300]   couldn't afford anything, that's only the poor.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.140]   So the majority of the people would have been the middle class.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.540]   And the middle class, even in the desert, there would have been some people who had
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.780]   more than others.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.740]   And so the most common offering would have been the middle offering, right?
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:35.820]   So the male sheep without blemish, which is Jesus Christ, right?
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:41.500]   That's why he's called not the bull or the bird, but the Lamb of God, right?
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:49.140]   Because this was the image that the Israelites saw and smelled and tasted and touched on
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.900]   a regular basis.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.300]   The sight of a lamb being slaughtered and blood being gushed out for the atonement of
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:01.260]   your sins was a daily routine that they saw, right?
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:07.420]   Every Jewish child would have seen it, touched it, and had some experience killing an animal,
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:14.620]   especially for the purpose of sacrifice.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.720]   When he reaches the entrance of the tent of the meeting, he would lay hands, okay?
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.620]   So right here, and that would be the acceptance.
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:28.020]   He would lay hands on the animal, and the laying on of hands signify union with the
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.420]   animal, that I am one with this animal.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.020]   And it signified that animals would be sacrificed on behalf of the worshippers.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:41.820]   So when this animal sacrifices, vicariously, I am being sacrificed for this animal.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:46.900]   So basically, this animal represents me in this system.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:52.740]   And that's so he would lay his hands, so once the priest says it's acceptable, right, that
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.140]   animal would take his place for his sins.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:43:02.020]   Again, all of this, right, is clearly pointing to Christ.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:07.420]   Laying of hands, that's why in the New Testament it says in ordination to not to be hasty,
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.840]   because when you lay hands on somebody, it means you're uniting with that person.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:16.940]   So the idea of laying on of hands in the New Testament isn't somebody in authority giving
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.940]   power.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.660]   I have power, and I'm asserting power and giving some of it to you.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.740]   That's not the idea of laying hands.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.840]   Laying hands basically means that we are becoming one.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:32.180]   And that's why, I'm not sure if I have that passage here.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:40.060]   Okay, so I don't have it.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:49.220]   All right, so can somebody turn to 1 Timothy chapter 5, 22?
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.220]   Nobody?
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.220]   Wait, who's?
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.220]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:57.220]   I thought it was reading here, and I...
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:02.460]   Okay, go ahead, sorry.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:19.580]   Okay, good.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:33.460]   Verse 22 is, "Do not be hasty in laying on of hands, nor take part in the sins of others."
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:38.140]   So if you lay hands hastily, that person's sin, because you're uniting with that person,
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.060]   it basically means that if he sins, you sin.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:46.180]   So the idea of laying on of hands is not, at least in the biblical sense, isn't I have
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.300]   this power that I'm imparting to you.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.580]   Only God has that power, and we're not kings.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.580]   It basically is saying we watched their life, we tested them, and we're united with that
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.580]   person.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.540]   So we lay hands when we pray, and we're sending missionaries off, we lay hands on them saying
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.540]   that we're going to, in spirit and in prayer, we're going with you.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.540]   That's what that means.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:11.940]   When we ordain people into ministry, we're saying that we're basically inviting him to
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.580]   be one of us.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.500]   That's what ordination ultimately means.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:21.580]   And so if you do this hastily, you're going to sin along with his sins.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.260]   So that's why he's saying be careful not to do that hastily.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:28.980]   And so the idea of laying on of hands in the Old Testament, in the sacrifice, is I lay
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.180]   my hands on this animal, and him and I are one, but then this animal is going to take
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:42.300]   my place as a sacrifice.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.500]   So the person offering the sacrifice is commanded to kill the animal.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:52.020]   So in this particular, this is not true of all the sacrifices, but in the burnt offering,
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:56.120]   the offerer himself kills the animal.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:01.580]   He doesn't just come and lay hands and then shoves and then he disappears.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.820]   He actually has to pick up the knife, and he has to slit the throat.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.300]   He has to watch the blood being drained.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:14.900]   And then after that happens, he has to cut the animal into pieces, and he has to do all
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:21.100]   of this, all for the purpose of the sacrifice.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:27.820]   The word for kill, shahad, is not the typical word for killing.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:35.400]   This is a specific Levitical term that's reserved for sacrificial offering.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.740]   So again, a Jew who would have read this in Hebrew would have clearly been able to understand
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.780]   that he wasn't just killing the animal, he was sacrificing the animal, specifically for
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.780]   this.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:50.700]   So in all purposes, he is killing this animal, but it was specifically for the purpose of
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.980]   sacrifice, and it was reserved for sacrificial slaughter.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.620]   The word denotes a specific ritual killing and ensured the blood was drained out of the
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:13.980]   animal's body, which then the blood was offered to God.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:23.500]   And then the priest would take the blood and sprinkle the sides of the altar.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:27.060]   And in a nutshell, this is what happens.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.980]   He would come into the court, wait for the priest to come.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:35.780]   The priest examines the animal, examines the person, and is acceptable.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.700]   When it's accepted, he would lay his hands on the animal, ready to be slaughtered.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:45.260]   And once that happens, he would pick up his knife and he would go to the north side of
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.580]   the altar, and then he would kill the animal.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.300]   And he would drain the animal of its blood, this ritual killing.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:57.140]   And he would wait until the life of the animal was completely out of him, and when it was
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:03.340]   lifeless and limp, he would take that animal, cut off its head, open up its intestines,
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.820]   take all of these things out, cut off its limbs, take it to, remember, that basin, and
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.620]   wash it all out, all of it out.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:14.860]   And then he would skin the animal, and then the priest would take the blood, and then
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.140]   you see that altar, and he would take this blood.
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.220]   Imagine if it was a goat, I mean, how much blood there would be.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:23.060]   This is not a small chicken, right?
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.920]   Imagine how much blood there would be if it was a bull.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.100]   He would take all that blood, and then he would carry it with him and just sprinkle
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.940]   all over.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.940]   And that sprinkling signifies cleansing, ritual cleansing, getting prepared.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:39.660]   And then once he would do that, he would take all of the sacrifice, put it on the altar,
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.500]   and he would burn everything.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:48.500]   So you have to understand that Israelites were not normally eating meat because it was
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.740]   too expensive.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.820]   But none of this was to be touched.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.620]   And I'm sure they may have been tempted.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:49:01.180]   I mean, this is a sheep or goat that, you know, if you normally slaughtered it and brought
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.100]   it into a dinner table, it would have been delicious.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.220]   But they weren't allowed to touch any of that in this ritual.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.220]   All of it was burnt up.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:11.860]   The only thing that they were able to preserve was the skin, and that was offered to the
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:16.020]   priest for them to use for maybe tents or whatever it is that they were going to use
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.020]   it for.
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.360]   And that's why this is called the whole offering.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:27.740]   And so the significance of this whole offering for the atonement is that every single part
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:32.140]   of this animal is under condemnation.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.140]   One hand is laid.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.540]   There's nothing to be salvaged.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:41.980]   That's why this represents most closely to the sacrifice of Christ, that He didn't just
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.100]   offer up His blood.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.860]   He didn't just offer up a period.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.200]   He offered up His whole life.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.520]   And it signifies, even for our own salvation, that when we repent, our repentance isn't
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:58.140]   just compartmental, like, "I repent because I did this on Saturday, so I did this, and
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.700]   I shouldn't have done that."
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:03.340]   This repentance justification, when we come before God and we repent, we don't repent
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:08.980]   because we lied, because our sin's much deeper than that.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.100]   We don't just repent because we have purity issues or we have the...
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:19.700]   This offering basically signified that this sin is so deep, there's nothing to be salvaged.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.740]   There's nothing in our lives.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.580]   That's why when we convert, He says, "You must be born again."
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.500]   That whatever it is that you were before is crucified and is gone.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.580]   You have to become a new creature.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.020]   That's what this offering signifies.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:38.500]   All of it, all of it is crucified with Christ, and all of it is redeemed by the blood of
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.500]   Christ.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.820]   Again, the significance of it being the whole offering.
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:47.900]   Now I'm going to show you the bloody part, okay?
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.940]   And let me explain to you why I want you to see it.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:59.620]   Because God deliberately left this imprint on the Israelites.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.620]   And so I think it's helpful for us to see.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.380]   Can you dim the light so we can have even a better picture?
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:09.140]   If you haven't eaten, I want you to really see it.
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:10.140]   Okay?
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.540]   Just dim it as much as you need to so that you can see it.
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:15.260]   Hey, turn it all off right here.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.580]   I want you to see a 3D version.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:23.220]   Yeah, maybe even turn me off.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.940]   Okay.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.780]   All right.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:38.820]   I wish you could see it better, but this is the best that we can do for now.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:44.900]   Okay?
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:52.220]   All right, that's it.
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.740]   I just want you to let it sink in.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.820]   Okay, can you turn the lights back on?
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.340]   That's blood on the ground.
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:58.340]   Okay?
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:03.240]   Now, this probably, this is a tame version, right?
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.600]   If you came in and actually sacrificed, this was not something that you just came into.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   You did this.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.580]   That, you know, I heard some of you guys gasping when you saw the head of that goat.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.100]   You did that.
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:20.500]   If you came to sacrifice, you would have done that and you would have put that on the floor.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.140]   I mean, obviously, we don't live on farms.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:25.040]   And, you know, remember Dr. Proud?
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.500]   He actually used to be a butcher.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:30.580]   So, you know, for somebody like him who butchers for a living, I'm sure he doesn't get shocked
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.580]   by this image.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.800]   But for most of us who didn't grow, you know, grow on farms or animals, I mean, it's kind
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.900]   of a gruesome scene.
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:44.100]   But every single Israelite had a front row seat to this sacrifice.
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:50.280]   And every single one of them probably stepped in a pool of blood on a regular basis.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   And why did he do that?
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:56.060]   Why did he leave this bloody scene that's so gruesome?
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.620]   In fact, what you're seeing is probably on a daily basis.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:05.920]   Can you imagine what the temple of God, temple looked like during the Passover?
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:12.460]   They said that somewhere around 70,000 lambs were offered during the Passover at the temple.
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:18.900]   And so can you imagine just slaughtering 70,000 animals all for the purpose of just sacrifice?
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:25.040]   So all of this, so all of these sacrifices, the priests and the order, all of that culminated
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.920]   to the Day of Atonement.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:32.460]   And at the Day of Atonement is this for every single person in Israel.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.080]   So can you imagine what that slaughter would have looked like?
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.500]   And then they have to take this blood, not only sprinkle it around the altar, the priests
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.600]   have to take that and enter into the Holy of Holies and then make it a bloody scene.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:49.260]   So typically when you see the tabernacle, inside of the tabernacle, you see nice, clean,
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:55.500]   shined furniture with golden lamp stands, because that's probably what it looked like
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:58.020]   when they first made it.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:04.700]   Imagine just one use in one year, after the blood is sprinkled all over for the sins of
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:11.660]   Israel against the curtains, against the curtains of the tabernacle, everything, right?
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:15.100]   The Ark of the Covenant, it was just saturated with blood.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:19.700]   It was a bloody, bloody scene.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:27.300]   All of this was basically to give a physical image of our sins.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.460]   It was a physical image of our sins.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:36.340]   And it was a physical illustration of the need for this atonement.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:43.940]   So when a Jew thought about the sacrifice, he basically was schooled for thousands of
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:49.380]   years of what was needed for his sin.
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.780]   When we come into the New Testament, we talk about atonement, sacrifice, the Lamb of God,
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:58.780]   we all kind of project our own idea and we kind of water it down to make it palatable
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.860]   for you and I.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.300]   But God did not do that.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.980]   God deliberately made it gruesome.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:15.180]   Because again, every part of this reveals the gruesomeness of our sins and the necessity
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:23.380]   of what was needed, what this multiply million by million to atone for our sins.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:30.540]   So I think it is extremely important that you and I grasp the gravity of our sins because
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.860]   it was illustrated to the nation of Israel.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:39.700]   Hebrews chapter 9, 18-26, "Therefore, not even the first covenant was inaugurated without
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:40.700]   blood.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.940]   But when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people,
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:48.340]   he took the blood of calves and goats, the water and scarlet wool in his sip, and sprinkled
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.860]   both the book itself and all the people, saying, 'This is the blood of the covenant that God
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.420]   commanded for you.'
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:58.540]   And in the same way, he sprinkled with blood both the tent and all the vessels used in
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:55:59.540]   worship.
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:02.740]   Indeed, under the law, almost everything is purified with blood."
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.740]   Meaning everything.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:06.980]   It was just everything in the tabernacle was saturated with blood.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:10.580]   "And without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.820]   Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.780]   rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:23.460]   For Christ has entered not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.980]   things, but into heaven itself, not to appear in the presence of God on our behalf, nor
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:31.980]   was it to offer himself repeatedly as the high priest enters the holy places every year
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.360]   with blood not his own.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.480]   For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:43.260]   But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.460]   the sacrifice of himself."
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:50.660]   So all of this bloody scene was simply a shadow of the reality that Jesus was going to fulfill
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:57:00.100]   in reality with his blood, with his body, with his life, all of it.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:04.540]   And so after the killing, he would chop up the animals and then the priest would burn
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.580]   it and all of it.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:12.880]   The worshipers was to wash the hind legs and the internal organs in the basin.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:28.140]   And then the priest burned everything, all of it.
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:41.020]   Usually it was men.
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:46.620]   Well the children were considered men after the age of 13.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:57.620]   But typically it was the men represented the families.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:02.060]   And I think the passage in Romans chapter 12, "I appeal to you therefore brothers, by
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:05.580]   the mercy of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:07.180]   which is your spiritual act of worship."
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:14.780]   And again, a Jew hearing this would have probably, you know, same words, but with him would have
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:21.900]   been coupled with that imagery of his complete sacrifice, a dead animal, right?
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:31.980]   And so finally, burnt offering is ultimately fulfilled in Christ.
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:32.980]   Fulfilled in Christ.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:38.940]   And I just have a few verses to, 1 Peter 1, 18, 19, "Knowing that you were ransomed from
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:43.340]   the feudal ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:50.820]   or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot."
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:54.980]   Mark 10, 45, "For even the son of man came not to be served, but to serve and to give
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.140]   his life as a ransom for many."
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:01.340]   1 Peter 2, 5, "You yourselves, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:06.540]   house to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.540]   Christ."
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:14.140]   So again, all of the language in the New Testament, it has its origination in the specific teachings
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.900]   of the sacrifices in the Old Testament.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.660]   So again, how important is Leviticus?
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:20.860]   Extremely important, right?
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:24.540]   Just going into New Testament is kind of like, you know, you have, you know, let's say you
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:29.920]   have, I don't know, English 101 or History 101, 201, 301, 401.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.420]   Is that how it's divided still?
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:35.040]   Just go with me, okay?
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.760]   So you have to take it in order, but if you jump in and only know the New Testament, it's
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.360]   kind of like jumping into the 301, 401 class without taking the foundation.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.860]   The foundations are necessary, right?
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:50.700]   You need to know how the plus and minuses work before you get the calculus.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:56.800]   And so New Testament is kind of like the building that was built upon the foundation, but the
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.880]   foundation is in the Old Testament.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.680]   This is part of the reason why I wanted you to come into the book of Leviticus is because
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:09.700]   it really opens up the New Testament to help you to understand, right?
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:14.540]   It's not, it may not change, but it'll make your understanding of the gospel and Jesus'
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:19.540]   sacrifices so much richer if you really understood where it came from.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.540]   Okay.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.520]   So the discussion question fourfold today.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.940]   In school, and this is related to, again, how God is using illustration to teach Israel
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.320]   about sacrifice and atonement.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.060]   In school, what lesson do you remember the most and why?
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.580]   Was it visual, oral, or written?
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.280]   What made the lesson so memorable?
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:44.620]   And I remember the lesson about photosynthesis during a period that I could care less what
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.660]   photosynthesis was.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:54.360]   And to this day, I remember that lesson because our, my biology teacher in 10th grade dressed
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.620]   up as a crazy professor, and he was also our baseball coach.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:03.620]   And so he dressed up as a professor and he laid down photosynthesis on the ground and
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:08.220]   with his thick German accent, and he spent the whole hour jumping around showing us.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:12.540]   And again, this is during a period where I could care less.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.300]   I'm not even sure why I was in class that day.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.940]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:22.100]   But I remember so distinctly that lesson, that particular lesson.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:27.500]   If he sat there and he shared with me, like, talked about photosynthesis, I probably wouldn't
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.060]   have even remembered that day.
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.020]   But I remember that day because he illustrated.
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:37.660]   He went out of his way to illustrate with pictures and being dressed up and with his
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:42.500]   accent running around animated for over an hour.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.700]   That's Leviticus, right?
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:52.580]   This was so important that God made the priest dress up and he set up this system because
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:02:01.020]   he wanted to make sure, he wanted to make sure that his people understood what was coming
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.320]   and what was needed, right?
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.460]   So what do you remember?
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.660]   So read Hebrews 1, 1 and 2 along with it.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:14.220]   In what way do you think the burnt offerings appeared, prepared the Israelites for the
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.660]   sacrifice of Jesus for our sins on the cross?
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.900]   Be as specific as possible.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:24.780]   And then third, what is one thing you would be willing to sacrifice everything to have?
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.020]   And be honest.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.700]   You're willing to sacrifice everything to have.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.060]   What is this one thing?
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:38.820]   Four, God calls us to be a living sacrifice as an act of worship in light of Jesus' sacrifice
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.060]   for us.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.680]   Is your life a burnt offering, whole offering given to the Lord's use, or are you holding
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.100]   back parts of it for your use?
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:50.260]   Would a partial sacrifice of the Lord been accepted in the Old Testament?
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.660]   You think any part of that offering would have been accepted if they said, "You know
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   what?
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.100]   This back meat, ribs is so delicious.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:02.340]   What if I gave 90% of it and I held this back and took it home and ate it?
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.260]   I haven't eaten meat in a while."
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.260]   God would understand.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.580]   Would that sacrifice would have been accepted?
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.620]   Obviously not, right?
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:13.500]   This sacrifice represented all of us, every part of us.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.140]   So Romans chapter 12, when it says, "Offer your bodies as a living sacrifice," He's not
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.820]   saying your legs, your mouth, your head.
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.960]   He's talking about all of it, right?
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.420]   So that's the question, right?
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.180]   So let me pray for us, and then again, I'll break you guys off and take some time in your
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.380]   small group for discussion, okay?
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:36.620]   Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:42.580]   There's so much in your Word, Lord, that we have yet to discover.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:47.380]   So much, Lord God, that we've just kind of gleaned through because we didn't understand
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.220]   that it was difficult.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:54.560]   Help us, Lord God, to uncover these treasures.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:04.220]   If your sacrifice of your Son in any way has become trivial to us, old news, something
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:14.220]   that we've heard so often that it's hard for us to even muster up any emotions, I pray
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:19.820]   that the study of Leviticus would help us to visually see what it is that you've done
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:27.740]   for us, that we may be moved, impacted, stirred, and convicted, Lord God, that you would renew
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:32.020]   in us true worship in spirit and in truth.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:37.260]   I pray that you would bless our time of discussion, help us to be honest and open in our weaknesses,
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:43.300]   that we would truly be able to partner together, covering over our weaknesses and sharpening
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.480]   as brothers one for another.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.980]   So we ask for your grace over this time.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.460]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
