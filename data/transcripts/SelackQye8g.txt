[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.860]   Hope you enjoyed the meal that you had together
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.860]   and you were able to share in the Thanksgiving Feast
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.860]   and in the company that we had together.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.860]   I think many years ago, we used to do it.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.860]   It wasn't that many years ago, actually,
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.860]   when we probably did it here at church,
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.860]   but as the church has grown,
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.860]   to be able to separate like this
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.860]   so that we can have the more tight-knit community,
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.860]   it is hopefully a sweet time for everybody.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.860]   So thank you especially to the hosts
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.860]   who opened up their homes.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.860]   Tonight, we're going to be spending just a little bit of time
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.860]   singing some praises together.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.860]   So even from home, please do sing along,
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.860]   and afterwards, there will be a brief time of sharing
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.860]   followed by some discussion.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.860]   So I'll pray for us,
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.860]   and then we'll move into some singing together.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.860]   Heavenly Father, we thank You for drawing us together.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.860]   Lord, for those of us who already know each other
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.860]   and especially for those we were just able to meet,
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.860]   God, I pray that our hearts would overflow together
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.860]   with gratitude towards You.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.860]   God, we pray that You'd be honored
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.860]   in the way that we would speak to each other,
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.860]   that we would speak of You.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.860]   And Father, that it would be something that we treasure,
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.860]   God, that we are marked by being joyful people.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.860]   And so, Lord, as we sing these praises to You,
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.860]   we do pray that You'd be honored, You'd be glorified,
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.860]   and Lord, would You affect our hearts.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.860]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.860]   Well, again, welcome back everybody
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.860]   to our Thanksgiving annual dinner that we do.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.860]   We do this every year.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.860]   And something that we wanna take the day
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.860]   and the season to remember, even as was preached today,
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.860]   to be thankful together.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.860]   Why it is that we have so much to have a great gratitude over
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.860]   and as we're eating, as we're spending company
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   with each other, I hope that that is what ultimately
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.860]   kind of overwhelms us, to be thankful as believers.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.860]   Even as we're singing, the first song that we sang
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.860]   talked about the gratitude, that we're saying thank you
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.860]   to our God.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   And it's not very difficult to take a moment
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.860]   and look at a passage like Romans 8:31,
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.860]   a very, very familiar passage to all of us,
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.860]   where it says, "What then shall we say to these things?
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.860]   "If God is for us, who is against us?
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.860]   "He who did not spare His own Son,
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.860]   "but delivered Him over for us all,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.860]   "how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?"
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.860]   And so when we're saying thank you to God,
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.860]   it's easy as Christians to be able to
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.860]   kind of say these things out loud,
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.860]   that we're so thankful to God for what He has given to us.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.860]   Namely, this is His Son.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.860]   It says, "He did not even spare His own Son.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.860]   "He delivered His Son over to us.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.860]   "And so in this, He will then with Him
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.860]   "give us all things freely."
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.860]   That is God's heart for us.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.860]   We have much to be thankful for.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.860]   In James 1:17, it says, "Every good thing given
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.860]   "and every perfect gift is from above,
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.860]   "coming down from the Father of lights,
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.860]   "with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.860]   "In the exercise of His will,
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.860]   "He brought us forth by the word of truth
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.860]   "so that we would be a kind of firstfruits
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.860]   "among His creatures."
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.860]   So anything that is good,
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.860]   anything that is given as a gift,
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.860]   is perfectly given from God.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.860]   And this God is a Father of lights.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.860]   He doesn't change.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.860]   He can only exercise this giving in accordance
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.860]   to who He is.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.860]   So tonight, we'll go through two main things,
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.860]   but I wanted to ask that question.
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.860]   If we are to be beyond grateful
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.860]   for all that He has given,
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   then what is causing in us a complaining
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.860]   and a grumbling spirit?
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.860]   So why are we not perpetually grateful people
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.860]   when we've been given such a great gift?
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.860]   So our first point here is that we are not grateful
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.860]   because we confuse desires with needs.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   And this is something I'm sure many of us
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.860]   have thought about.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.860]   We're confusing our desires with needs.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   I think there should be a, okay, good.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.860]   There's a picture.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.860]   This one is a shout-out to PPK,
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   his favorite place.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.860]   But when you look at it,
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   you don't have to turn very far
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.860]   to see faces like this at amusement parks.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.860]   It doesn't have to be Disneyland.
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.860]   It could be anywhere.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.860]   And you can see these children
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   who are crying at these parks,
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.860]   and perhaps it's very, very simple
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.860]   to kind of look into why they might be crying.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.860]   They're crying because they've confused
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.860]   the desire with the need.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.860]   So it's okay for somebody to have something
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.860]   that they would want,
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.860]   but when they say, "I must have it,"
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.860]   or else, and you fill in the blanks,
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.860]   there's going to be many teary-eyed children
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   at these kinds of amusement parks.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.860]   Essentially, in their tears,
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   and they're crying,
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.860]   they're saying, "I must have it.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.860]   I need to have this."
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.860]   And so this is the opposite of gratitude,
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.860]   this grumbling and complaining spirit
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.860]   where someone says, "I need it.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.860]   I must have it."
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.860]   In essence, one is saying that, "I deserve it.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.860]   I'm supposed to have this thing."
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.860]   And sadly, we look much more like this crying child
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.860]   than we'd like to think.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.860]   We confuse our desires and see them as needs,
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.860]   and in that, we will not be grateful people
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.860]   if we think of so many things in our lives
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.860]   as something that I must have,
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.860]   I deserve to have, and I need to have.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.860]   So we could go down a laundry list of things.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   In our careers, be honest with yourselves.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   We have to be honest with self and our hearts.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   I need to have this career.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.860]   I need to get this raise.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.860]   I need to climb this ladder.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.860]   And we confuse our desires and needs.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.860]   I need to have control, then comes into the picture.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.860]   In our relationships, I need to be respected.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.860]   I need to be loved.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   I need to be known.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.860]   There are many things that our hearts might demand
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.860]   as something that we deserve, as something that we need,
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.860]   and we confuse our desires with needs.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.860]   In our leisure, I need to have my own time.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.860]   I need to have this vacation.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.860]   I need to have work-life balance.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.860]   It needs to look a certain way.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:18.860]   All of these things are when we confuse desires and needs.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.860]   And just like this child back here, the two--
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.860]   I forget how many there are.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.860]   There's two.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.860]   There's probably many more in that park.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.860]   They're saying that.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.860]   We're saying that.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   In our hearts, when we grumble and complain,
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:36.860]   we're saying, "I need, I must have, I deserve."
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.860]   This is the opposite of gratitude.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.860]   If you can imagine any person who's just incredibly entitled,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.860]   if you've come across anybody that just feels so entitled
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.860]   to something in their lives,
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   you can see a person who confuses desires and needs,
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.860]   that they're saying, essentially, "I deserve these things.
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.860]   "I must have this.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.860]   "And I'll be angry.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.860]   "I'll be upset.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.860]   "I'll do whatever I need to do with my words,
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.860]   "with my behavior to manipulate the situation,"
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.860]   versus if you've come across a genuinely humble
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.860]   and grateful person.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:15.860]   They can desire, but they'll be grateful when they receive.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.860]   Needs are something that we cannot do without.
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.860]   It's essential.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   We can go to the next slide for this one.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.860]   So when we're talking about, "I need something,"
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.860]   we're saying that we cannot do without it.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.860]   It is an essential thing in my life.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.860]   So when we look at needs and desires,
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.860]   we have to ask ourselves, honestly speaking,
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.860]   "What are we saying I need to?"
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.860]   So Philippians 4:19, it says,
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.860]   "And my God will supply all your needs
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:52.860]   "according to His riches and glory in Christ Jesus."
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.860]   So that ends our case.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.860]   It's done.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.860]   What this passage is saying, in other words,
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   there is nothing that we can complain about ever again.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.860]   All our needs are met.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:07.860]   We have everything that we need.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.860]   And so there's nothing that we can be grumbling
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.860]   and complaining over.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.860]   Just as we might look at those children and say,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.860]   "You have everything.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.860]   "You've been given such a great gift.
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.860]   "This is such a happy place to be at,"
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:26.860]   and for them to be weeping because they don't have something more.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.860]   Many of us look more like that.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.860]   In this place where we have these needs
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.860]   that are met by our God,
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.860]   present-day circumstance then doesn't dictate our contentment.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.860]   In Philippians 4:11, it says,
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.860]   "Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.860]   "in whatever circumstances I am.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.860]   "I know how to get along with humble means,
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.860]   "and I also know how to live in prosperity.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.860]   "In any and every circumstance,
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.860]   "I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry,
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:02.860]   "both of having abundance and suffering need."
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.860]   You can have somebody that has so much,
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.860]   and they could be unhappy.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.860]   And on the flip side, you can come across somebody
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.860]   who has so little, and yet they are so content.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.860]   So it has very little to do with that present circumstance.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.860]   I'm sure we've heard of fellow believers
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.860]   who have gone on mission trips
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.860]   and witnessed how sometimes Christians around the world
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   have so little in comparison to what we have,
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.860]   and yet because they have Christ, the same Christ we have,
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.860]   they are so content.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.860]   They are so happy.
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.860]   Materialism really has decimated the church.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.860]   Elizabeth Elliot says,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.860]   "God has promised to supply all our needs.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.860]   "What we don't have now, we don't need now."
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.860]   I thought that quote was very short and succinct,
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.860]   but very clear.
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.860]   "What we don't have now, we don't need now."
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.860]   Why? Because we have Christ.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.860]   We have all that we need in Christ.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.860]   We are content forever,
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.860]   and there is no grumbling or complaining
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:09.860]   that can come out of the mouth of a Christian.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.860]   Contentment is something we have to shoot for
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.860]   because it goes hand-in-hand with gratitude.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.860]   This is what Jerry Bridges says.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.860]   "Gratitude is a handmaiden of contentment.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.860]   "An ever-growing attitude of gratitude
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.860]   "will certainly make us more content
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.860]   "since we will be focusing more on what we do have,
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.860]   "both spiritually and materially,
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.860]   "than on what we do not have.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.860]   "But contentment is more than focusing on what we have.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.860]   "It is focusing on the fact that all we do have,
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.860]   "we have by the grace of God.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.860]   "We do not deserve anything we have,
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.860]   "materially or spiritually.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.860]   "It is all by His grace."
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   So there is no grumbling or complaining
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.860]   that can come out of the mouth of the believer.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   We are marked by being grateful people,
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.860]   filled with joy, filled with contentment.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   And essentially, this is what worship is.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.860]   And this is our second point, our last point.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:09.860]   Gratitude is the natural fruit of worship.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.860]   Very, very interconnected.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.860]   Gratitude, worship.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.860]   God is the only place--
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.860]   when you think of these two questions that I have up here,
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.860]   what is our greatest need?
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.860]   And what is our greatest desire?
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.860]   If you were to answer these two questions,
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.860]   what is our greatest need?
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.860]   And we would say, without blinking an eye,
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.860]   as quick as we can, that it is God that is our greatest need.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.860]   He is our greatest need.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.860]   And if we were to answer the second question,
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.860]   what is our greatest desire,
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.860]   then we would say God is our greatest desire.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.860]   God is supposed to be our greatest desire.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.860]   Both of these questions have already been answered for the Christian,
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.860]   and it's true to us, and we say amen to this,
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.860]   because God is our greatest need.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.860]   God is our greatest desire.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.860]   God is the only place, in effect,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:02.860]   where needs and wants really converge.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.860]   Needs and desires converge in this place with God,
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.860]   and this is where genuine worship is born.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.860]   It's the essence of worship.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.860]   When we cry out our need for God,
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.860]   when we cry out our desire for God,
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.860]   this is the place where God meets us,
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.860]   and it is His desire to give all of Himself to us.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.860]   It's this idea of abide that we've talked about.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.860]   In John chapter 15, verse 5, it says,
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.860]   "I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.860]   "He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:38.860]   "he bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.860]   "Just as the Father has loved me, I have also loved you.
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.860]   "Abide in my love.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.860]   "If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love,
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.860]   "just as I have kept my Father's commandments,
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:48.860]   "abide in His love.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.860]   "These things I have spoken to you so that my joy may be in you
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.860]   "and that your joy may be made full."
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.860]   All of this is going to be found in our communion with the Lord,
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.860]   that He is our desire, that He is our contentment,
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:08.860]   He is our need, He is everything that we can want and have.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.860]   Pastor Mark preached on that today.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.860]   We're joyful people because of this.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.860]   This passage shows us that all that we desire is found in God,
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.860]   that He is our heart's cry,
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.860]   and all of our needs have been met in God.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.860]   There is nothing else that can be done to us.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.860]   You can take away everything that we have.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.860]   You can take away our very lives.
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:36.860]   And as believers, we would communally say amen to that.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.860]   Tonight, I hope that we can remember that together.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.860]   J.I. Packer says, "We need to discover all over again
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.860]   "that worship is natural to the Christian,
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.860]   "as it was to the godly Israelites who wrote the Psalms,
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   "and that the habit of celebrating the greatness and graciousness of God
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:56.860]   "yields an endless flow of thankfulness, joy, and zeal."
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   So we're going to go through some discussion questions tonight,
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.860]   and I hope that you can be honest with these
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:08.860]   and ask yourself all throughout, "Am I a content child
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.860]   "who is happy because I have God,
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.860]   "who understands the great gift of salvation that has been given,
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.860]   "that Jesus Christ has been given,
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.860]   "and that then we are able to understand that God is not somebody
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.860]   "who keeps those things away.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.860]   "He will give every good gift.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   "He will not withhold anything good from us."
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   And so while many things ultimately is going to be realized in the kingdom,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:38.860]   that today, all that we have, events up and down, good or bad,
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.860]   are good gifts from our God, and so we can be joyful.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.860]   God loves a content child.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:49.860]   Hebrews 13.5 says, "Make sure that your character is free from the love of money,
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.860]   "being content with what you have.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.860]   "For he himself has said, 'I will never desert you,
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.860]   "'nor will I ever forsake you.'"
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.860]   Notice that he doesn't say here that he will give more money.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.860]   Although he can, he says, "I will never desert you.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   "I will never forsake you."
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   It's him.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.860]   Colossians 3.15 says, "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts,
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.860]   "to which indeed you are called in one body, and be thankful.
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.860]   "Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.860]   "giving thanks through him to God the Father."
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:24.860]   Our gratitude is going to be a testimony to the world.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.860]   To any unbeliever, our gratitude shows how precious God is.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.860]   If we are not content with God, if we are grumbling and complaining,
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.860]   it will mar our witness to the world.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:40.860]   We're called to be content people, and that's our light.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:45.860]   So I conclude with Psalm 23.1, and it's just the first part of this verse,
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:50.860]   where it says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.860]   That is our light.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.860]   It's not going around to people just preaching this.
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.860]   It's that this is our realized, true desire.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.860]   That I have nothing that I want.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.860]   There is nothing more that can be added to me,
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.860]   and nothing that can be taken away.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.860]   That is going to cause in me any kind of shifting.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:14.860]   And so when we are struggling and wrestling with these things,
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.860]   and we all are, that as we come together,
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.860]   and especially tonight as we discuss these things,
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   I hope that our hearts can come together in this kind of gratitude.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.860]   Reminding each other, pushing each other, regardless of wherever we are,
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   whether we're in a time of abounding or a time of need,
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.860]   that we're filled with joy.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.860]   I'll pray for us to close.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:40.860]   Heavenly Father, God, wherever we are here in Southern California,
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.860]   wherever we're gathered,
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   I pray that it is your people who are going to be raising worship to you,
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.860]   who are going to be reminding each other
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.860]   that we will remind each other of how great you are,
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.860]   how sweet you are, how good you are,
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.860]   that you are our shepherd and we have nothing that we want.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:06.860]   God, please, I know that we are so grumbling and complaining.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.860]   God, we look just like those Israelites.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.860]   Be gracious to us, Lord.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:17.860]   Open our eyes to see what a great gift we have in you.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:22.860]   Teach us again to open our mouths only to worship,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.860]   to give you glory and honor,
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.860]   and that your church then would be a great testimony, witness, and light
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:33.860]   to the incredible value and preciousness of the great God that we serve.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.860]   So thank you, Lord.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.860]   Thank you that you gave us tonight to be able to, with a smaller group,
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.860]   eat together, share together,
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.860]   and we pray for genuine fellowship and communion now.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.860]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.860]   There should be some discussion questions provided to everybody,
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.860]   so go ahead and go through that however the group see fit.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.860]   Other than that, that concludes tonight.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.860]   So we hope that you have an enjoyable rest of the night.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:08.860]   [applause]
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:14.860]   [silence]
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:18.860]   [silence]
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:24.860]   [silence]
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:30.860]   [silence]
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:36.860]   [silence]
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:42.860]   [silence]
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:48.860]   [silence]
