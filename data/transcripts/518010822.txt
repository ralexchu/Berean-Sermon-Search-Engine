[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11, we're going to be
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.700]   reading from verse 27 through 29.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.000]   So this is going to be the part two of what we started last week.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.760]   As we said, Moses has very clear, distinct divisions in his life with the first 40 years
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.780]   he was in the Pharaoh's house, the next 40 years he was out in the desert shepherding,
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.880]   and then the 40 years of wandering the desert as God used him to deliver the nation of Israel
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.200]   from Pharaoh.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.920]   So we're at the third part this week, and so we're going to be looking at what it says
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.240]   in verse 27 through 29.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.760]   By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured a seeing him who
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.320]   is unseen.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.000]   By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.320]   firstborn would not touch them.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.600]   By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.120]   and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.520]   Let's pray.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.480]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your continued grace.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.920]   We pray that the worship that we give you would truly be something meaningful in our
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.600]   hearts that we offer up to you, that we would worship you not simply with time, but our
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.760]   whole heart.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.440]   Help us, Lord, to know the significance of these words, that it may mold us, move us,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.320]   change us, Lord God, according to your purpose and will.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.840]   I think in the recent days, you know, most of you or many of you probably heard the story
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.080]   of what happened with Ravi Zacharias, and I know that it's affected the Christian world
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.640]   because he was a man that was celebrated and did many good works for decades.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.680]   And so if you don't know the story behind that, basically he's a man who God used for
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.480]   apologetics and wrote many good books and had seminars, and many, many people would
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.400]   credit him for bringing them to Christ, and recently found out after he passed away that
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.440]   he completely lived a double life, that he lived a life that was filled with sin, he
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.840]   was a sexual predator, and it was not simply a mistake, it looked like it was calculated,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.240]   and he didn't really seem like he made much attempt to cover it up.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.600]   You know, we have a tendency, like it says in Romans chapter 1, to put people on pedestals,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.640]   and it's not that the Bible does teach us to honor and to submit and to remember, and
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.840]   all those things are important, but at the same time, our primary sin that is mentioned
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.760]   in Romans chapter 1, we have a tendency to worship the creation rather than the creator,
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.320]   and sometimes we do that to the point where when somebody that we looked up to fails that
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.140]   way, it could really destroy people's faith when we do that.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.520]   No one is meant to be worshipped.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.080]   To honor, respected, yes, but not to be worshipped.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.740]   No one is to take the place where our faith is dependent upon another man.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.480]   We need to be careful that we, even as we study through the scripture, we have a tendency
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.040]   to highlight the achievements of man, even though we say in passing that God is sovereign
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.480]   and he does what he does, but we can look at what Moses did, we can look at what David
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.400]   did, and I've heard so many sermons about how David, you know, while he was shepherding,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.760]   and he, you know, he cleaned up his rocks and how he was, you know, chasing away wolves,
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.120]   and that was that skill that God needed to slay Goliath, and so we need to hone in our
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.060]   skills so that God can use us for his glory.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.460]   The point of the story is not that at all, right?
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.280]   We can get off track in our tendency to kind of highlight the achievements of man and the
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.360]   intellect of man and our, you know, our talents of man, then completely forget the point of
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   the whole story.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:16.460]   Moses, if you can put the picture up, the next slide.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.720]   When we think of Moses, this is usually the picture that we have, that's probably Charlton
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.800]   Heston, for those of you who know who he is, right?
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.360]   Hollywood, this story of Egypt's deliverance and the ten plagues, it's so prominent, especially
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.200]   in the American culture, most people know about this, Christian or non-Christian.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.320]   So Hollywood movies were made of it, and so when we think of Moses, we think of this strong
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.080]   confident, fearless leader that God used to deliver Israel.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.760]   In fact, that's how it starts in verse 1, it says, verse 27 says, "By faith he left
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.800]   Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured a seeing him who was unseen."
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.000]   Not fearing.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.200]   So he's described as a fearless man, and remember who he's going against, he's going against
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.880]   Pharaoh, the strongest, most powerful man who was basically the king of the most powerful
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.240]   nation.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.080]   And here's this shepherd who's been shepherding for 40 years, and God raises him up to challenge
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.840]   him, saying, "Let my people go."
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.920]   Think how audacious that is, that this shepherd for 40 years would stand in front of Pharaoh
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.320]   and demand, "Let my people go."
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.840]   And he said Moses was fearless when he did that, right?
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.720]   We could easily look at that and say, "Wow, you know, that's why he's celebrated, and
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.320]   that's why he's known as the greatest leader of Israel, and we need to emulate him."
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.840]   But if you look carefully at the word of God, it doesn't present himself that way.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.740]   In fact, if you remember in Acts 7, 24 to 20, in verse 25, Stephen gives the sermon
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.200]   about that particular event when he is chased out of Egypt out of fear.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.680]   If you remember, he came out and he saw a dispute, and the Egyptians, Egyptian guard,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.840]   and in order to protect his Hebrew brother, he ends up killing him.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.560]   He comes out a second time, thinking that maybe God was going to use him to deliver
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.960]   Israel in verse 25, it says, "And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.000]   granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.760]   So he came out thinking, because he grew up all his life with prophecy that he was the
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.280]   chosen one, and that's why he was in Pharaoh's house.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   That's why God was raising him up.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.880]   And finally, when he came out and he confronted the Egyptian guard, and he came out and was
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.920]   trying to intervene in the dispute of these two Hebrews, I think he thought that that
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.440]   was the time that God was going to use him to deliver.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.360]   Just like the prophecy, just like he was told since he was a child.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.640]   But when they turn against him and say, "Are you going to kill us too?
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.760]   Who are you?"
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.160]   It says in verse 14, Exodus 2, 14, but he said, "Who made you a prince or judge over
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   us?
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.080]   Are you going to kill me as you killed the Egyptians?"
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.600]   Then Moses was afraid and said, "Surely the matter has become known."
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.800]   Well, who wrote this?
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.960]   Because in 27, he says he's fearless, and then here it says he was afraid.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.760]   In Exodus 3, 10 through 11, after spending 40 years on the desert, God finally calls
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.040]   him, tells him who he is, and says, "Now is the time.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.040]   I want you to go."
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.760]   And then this is how Moses responds in verse 10.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.280]   "Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh so that you may bring my people,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.760]   the sons of Israel, out of Egypt."
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.040]   But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.840]   sons of Israel out of Egypt?"
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.320]   Remember 40 years ago, he was willing, and he was expecting because he grew up all his
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.940]   life with that prophecy over him.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:55.940]   But now it's not because he's ignorant, it's because it failed, at least in his mind.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.240]   So why is it going to happen this way?
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.100]   Who am I?
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.560]   He doesn't seem like a man of faith, at least not here, right?
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.920]   He doesn't seem like a courageous man that, you know, with the staff up in the sky, this
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.120]   fearless leader that Israelites was able to get behind.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.080]   Exodus chapter 4, 1, Moses said, "What if they will not believe me or listen to what
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   I say?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.760]   For they may say, 'The Lord has not appeared to you.'"
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.120]   And then again, in Exodus 4, 10 through 15, God keeps on pushing him.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.240]   "I didn't call you because you are articulate.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.960]   I didn't call you because I needed you.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.400]   I called you because I called you."
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.560]   Then Moses said to the Lord, "Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.320]   nor the time passed, nor since you have spoken to your servant, for I am slow of speech and
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.600]   slow of tongue."
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:50.560]   "Please, Lord," he's begging, and the Lord won't let it go because God anointed him.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.960]   He genuinely doesn't want to do this because he was fearful.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   Who am I?
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.240]   I mean, think about that.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.000]   He's talking to God.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.760]   He's not just talking to anybody.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.880]   God is audibly speaking to Moses, saying that, "I'm going to use you," and he says, "Well,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.440]   who am I?"
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:17.840]   Verse 12, "Now then, go, and I even will be with your mouth and teach you what you are
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   to say."
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.080]   But he said, "Please, Lord, now send a message by whomever you will."
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.960]   Then the anger of the Lord burned against Moses.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.880]   Does that sound like the fearless leader that you see in verse 27?
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.440]   Now what happened?
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.760]   And who wrote Exodus?
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.240]   Moses did.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   And I know that he was dictating by the Holy Spirit, but Moses was writing this, and as
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.440]   he was writing this, did he just get it wrong?
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.120]   Whoever wrote Hebrews, did they not read Exodus?
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.360]   Maybe these are two separate authors, and they don't know anything about each other,
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.640]   and so one describes him as this fearful man who had very little faith and was begging
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.240]   God, "Please don't let me do it."
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.060]   That's how it's described for us.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:13.120]   And then in Exodus 5, 21 to 23, when he finally goes, literally, God is twisting his arms,
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.520]   like, "You better go."
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.400]   "I made your mouth.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   You go."
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.320]   And then he goes, and then they had the first encounter, and Pharaoh's heart gets hardened.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.640]   It says God keeps hardening his heart because he wanted to demonstrate his power.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.520]   And then the Israelites do the same thing.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.520]   They turn against Moses and say, "I told you.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.000]   Because of you, Pharaoh is making it harder on us."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.760]   And so in 5, 21, it says that they said to them, "May the Lord look upon you and judge
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.040]   you, for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants, to
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.240]   put a sword in their hand to kill us."
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.160]   So it didn't turn out the way, just like the first time.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.360]   They didn't embrace him.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.000]   They didn't celebrate him.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.440]   So he goes back to God in verse 22, "Then Moses returned to the Lord and said, 'O Lord,
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.840]   why have you brought harm to this people?
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.000]   Why did you ever send me?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.680]   Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done harm to this people, and
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.720]   you have not delivered your people at all.'"
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.640]   And he still lived.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.920]   He's saying this all to God.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.000]   God appears to him, and he's complaining to God.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.600]   At this point, he's more afraid of the Israelites.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.400]   He's more afraid of Pharaoh than God himself.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.480]   Does that sound like verse 27, "By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king"?
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.280]   It sure sounds like he was fearful of the wrath.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.200]   He was fearful not only of the wrath, but of their opinion.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.440]   It says 611-12, "Go tell Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to let the sons of Israel go out of
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.640]   this land.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.560]   But Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, 'Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.160]   How then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am unskilled in speech?'"
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.360]   So is that that guy on the staff?
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.460]   Would you draw him based upon this text?
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.840]   Would you draw that guy?
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.000]   That's the guy?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:14.320]   Maybe next time somebody draws Moses, he would be like, "Please, please, don't let me do
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   it."
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:21.800]   Because that's the way it's presented to us in Exodus.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.240]   Moses is not painted this way.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.160]   In fact, remember we said Moses is described as the humblest man on earth.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160]   It's like, "Oh, it's a humble brag.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.120]   I'm the humblest of the universe."
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.440]   I genuinely think he meant that.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.640]   And what he meant by that was he was humbled.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.520]   He was afraid.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.200]   He was scared.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.280]   He was resistant, maybe even disobedient.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.360]   And I think that's what he meant.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   Because he saw that.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.760]   He encountered God and he's arguing with God.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.680]   Will you really deliver?
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.240]   Is this really going to happen?
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.700]   How can you, somebody like me, even as God was showing him miracles, he was doubting
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:10.240]   and questioning.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.080]   But why does it have in verse 27 that he was not fearing the wrath of God?
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.860]   At some point in this deliverance story, Moses does get courage.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.780]   At some point, Moses becomes that deliverer.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.520]   And at some point, he is that man who raised up the staff and God uses him.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.720]   But that's not how it started.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.200]   He was not fearful.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:42.520]   And the description of what happened, it just says simply, he says, "He saw the unseen God."
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520]   That's what it says.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.560]   That's all it says.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.560]   He endured.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.560]   Right?
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.760]   Meaning, like, he did what God told him to do.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.680]   He endured.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.000]   And seeing him who is unseen.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.400]   And that's it.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   That's what changed him.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.240]   You know, I've heard so many stories about how God used him in 40 years and built up
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.640]   courage and trained him and spoke to him.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.840]   And so he became this man of God when he showed up.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.600]   And that's why he took him out into the wilderness.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:13.120]   And that's our tendency to elevate man's work.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.160]   That if we just do this, if we said this, and if we did that, and if we had the right
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.840]   people and the right money with the right training, we can get the right things done.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.560]   That's our natural tendency to think we just elevate man's work and forget that what happened
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:34.520]   here with Moses was simply, here's a weak man who was fearful, who encountered the living
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.280]   God.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:43.920]   What changed him was not years of discipling, years of training, years of discipline.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.380]   He met the right people, did the right things with the right program.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.480]   He just encountered God.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.640]   And so when he's at the burning bush, he's like, "Well, if I go, what do I tell them?"
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.200]   Exodus 3, 14, God said, "I am who I am."
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.800]   He says, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I am has sent me to you.'"
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.640]   I am.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.840]   I don't come from anybody else.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   I'm not created.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.720]   He is self-existing, self-reliant, omnipotent, all-powerful.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.880]   Tell him Yahweh has sent you.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.080]   And all he tells him is, "I will be with you."
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.120]   Now, remember, this is Pharaoh.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.960]   Other kings would be terrified to go to Pharaoh.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.840]   The strongest of men would be terrified to be in the presence of Pharaoh.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.080]   So humanly speaking, we can understand why he was terrified.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.080]   But the only strength that he gives him, only comfort that he gives him is that when you
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.040]   go, "I will be with you."
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   I will be with you.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.840]   He doesn't say, "Here's a list of things to memorize and make sure you say this."
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   When he does this, do this.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.920]   He doesn't say, "No, I will be with you.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.920]   Just go.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.040]   When I say to speak, you speak.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.560]   When I say to do this, you do this.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560]   Just go."
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:09.120]   You know, we think about the Great Commission in Matthew 28 where God is sending out his
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.960]   disciples and we have so many people have memorized that passage.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.120]   Go make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and the
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.160]   Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I've commanded you.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.680]   But the real power behind the Great Commission is what comes before and what comes after.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.360]   So we have a tendency to memorize scripture.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.080]   We got to go.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   What is our strategy?
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   What is our five-year vision?
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.420]   What is our 10-year vision?
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.160]   What is our discipleship program?
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   How are we going to raise up leaders?
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.920]   And we have all of these great programs.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:46.360]   And there's nothing wrong with any of that, but we pour our energy into human ingenuity.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.800]   But the real power behind that is prior to him saying, "All authority in heaven and
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.040]   on earth has been given to me.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.800]   So therefore, go."
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.200]   And then he says at the end, what did he say?
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.120]   "Lo, I am with you to the end of the age."
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.600]   So the power behind the Great Commission is his authority and his presence with us, not
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.840]   our ingenuity.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.160]   That's why in Acts 1-8, when the disciples were ready to go, he said, "Don't go, because
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.800]   you don't have the power.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.480]   When the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will have power, and you will be my witnesses in
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.880]   Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the end of the age."
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.880]   And God prepared people to go.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.640]   Everywhere Apostle Paul went, those people who were at Pentecost, in fear of persecution,
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.320]   as they were running, they were sharing the gospel.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.440]   So when Apostle Paul started his journey going to these places, these Christians were already
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.360]   there, already sharing their testimonies.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.880]   That didn't happen because of great planning or discipleship.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.220]   They were running in fear of their life, and God was planting seeds already by his power,
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.520]   because that's what he said he was going to do.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:58.640]   Our natural tendency is if a church is successful there, if that man seems to be bearing fruit,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.360]   we go and take notes and do what he did.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.860]   Because we think if we copy what they're doing, we can have the same success.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.620]   And so people write books and seminars, "This is what we did.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.620]   This is how we teach.
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.200]   This is how our program.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.960]   This is what we do."
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:22.720]   And then people just copy that, and then we regurgitate what that man is doing, and then
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.640]   we just happen to do it here.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.200]   Because that's our natural tendency, to worship the creation rather than the creator.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.400]   Jesus' fearlessness did not come because of great training.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.920]   If anything, for 40 years out in the desert, what do you think he learned?
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.320]   40 years.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   What part of the...
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.160]   Humanly speaking, you could say, "Well, God's raising up to be this great leader, so he
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.360]   learned this by shepherding sheep.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.760]   He learned this by attacking wolves, and God used that.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.800]   Because when he went against Pharaoh, Pharaoh was the wolf."
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.920]   Foolish.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.680]   What was he doing for 40 years?
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   Moses came out.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.520]   Remember, before he went out to the desert, he came out like the ruler.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.520]   He came out.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.440]   He even killed an Egyptian, and he thought, "They're going to come behind me.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.020]   Now God's going to raise me up."
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.200]   And then he throws him out to the desert for 40 years.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.440]   What do you think he learned for 40 years?
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.280]   Shepherds were the lowliest of profession.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.440]   He went from the highest to the lowest.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.840]   If there's anything that he learned in the 40 years, to empty himself.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.400]   He got humbled.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.560]   He got humbled.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.680]   And that's why the Bible says, "If you want to be used for noble purposes," what does
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.000]   the Bible tell us in Timothy?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.600]   To get rid of ignoble things.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.200]   He doesn't say fill yourself, right?
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.560]   Like read a lot of books.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.600]   There's nothing with any of that, okay?
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.720]   But that's not where the power is.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   Our natural tendency to think, if we get the right people doing the right thing, that God's
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.600]   going to bless it.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.520]   But all we're commanded to do is to be emptied.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.800]   The greatest hindrance to the work of God is not that we don't have the right people
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:26.600]   in the right place, it's typically we have the wrong people in the wrong place, or sometimes
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.480]   wrong people in the right place.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.320]   It's ourselves, we get in the way.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.840]   That's why if you look at John 15, when it says, "You can't bear fruit unless you abide
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.840]   in me."
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.200]   And then you know why it's so important to abide?
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.440]   Verse 7, "Because if you abide in me," my words abide in you, "ask whatever you wish,
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.520]   he will do it."
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   That's why he says to abide, right?
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.480]   Not so that you can be this prayer warrior and I'm going to do mighty things, because
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:03.800]   when you abide, if you abide in him, his word abides in you, you have more effective prayer.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   That's what he says.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.320]   So the power is not in our abiding, it's in our abiding we have more effective prayer,
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.000]   like God will do it.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.360]   See, his power came simply because he saw God.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:26.240]   And even the 10 plagues was to demonstrate to Israel and to demonstrate to Egypt who
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.720]   God really is.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.120]   He didn't just say, "I am who I am," he was going to show them.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.080]   He was going to show them that God is above every God.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:43.040]   So every one of these plagues, the Nile turning into blood, the God of ISIS was one of their
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.080]   goddesses that was a god of the Nile, and he turns it into blood.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:53.120]   The frog, Hekt, the Egyptian goddess whose head was the frog.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.640]   Nat, the god that they worshiped.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.480]   Geb, god of dust and the earth.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.760]   Fly, Kepri, the god and the...it was the head of a beetle.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:09.240]   Sick cattle, Hathor, is the goddess of fertility.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.120]   The boils, again, the goddess of health, ISIS.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   Hail, Nut, the goddess of the sky and the goddess of the air.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.360]   Locust, Neper, Nepri, god and goddess of grain.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.720]   Darkness, their greatest god that they worshiped.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.840]   Ra, the god of the sun, the most revered.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:34.960]   Every one of these was a power encounter, not only to show Egypt who it is that's delivering
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:42.200]   Israel, but these Israelites for 400 years who fell into despair.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.240]   It's almost like they've kind of accepted the fact that they were slaves.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.520]   And when Moses tried to...God used him to deliver them and it didn't happen right away,
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.920]   He said, "It's better for us."
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.240]   Remember, every time it got hard out in the desert, even at the Red Sea, they kept saying,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.120]   "Oh, if we went back there, I knew we were slaves, but at least over there we had food
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.600]   and we had water and we had safety."
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.040]   So 400 years, they've accepted their identity.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:14.400]   And so God was coming in, having a power encounter with them to show them who He is.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.620]   Moses at some point in this process began to see and began to believe.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.720]   He lost all faith in himself and maybe he lost some faith in God during that time and
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.520]   God was rebuilding him up.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:42.280]   So this man who was afraid, this man who was terrified, timid, becomes this mighty soldier
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.840]   that God uses to deliver.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.480]   You know, the Bible talks about how, you know, if you have a faith of a mustard seed, you
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.800]   can move mountains.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.080]   That's exactly what happened, right?
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:24:00.680]   Moses, this man of tiny faith, like literally begging God, "Please don't let me go.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   Please."
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   That guy, right?
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.240]   "They didn't listen to me before.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.640]   Why are they going to listen to me now?"
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.660]   Even as he is seeing the miracle, it kind of needed time to build.
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:19.740]   That guy with that tiny faith, God moved Pharaoh.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.800]   Exactly what he said he was going to do, simply because he saw God.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.880]   Hebrews chapter 12, 20 to 21 describes Moses seeing God at Mount Sinai this way, "For
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:36.080]   they could not bear the command, 'If even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.'
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:43.040]   And so terrible is the sight that Moses said, 'I am full of fear and trembling.'"
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.080]   Fear of God.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.540]   He met God, and he realized who God was, and instead of fearing Pharaoh, instead of
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:55.060]   fearing the opinions of the Israelites, it's that he feared God.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:04.140]   The great theologian Kanye West says, they asked him, those of you guys who know Kanye
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.820]   West is, right?
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.780]   They asked him, "Aren't you afraid of the cancel culture?
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.180]   You know, things that you say, and the Christian things that you say, and Jesus is Lord?"
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.020]   And he said, "I don't fear that because I fear God."
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:25.300]   He said, "Fear of God overcomes all other fears."
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.300]   Kanye West.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:32.220]   Out of mouth of babes.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.660]   Proverbs 9, 10 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.300]   of the Holy One is understanding."
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:47.740]   Beginning of wisdom is when we are emptied of our self-confidence, when we're done with
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:54.580]   our ingenuity, when we've reached the end of the possibility that we have, our potential,
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.580]   when we've reached the end of all of that, and you have no other hope but to turn to
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.060]   God, and you fear God.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.020]   He said, "That's the beginning of wisdom."
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:13.500]   The greatest hindrance to our fruitfulness is not our circumstance.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.620]   It's us.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:23.820]   Us thinking that us get together, and if we have enough of us, and if we have the right
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:30.980]   techniques from us, that God's going to magnify us.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.740]   That's what gets in the way.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.300]   I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:44.220]   And the way that we use that is, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.220]   me."
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:52.600]   When it's really meant, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.820]   Our natural tendency is to worship the creation rather than the creator.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:05.900]   He changed, and his fear was overcome by a greater fear of God, because he saw what was
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.900]   unseen.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.300]   You know, whenever we do inductive Bible study, we have to ask good questions, right?
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:18.580]   And so the question that we ask is, verse 28 and 29, so he said, "By faith he left
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.140]   Egypt and he was not afraid of Pharaoh because he saw God."
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.320]   And then there's two particular events that are highlighted.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   So we have to ask, "Why are those two things highlighted?
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   How come the other events are not highlighted?"
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   Right?
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.680]   I mean, he said, "There's 10 plagues, not one."
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.880]   So many things happened, but why are these two particular events highlighted saying that
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.700]   this demonstrated the faith of Moses?
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.640]   The first one is pretty obvious because it says, "By faith he kept the Passover and
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.040]   the sprinkling of the blood so that he destroyed the firstborn would not touch them."
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.280]   So we know the Passover.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:56.300]   Every time we have a communion, we celebrate that because Jesus fulfills that.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.040]   You know what's interesting about that is their top God was the God Ra.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:08.640]   And some of you guys may know from maybe watching National Geography.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   I'm butchering that.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.640]   I forget what that is.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.640]   National Geography.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.220]   Okay, so you've probably seen pictures, right?
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.520]   And that's the one that kind of looks like a dog, right?
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.560]   And that was the top God that they worshiped.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:30.620]   And as they worshiped that, it was understood that Ra owned all of the firstborn children
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.640]   of Egypt.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   It was dedicated.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:39.120]   If you had your firstborn, it was dedicated to Ra for the service of Ra.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.960]   So you can see why God, his final and the most powerful power encounter with Egypt was
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.240]   to challenge Ra.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.920]   That he was going to come, the angel of death was going to come and destroy all the firstborn,
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.360]   but the only ones that would survive are the ones that by faith covered their doorpost
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.560]   with the lamb's blood.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.960]   And so that was the power encounter.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.380]   That was the final and the greatest challenge to the nation of Egypt.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:11.160]   And for Israel to realize that there's only one true God.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:16.840]   But the second reason is pretty clear because that obviously pointed to the coming of Christ.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.860]   And as soon as that happened, God told the nation of Israel that you do this every single
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.360]   year to celebrate this Passover meal.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.200]   To remember the way that God delivered you.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.560]   Clearly pointing to the coming of Christ, the blood of the lamb is going to cover our
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.940]   sins and the angel of death is going to go over us and we will be saved.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.280]   Those of you who participate in the Passover meal, there's a part of the meal where you
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.200]   take the three pieces of matzah and you take the middle one and you hide it away for a
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.840]   while and at the end of the meal you bring it back and you break it and give it to each
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.960]   of the members at the table and your family.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.800]   They said that the Israelites, the Jewish people to this day practice that, but when
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.340]   you ask them exactly what the meaning behind that, they don't know.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.680]   They lost it.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   That was practiced in the first century when Jesus was practicing it.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:12.840]   So if you look at the text when Jesus is practicing the Passover meal, he takes the bread, which
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.520]   would have been the second one, they hid away for a while and brought back, broke it and
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.520]   gave it to them and Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.920]   I mean it's pretty clear that that second is Jesus Christ, the second and the third
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.320]   person of the Trinity that's crucified for three days and buried and come back to life.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.400]   I mean we see that very clearly, but they practice this every year without knowing the
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.400]   significance.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.240]   We don't know why the Passover is chosen because it is the clearest picture about his
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.960]   death and his atonement over us.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.880]   But why the deliverance from the Red Sea?
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:58.000]   In fact, the deliverance of the Red Sea is so dramatic that this event is recorded in
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.520]   Psalm 66, 68, 13, 106, 9, 136, 13 and is repeated over and over again.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.960]   In fact, Moses breaks out into this song in Exodus 15, 1-13, "I will sing to the Lord
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.880]   for he is highly exalted, the horse and the riders he has hurled into the sea.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.000]   The Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.960]   This is my God and I will praise him, my Father's God, and I will extol him."
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.880]   Why is this event particularly highlighted?
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:34.160]   You know as I was wrestling through that question myself, I began to see so many similarities
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.560]   of what God was doing.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:41.000]   Remember in the book of Hebrews it says the tabernacle is a shadow of the reality to come
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.280]   in Christ.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.200]   But it wasn't just the tabernacle.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.580]   The whole nation of Israel, the Feast of Booth, the Passover, all of the feasts that God gave
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:57.120]   the nation of Israel pointed to something that was going to be found in Christ.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.800]   So let me ask you, right?
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.400]   How many years were the Israelites in bondage?
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.160]   Four hundred years, right?
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.480]   How many years gap was there between the Old and the New Testament where there were no
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.040]   prophets, where it says that God was silent during that period?
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.680]   Four hundred years, okay?
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:24.700]   So during those four hundred years God wasn't speaking and Israelites fell into despair because
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.060]   the prophet wasn't coming.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.180]   God wasn't speaking to them.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.920]   And so they began to kind of fall into different categories.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   Like, well what are we going to do?
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.200]   What are we going to do?
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.080]   So they broke up into Pharisees and they broke up into Sadducees, the Essenes, and you know,
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.880]   and the Zealots, all trying to by their own strength and by their own might.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.560]   Some became a little bit more religious.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.740]   Some became more political.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.040]   Some decided to just walk out to the desert.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.820]   And then some picked up arms, right?
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.120]   And got militant.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.880]   But it was all their effort to fulfill what they wanted.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:07.260]   Well, four hundred years while they were in bondage, the Israelites fell into despair
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.780]   because God didn't deliver.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:17.420]   You know, remember when they walked into Egypt, they came in as Joseph's second man.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.240]   And they were protected by Pharaoh.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:26.320]   But at some point, the new Pharaoh comes and they forget and they turn into slaves and
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.240]   they've been crying out and it took too long.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.520]   But right in the middle of their despair, God shows up and delivers them.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:40.600]   And clearly, the Passover is what God used to deliver both Egypt and the New Covenant
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.280]   people.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:49.320]   But if you look at the Red Sea, when does the inauguration of the church, the New Covenant
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.280]   people begin?
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.080]   Acts chapter 2.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:57.040]   The Holy Spirit comes and he enters into the people.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.720]   They begin to speak in tongues in various languages.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.960]   And that was the inauguration of the New Covenant and new people.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:12.480]   Well, Israelites, them exiting Egypt and coming into the New Promised Land on the other side
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.960]   of this Red Sea, they become the people of God.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.200]   They were Israelites by descendants, but the political Israel, the national Israel happens
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.600]   on the other side of Red Sea.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.800]   And at the Pentecost, you see, when the Holy Spirit comes, it says there was a violent
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.560]   wind that came.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:37.000]   In the Red Sea, it says that the wind began to swirl and started to divide.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.280]   And so they were crossed from one kingdom, kingdom of Egypt, to a new kingdom, the kingdom
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.780]   of God.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   And that's what happens at the Pentecost.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:53.180]   The people of the Old Covenant, by the Holy Spirit, becomes the people of the New Covenant.
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:59.300]   Now you can say I'm milking it, but these are things that I see that clearly point to
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:07.900]   God's people being delivered by the blood of Christ and then inaugurating a new kingdom
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   on the other side.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.300]   Now, why is it significant?
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:17.620]   Because every part of this points to the sovereignty of God.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.500]   Every part of this is God's plan.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.380]   Every part of it, even the things that we understand, things that we don't understand,
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:32.180]   God has been orchestrating in details of what was going to happen.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.900]   So God is in complete control.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:41.380]   Moses was just a weak man that encountered a great God.
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:47.180]   Anytime we put a man on a pedestal and our faith depends on that man, and when that man
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.980]   fails, we fail along with him.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:56.020]   Because we have a tendency to worship the creation rather than the creator.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.860]   No man is to be in that slot.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.740]   It doesn't mean that we don't honor.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.380]   It doesn't mean we don't respect.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:07.620]   God says to submit to the elders of the church, but no man stands in the position where only
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.300]   God stands.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.980]   Our faith should not fail because a weak man failed.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:25.140]   Your faith should not be shaken because a fallen man happens to demonstrate his fallenness.
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.620]   Our faith is on solid ground.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:35.340]   Christ and Christ alone is our foundation.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:44.780]   So as we study and as we go through the history of Israel, if we look at that and we see,
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.900]   "Wow, Moses was a great man.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.100]   What did he do?
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.460]   He shepherded that we need to hone in our skills.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.780]   David, he became a huge, he became an expert rock thrower, so we need to shine our rocks
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.980]   and make sure that we do this."
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.980]   You missed the whole point.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.060]   The whole point of that is why does he choose the lesser over the greater?
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:10.080]   Why didn't he choose the Sadducees?
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.140]   Why didn't he choose the rich?
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.580]   Why did he get a bunch of fishermen who know nothing about the law?
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.740]   They weren't trained at the temple.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:24.520]   Why did he get a bunch of people who hated each other, the tax collector, like in zealots
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.480]   on the same team?
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:31.780]   Why did he choose the weak to dumbfound the wise?
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.740]   Wouldn't it be easier to get the wiser to dumbfound the wise?
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.740]   If you're going to go over power, wouldn't you get something more powerful?
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.900]   Why does he choose the foolish?
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.500]   Why does he choose the dumb?
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.900]   That's not my language, the Bible, right?
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.580]   So that you and I would recognize that it's not us.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.580]   It's him.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.700]   It's God.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.100]   It's always God.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.180]   So that our faith would not rest in man, but on God.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:10.460]   That's why Apostle Paul, with all of his wisdom and knowledge and training, he says, "I resolve
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.420]   to know nothing but Christ crucified."
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:18.100]   Because the power is not in me, it's not in you, it's not in our system, it's not in our
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:22.940]   experience, it's not in our age, it's not in our knowledge, it's not in our determination,
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.020]   it's not in our discipline, it's not in our organization.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.820]   It's in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:35.540]   So if there's anything that we need to be striving week after week, it's to see God.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.940]   We don't study the Bible so that we can be experts in the Bible, we study the Bible so
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.440]   that we can see God.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.420]   We don't pray so that we can say we prayed one hour, two hour, three hour, we pray so
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.980]   that we can encounter God.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:52.780]   We don't come to worship because we have greater music, we come to worship so that we can encounter
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.540]   God.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:01.300]   Because the only power to change the world is God.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:06.820]   To think that somehow, that if I'm articulate enough, if I'm smart enough, if I'm organized
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:12.740]   enough, if I'm disciplined enough, I can bring somebody who's going to hell to give up their
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.540]   lives and follow Jesus Christ.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.940]   The arrogance of that statement.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:25.020]   If you can do that by honing your skill, you should be the richest man on earth.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:30.580]   If you can get somebody to abandon the world and to follow Jesus Christ by your skill,
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:36.740]   by your knowledge, by your will, then you can sell anything.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.380]   You should be a multi-billionaire.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.180]   The arrogance of that.
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.700]   We are the strongest when?
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.140]   When we are the weakest.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:53.300]   When we are weak, He is strong.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:40:00.220]   So if we learn anything through Israel's history, that we recognize not these men, but the God
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:07.260]   behind these men, that we may worship Him and build our life upon the rock of Christ.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.780]   Let's pray.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:18.500]   Let's take a few minutes as our worship team comes up to lead us in prayer, to take some
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:24.060]   time to really ask the Lord and ask yourselves, when was the last time you could say you've
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:29.420]   genuinely encountered Christ?
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:35.940]   I'm not asking like, did you check off that I read the Bible, I prayed, and I did my homework,
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.420]   and I gave, and I served.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.820]   But that's not the question I'm asking.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:47.540]   When was the last time you really felt like God was hearing your prayers?
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.740]   You encountered God, and you got courage because of that.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:56.460]   That you were willing to forsake whatever you were tempted by because the fear of God,
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:01.700]   the love for Christ, was much bigger than anything else that was tempting you.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.780]   When was the last time you encountered this God?
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.340]   Maybe the thing that we should be striving for now, more than anything else, is to come
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:21.700]   before the Lord and seek Him, ask Him, knock, and to honestly pray.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.900]   I believe, help my unbelief.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.020]   I don't have the power within myself.
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.020]   I need you.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.500]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
