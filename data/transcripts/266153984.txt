[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The uncleanness of woman after she gives birth.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Okay, so that's what we're going to talk about.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   All right, so obviously this is one of those subjects,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   if I was giving topical Bible studies, that we would avoid the rest of my life.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   But we are going through it chapter by chapter.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And I'm sure you probably had very significant questions about what's going on here.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And we'll try to address it to the best of our ability.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   So let me pray first and then we'll jump in.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this evening
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   and bringing our brothers and sisters here together.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   That we may focus our attention, our mind, our hearts toward your word.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Help us to understand the hidden treasures, Lord God, of your word.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   That we may have better insight as to who you are and what you are doing.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   We pray for wisdom. Help us to not to go beyond your words.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Help us to dig and to find, Lord God, the mystery that is hidden in all of these things, Lord,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   which is ultimately revealed in you.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So we pray for your blessing and your Holy Spirit to guide.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Alright, so when you studied this, my guess is that you had one of the bigger questions
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   that you came up with is why is the woman unclean twice?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Why is she considered unclean for twice as long as when she has a male son?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Correct?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yes.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Okay, so you had that question. Okay.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I think even before we get to that question, we have to answer even a bigger question.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And that bigger question is why is she unclean in the first place?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Before we even get to the question of male or female, why is she unclean?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Because if you think about, if there's any time for a woman that we would consider our culture to be sacred
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   is when she gives birth.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Correct?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah, I mean that's a, you know, if you've ever been in the hospital or if your father or, you know,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   have brother or sisters and you go to the hospital and if there's any period where you think
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   the highlight of a woman, you know, and her sacredness, you think when she gives birth.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   But instead you take this sacred period after she gives birth, the time of recuperation,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and the scripture says she's unclean.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So the bigger question, even before we get to the male and female, is why is she considered unclean
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   to begin with when something so sacred and so precious of delivering a child after going through
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   such just pain and to experience something so beautiful as delivering a child.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And then as soon as the baby comes out, the Bible says that anybody that she touches becomes unclean.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   She's not allowed to come to the temple.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And then again, so we get to that distinction between male and female.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So that's a really a bigger question.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Why is she considered unclean to begin with?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So let's see if we can do our best to try to answer this question.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So Leviticus 11 dealt with the clean and unclean food, which was meat,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   different kinds of food that we're able to eat.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But this and subsequent chapters address clean and unclean people.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So up to this point, the main point of it was about addressing what you can and cannot eat.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But chapter 12 through 15 is addressing clean and unclean people.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   What makes people clean? What makes people unclean?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   So chapter 12, obviously today is what we're going to tackle, is the ritual of defilement that follows childbirth,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   which is again a huge question.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Why is this time that's so sacred to--and it's not just our culture, it's everywhere else in the world,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   delivering a child is sacred, but again, today we're going to be talking about the uncleanness of that.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And then chapter 13 and 14 deal with uncleanness caused by skin disease.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And which skin disease is he referring to specifically?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Leprosy.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So we'll get to that in the next couple weeks.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And then chapter 15 deals with uncleanness associated with reproduction,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   including the women's monthly cycle, another topic that I'm very eager to get to.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So we have the 15.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So that's kind of like the outline.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And just to kind of give a heads up, the purity laws identify life's brokenness due to human sinfulness,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   while holiness laws identify sins like sexual immorality.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So again, I want you to understand the distinction between the uncleanness versus unholy.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And we'll get to that when we talk about it. Uncleanness and unholy.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And those are two completely different things.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Unholiness is referring specifically to a violation that's a moral violation of some sort of law, right,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   that causes him to sin.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Unclean doesn't necessarily mean that you've sinned.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It's just that in God's eyes, it is not pure.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So as we are going along, I'm going to make sure that we make that distinction.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Unclean does not mean that they violated a particular law, willfully sinned,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and therefore they needed to find atonement.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   But it's just that in God's eyes, it is not pure.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So this is the general outline of the next four or five chapters.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Remember we talked about the kiastic outline, where it begins with the point,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and then it kind of has sub-points, and then where's the highlight in the kiastic?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   In the middle. And then it repeats the same outline in a reverse order.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So starting from chapter 12 to chapter 15, we have the reproduction, discharge, the childbirth,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and then the leprosy laws, right, in chapter 13.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And then chapter 14 talks about how to heal, how to deal with that.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And then in reverse order, chapter 14, the second part of it,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   leprosy laws and how it pertains to the house, how to clean the house.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And then finally, in chapter 15, it talks about, again, reproduction discharges,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   meaning having sexual relations, right, and then the woman's monthly flow.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So it kind of has a kiastic order, just to kind of keep the line in mind.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And then the main point of it, so as we are studying it,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   the main point that, not that there isn't points in each of these chapters,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   but again, just like the whole book of Leviticus, it's in the kiastic form.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And what is at the center of this kiastic form in the whole book of Leviticus?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Chapter, what chapter? What is at the center?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   The Day of Atonement, which is chapter 16, right?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So we're getting to that.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   So before we get to the main point of the whole book of Leviticus,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   in this chapter 12 through 15, we're getting to the main point of this section,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   which is restoration and healing, right?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And in a sense, what is the Day of Atonement?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Restoration and healing, right?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But this is talking about very practically, specifically,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   that when these things happen, how to be restored and to get unto God.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So in another sense, what he's going to be talking about in this kiastic outline
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   in the beginning of chapter 14 is a subplot of the Day of Atonement.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Where sin is revealed, and then it talks about how to remedy this sin.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Yes?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   So this is kind of like a microcosm of what is happening in the larger book of Leviticus.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   That's the kiastic form. So we'll get to that when we get to that.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   So the law that is given, and then we'll talk about the meaning behind it.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   So first of all, a woman who has just delivered a baby is considered unclean
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   for seven days if the baby is a boy, and 14 days if the baby is a girl.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   If it is a boy, baby boy, he's to be circumcised on the eighth day,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   after the seventh day of purification.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Just in case you were wondering why God waited eight days before a Jewish child was circumcised,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   it was because for seven days she was considered unclean.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So as soon as that period is done, he would get circumcised on the eighth day.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Circumcision was a mark of God's covenant people, commanded to Abraham and his descendants,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   again in Genesis 17, 10-14. So every Jewish male was to be circumcised.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Was circumcision unique to the nation of Israel?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   No. Other nations did get circumcised, so it wasn't like the nation of Israel
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   were the first group to ever circumcise their children.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It was the first group commanded by their religion to be circumcised.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Now why did God choose circumcision? It doesn't explain.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   One thing we do know about circumcision is that it was a blood covenant,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   so the spilling of the blood in the child was part of him coming into the covenant community,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   the spilling of the blood. I think, again, this is not explained in the scripture,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   but another reason maybe is one of the big promises that God made to the nation of Israel
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   is that they would be fruitful. They were going to multiply in great numbers,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   that they were going to be able to have many children and be able to be reproduced rapidly.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And so if you remember, when they were coming out of Egypt,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   remember what the Jewish women were known for?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   They delivered so quick, boom, boom, boom. That's what they were known for.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   The Jewish women had very healthy babies in delivery,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   and so when Pharaoh wanted to kill the firstborn children, they couldn't get to them fast enough.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   But that was a very specific blessing that God gave the nation of Israel.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   So the fact that the circumcision is a covenant symbol, one is shedding of blood,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   second is very specific to God's promise.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So when a male Jewish boy was born, after the seven days of uncleanness,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   on the eighth day, he would immediately get circumcised as a covenant sign.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   But this circumcision symbolized more than just physical.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   It was a spiritual surgery that God wanted to perform on their human heart.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So God uses this concept of circumcision repeatedly in the Old Testament and the New Testament
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   to talk about circumcision of what?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Circumcision of heart, right?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   So in Deuteronomy 10.16 it says, "Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and be no longer stubborn."
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   So in other words, the covenant symbol, again, that every Jewish child had,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   that it should ultimately, what God is looking for is a circumcision of the heart.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And then in Jeremiah 4.4, "Circumcise yourself to the Lord, remove the foreskin of your heart,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my wrath go forth like fire,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and burn with none to quench it because of the evil of your deeds."
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So when it says to circumcise the foreskin of your heart, it's talking about the excess
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   that is not needed in your heart.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Give the Lord the covenant symbol.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So again, we see that in the New Testament where over and over again,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   the idea of circumcision is used to refer to a covenant symbol,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   not just external, but internal.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And what is the covenant symbol in the New Testament for a believer?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   The Holy Spirit.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   So the Holy Spirit is the symbol of the new covenant for the new covenant people
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   in the New Testament.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   So the law says that for 40 days, which is 7 days plus 33 for boys,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   after the birth of the son, or 80 days, so it's 14, 2 weeks for a girl, plus 66,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   which would come out to 80 days after the birth of a daughter,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   the mother and father were required to go to the sanctuary
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   and offer the sacrifices for the mother's cleansing.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So the distinction is when she has a boy child, for 7 days she's considered unclean.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And then after that, the boy is circumcised on the 8th day,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   but for the next 33 days she's considered unclean, but not like the first 7 days.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So the first 7 days she's unclean to the point where if somebody touches her
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   or she touches somebody else, you would become unclean.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So you weren't allowed to be around people, you weren't allowed to sit where she sits,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   you were not allowed to eat at the table.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   But the second part of it, the 33 days, it was ceremonial,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   meaning that you weren't allowed to come to the temple and give sacrifice.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   You could make contact, you could have sexual relations with your husband,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   you could be at the home, you could do all these other things,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   but you weren't allowed to come to the temple to make sacrifices.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Do you understand the distinction? No?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Do you understand the distinction between the first 7 days and the next 33 days?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Okay, I got like 4 of you.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   So the first 7 days, you're unclean, like unclean where you can't touch anybody,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   you can't be around anybody.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   If you touch them or they touch you, they also became unclean.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   The next 33 days was specifically ceremonial,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   that you weren't allowed to come to the temple,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   and if you did, you would end up defiling whatever it is that you came into contact with.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   But you were allowed to do your normal daily chores in those 33 days.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Yes? Okay.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   So the whole period is 40 days, but 7 days specific and 33 days general.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   For the girl, it's 2 weeks.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   For 2 weeks, you're not allowed to touch, wherever you sat,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   somebody else can't sit there, and so typically,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   you would have to be in a separate room or go somewhere
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   where you wouldn't have that kind of contact for 2 weeks.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And then after that, the second period is 60-60s, which is 80, if you were a girl.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Now we're going to get to that, because I'm pretty sure,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   somebody already asked me last week about that, why is that?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And I'm going to tell you now that some part of it is going to satisfy you
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   and some part of it is not.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   So I'm going to give you a heads up on that already.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   So after that period, the law says that a year old lamb was to be offered
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   as burnt offering and dove or pigeon as a sin offering on the mother's behalf.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   So as soon as it was over, the very first act that they did
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   when they went to the temple for a child, whether it was male or female,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   they would have to give a burnt offering.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   What was the burnt offering for?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   General atonement, right?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Basically acknowledging needing God's forgiveness and to blood to cover that person.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And that was the most frequent sacrifice that was given all throughout the sacrifices.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   In fact, sometimes they would give peace offering,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   they would give the burnt offering first.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   So you had to be forgiven of general covering in order to even enter into his presence,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   and then you would give a specific offering of sin offering or peace offering or other offerings.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   So burnt offering was oftentimes given first and then you give the specific offering.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   So in this case, they are to give the burnt offering to cover her generally
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   and then to give what? Sin offering on her behalf.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   So let's think about that for a second.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   She delivers a baby, which is considered in almost every culture that you and I know
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   to be one of the most sacred time for her and for the child.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   In fact, we would probably go so far as to say,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   if there's any time where she is considered more holy in her life than any other time,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   it's probably at the end of nine months giving birth.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Because she just went through purgatory, right?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And pushed this baby out and she did something that almost every human being on earth would acknowledge, right?
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   That it's something sacred.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   But for the Jewish community, the very first thing that she does is she gets isolated.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Then after the period of cleansing, she comes to the temple and has to give a sin offering,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   recognizing her sin after she gives birth.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   We'll get to that in a minute.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   The reasoning behind that period that we are given the first,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   whether it's 60 days or 40 days or 80 days, it says that lokiah is a discharge from a mother.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   So those of you guys who had no idea what that was,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   which I didn't know either until last night, okay?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Because I had to do some research.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   So I guess, I'm going to gross you out and not gross you out.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Okay, after you give birth, and so some of you ladies have given birth,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   so you know what happens.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Basically, there's a flow that happens, and that flow is called lokiah.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Look it up yourself. I'm just going to read it, okay?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Lokiah is a discharge from a mother who just delivered that continues for several weeks,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   sometimes from two to up to six weeks.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   And the second period of uncleanness, during that period,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   the second period of uncleanness had dual purpose.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   The first one, it allowed the new mother to regain her health and strength.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Now the scripture doesn't spell that out, but it's pretty clear that if she has to rest
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and she can't go out anywhere, she can't touch anything, she can't cook,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   it automatically gives her a period to be restored.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   That happens today anyway, right?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Whether you do it because the law told you to do it or not,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   as soon as a mother gives birth, she's isolated because you don't want her to get sick.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   She's breastfeeding, and so automatically we practice this anyway.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   But this is written into the law in Israel, for cleanness,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   and so she's completely isolated from other people for, again.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   So if you think of it that way, so if you have a male child, you're isolated for 40 days.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And if you have a female child, you get isolated for 80 days.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   So if you see it from that perspective, why only 40 days?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Alright, that's just my point of view, okay?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   I'm just trying to prepare you for what's coming, okay?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Just to get perspective, okay?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   So one of the reasons is she's probably able to get restored
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   and to recuperate from what just happened.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And again, obviously the second part of it is to restore her to ritual purity,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   to get her back and running like she was before.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   So the two main questions that we should be asking,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   if you studied it or if you read it, you probably came up with,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   why would a woman bearing children make her unclean?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   In every other circumstance, we would think that that period,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   she was probably more sacred and more honored and more special than any other time.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   But why in the Israel law is she considered unclean at that time?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Now, this command should not be regarded as something negative.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It's not something that, well God says she needs to be unclean,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   so bearing children from God's point of view is unclean.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   We shouldn't view it that way.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Remember we talked about the distinction between unholy and unclean?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Unholy is specific willful sin against God that needs to be repented of.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Unclean is where God looks at it and it's just not pure in his eyes, right?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   So this is obviously not unholy but unclean.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   In fact, the scripture where God's the one who commanded Adam and Eve
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   to be fruitful and multiply, to have multiple children, Genesis 128.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   In Psalm 127 verse 3, children are to be regarded as gifts from God.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And then in Psalm 123, a woman with many kids is considered to be blessed.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   So all throughout scripture, having children, having many children,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   at least in the Old Testament, was considered a blessing.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   So don't take from this law that God had a very negative view of having children.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Now having said that, what does this point to?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Remember everything that God does in the book of Leviticus,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   it has a larger purpose.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And what does it ultimately point to?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Every part of the book of Leviticus that we've been studying points to something.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   What does it point to?
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   It points to the gospel, right?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   It points to--instead of generally pointing and saying,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   "You know, God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and he's going to die for your sin, he's going to come."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   All of that is true, but Leviticus goes into the detailed matters of what sin, right?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   What kind of sin? How is the sin going to be atoned for?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Like what requires punishment?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   How do you approach God in worship?
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   What was lost?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So the book of Leviticus is the gospel message in detail.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So that when we look to the cross,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   the cross isn't just a generic or general sense of God's goodness and kindness towards sinners.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   He specifies how he saved us,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   what he saved us from,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   what the wrath looks like,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   what does God's anger look like, what does God's goodness look like.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   He goes into detailed description of every part of the gospel message.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So chapter 12 is no different.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   So when he is talking about this particular thing,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   obviously he gave these laws, but there was a reason.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And in this, it points to something very specific in the gospel message.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   So what do you think that this would point to?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   You don't have to answer, but just think about it.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   If every sacrifice, if every law points to something specific.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Remember last week we talked about the different dietary laws that God gave?
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And one of the things that we found out is anything that was not natural or normal,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   or something kind of went wrong, God created his order,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   and something in his order that went kind of astray was considered unclean.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And so all the animals that didn't fit the normal pattern of that category was considered unclean.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But the other part of it was that giving of the sacrifices caused the nation of Israel to clamp down
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and gather together, and the outsiders couldn't break in,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   because you couldn't eat with them.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   You couldn't eat with them, you couldn't go to their houses, and so he kept them separate.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   But then we come to the new covenant, and the new covenant God says to what?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   To go.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   So you look at redemptive history, mankind falls from God,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   God makes promise and he begins to draw near to him,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   he gives the law, tells him how this is going to be restored,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Leviticus actually gives him an avenue for them to come to him,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   and then after he delivers he begins to call people to the sanctuary.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And so that's Old Testament history.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And then when Christ comes, he comes and he basically cuts the curtain in half,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   saying that these sacrifices are no longer necessary,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   and he's no longer calling them just to himself.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   What is he doing? He's telling them to go.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And then in order for them to go, what happens?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   The dietary laws no longer apply.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And that was, remember, in the book of Acts,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   that was the primary thing that they were wrestling with.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Do the Gentiles have to keep this law?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Do the Jews have to continue to eat these things?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And one of the first visions that Peter gets is,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   what I declare to be clean, don't declare it unclean.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   So all of that pointed to the gospel, right?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   So what aspect of the gospel does this point to?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   This command points to the idea of original sin.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   With the birth of every precious child,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   it's a reminder that another sinner is entering into the world.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I don't think I have the verse.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Psalm 51, verse 5, what does David say?
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Turn your Bibles to Psalm 51, verse 5.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Can somebody who gets there first,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   if you have an electronic Bible, just type it in
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   and then just read it out loud for us?
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Psalm 51, verse 5.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Okay, so David in his repentance describes how his sin was,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   goes how deep?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   To his mother's womb.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   As soon as he was conceived, he recognizes that there was a sinful nature in him.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And so this particular law is a reminder to the nation of Israel
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   that even though a sacred child is coming into the world,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   he's coming in as a sinner.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Physically, socially, in every way, it was considered a blessing from God.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   From God's perspective, another sinner is coming into the world.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And that's why she became unclean.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   The sin offering for sins that were coming, if you remember,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   the sin offering points to the fact that there was some sin
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   that needed to be atoned for that was related to the childbirth.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   So again, she had to give the whole offering, the burnt offering,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   as a general atonement to be able to enter into his presence,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   but the specific offering that was to be given was the sin offering.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And what was the sin offering for?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Remember, they made a distinction between a willful rebellion against God
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   versus unintentional, right, or ignorant.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   So the sin offering that the woman is to give is not because
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   she willfully rebelled against God, right,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   but it was to recognize that there was sin, that this child, the sinner,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   she's just given birth to a sinner, right,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   and it is to cleanse her from that particular act, right,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   for unintentional sin that made her unclean and defiled before God.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   That's what the sin offering specifically was for,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and that's what is commanded for her to do.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   So this whole process is reminding the nation of Israel of the original sin.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   The child doesn't come into the world precious and clean until you defile it.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   The child comes into the world from day one, and as David says,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   in his mother's womb he was defiled.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And this was embedded into Israel's culture, right,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   where today, you know, a child comes into the world,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and the first thing we think of is all the hopes and dreams we have for this kid, right?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And even when we raise our kids, what do we do?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   We try to keep them protected from the filth of the world,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   make sure he doesn't associate with friends who are going to defile him.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Every parent goes through the same thing, but in the nation of Israel,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   from day one they are taught that a sinner is coming into the world, right,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   who needs to be atoned for, that only hope for the sinner is ultimately the blood of Christ.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Two different situations cause uncleanness, the moral transgression and ceremonial defilement.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Right, moral transgression caused spiritual defilement.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   However, the ceremonial defilement did not necessarily mean that the defiled person had sinned.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   We talked about that already.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   [silence]
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Later on, this is not today, but in chapter 15, it also talks about the reproduction is essential to survival of the human race,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   yet intercourse makes man and woman unclean, in chapter 15, verse 18.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   So this is kind of related to this, right?
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Remember we talked about the chiastic form?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   It begins with the uncleanness that comes with the birth, but it also, in chapter 15,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   says uncleanness comes with the very inception, right?
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And all of this to remind the nation of Israel, as the human beings multiply, what also multiplies?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Sinners are multiplying.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   You know, in the book of Genesis, where it says that the mankind, as it was multiplying,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and the more they multiplied, the more what happened?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Sin multiplied.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And then when they got gathered and they got organized, what did they do?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   They started challenging God, right?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And so this particular law embedded into Israel's history, a constant reminder that they are in the need of atonement, even from birth.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   [silence]
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   The second question, which is, I'm sure you guys were thinking,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   why does bearing a child, girl child, require twice as long a period of uncleanness as a boy?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Now, let me tell you right off the bat, okay, that there is no clear consensus on this.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   So, some of it is going to be satisfying, some of it may not be satisfying.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   But, let me begin with the challenge of this, okay, with this challenge,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   which is one of the questions that I ask for our discussion questions.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Where does your sense of fairness come from?
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Do you have a sense of fairness that you project onto God?
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Or do you understand a sense of fairness because God told you?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I want you to think about that for a minute, right?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Do we bring our understanding of fairness and then we look to see if God is fair,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   or do we come to the Word of God and let the Word of God dictate what I should be considering to be fair or unfair?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   So, having said that, even before we go through the discussion,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   if God says men have more value, how would you respond?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Don't stone me yet.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I just want you to challenge your paradigm, I just want to challenge your thinking.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   If God said that females require the double number of cleansing because God sees greater value in men,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   how does that affect you?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Not good, huh?
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I mean, like you want to throw something at me.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Okay, I just want to throw that out there because as we are studying this section,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   I already told you that there is no clear consensus on this,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   but if we come before God to understand a difficult text with a preconceived notion of what I believe to be good,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   and if God doesn't answer my question to my satisfaction, then I question God.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Then you have to take a step back and ask yourself, where do you stand before God?
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Are you standing before God, or is God standing before you?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Now, I'm putting that out there as a foundation before we even get into this.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I'm not going to answer these questions just to satisfy you.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I'm going to tell you what it says, and then you wrestle with what it says.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Why does bearing a girl child require twice as long a period of uncleanness as a boy?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   There are many different thoughts behind this, but the first,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   "The longer period of ceremonial uncleanness to the birth of a daughter may point to the fact that Eve was the one who was initially tempted and introduced sin to mankind."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   1 Timothy 2, chapter 13 and 14.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Let me just start reading from verse 12.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   "I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over man. Rather, she is to remain quiet.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Yet she will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control."
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   So, the first thing that we know, again, this is not just 1 Timothy, but the scripture talks about how Eve brought temptation into the creation,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   and she said it was you who submitted, and as a result of that, Adam fell.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   So that's the reasoning behind it that's given to us in this text.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   2 Corinthians 11, verse 3.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   "But I am afraid that as a serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from the sincere and pure devotion to Christ."
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   So again, repeated to emphasize that Eve was the one who was first tempted.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And I'm going to go even further than that. If you could turn to the second passage in Leviticus chapter 27, 2-7.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Go to Leviticus chapter 27, 2-7. We're going to get to that when we study it later, but I want to read that section to you.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I'm going to already tell you, you're not going to like it. Leviticus chapter 27, 2-7.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   It says, "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, 'If anyone makes a special vow to the Lord involving a valuation of a person,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   then let the valuation of a male from 20 years old up to 60 years old shall be 50 shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   If the person is a female, the valuation shall be 30 shekels."
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   So if it was a male, between the age of 20 and 60 is 50 shekels. If it is a female, it is 30 shekels.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Now, the vow that he's talking about is a dedication. If someone is dedicated for the service of the Lord,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and you're offering that, the value of a male servant who is being dedicated is 50 shekels.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   The value of the woman is 30 shekels.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   How does that sit well with you?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Don't say anything. I just want you to digest it.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Does God seem unfair?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Don't lie to me.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Because He does.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Because everything in our culture has been working toward equality between men and women
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   to the point where any mention of any inequality of any kind, it seems unrighteous.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   And we're not talking about a hint of this. We're talking about outright, women are worth this much and men are worth this much.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Now, just to explain this particular law.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Now, again, taking our concept of what we think is right and wrong, no matter what the circumstance,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   everybody should be equal, just think emotions taken out of it.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   If you are purchasing a horse,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   I'm going to get in trouble, but I'm going to say it anyway.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   If you're purchasing a horse, and one horse is stronger than the other horse,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   and that first horse can pull twice the weight as the second horse,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   and so I ask, when I'm selling this horse, this horse is worth $100, the second horse is going to worth $50,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   because he can only do half the work.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Is that unjust?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   You don't want to see it.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   If you take emotions out of it, and you're just, "Oh, they're human beings, they're not the same thing."
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   But we're talking about work, dedication, a vow to serve the Lord,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   and it says the male servant is going to be able to do more work because physically strong.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Now, maybe if they're going to be nurturing the baby, or something that requires a female touch,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   they can do a better job, but specifically for the purpose of farming,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   and that requires physical strength, and I know you feminists,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   if you have some feminism in you, and maybe you're angry, don't be angry with me.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Get on your knees and ask God, "Why is this in here?"
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   How much of your understanding and my understanding of fairness is implanted in you from the world?
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And how much of it ultimately comes from God?
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   I'm not making any statement, I'm just asking you.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   How much of your understanding of fairness is really dictated from the world that you grew up in,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   what you have embraced, and how much of it is directly coming from God?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Let's say you had no influence from the world,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   and your idea of right and wrong was strictly coming from scripture, and you read that.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   You wouldn't have this knee-jerk reaction, right?
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Because this is what's being taught in the scripture,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   your right and wrong is being dictated by what you see in scripture.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   But the reason why there's a reaction is because certain things that I'm reading in the scripture
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   is just not meshing well with things that I was taught, that I've embraced.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Now, I'm going to wrap this up, but before I wrap this up, I want to challenge our thinking.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   We've all fallen, men and women.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   So our idea of power is tainted with our idea of sinful nature.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   So automatically, when a man is given authority, he's thinking authority in a very sinful way.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   When you give somebody power who has sin in his heart, automatically he thinks in a sinful way,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   and he applies it in a sinful way.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   So part of sanctification is that whatever we had before we met Christ,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   he says to do what? To renew of your mind, to not be conformed to this world, but be transformed.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   So our idea of where do we get morality of right and wrong?
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   From God. God is the ultimate lawgiver. He's the only one who is just.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   He's the only one who's ultimately fair, because he's the only one who sees all things.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   So if I'm truly submitted and he's my Lord, my Lord dictates to me what is right and what is wrong.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   The Lord dictates to me what is fair and what is unfair,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   because he sees beyond just a superficial service.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   So much of what we bring in is because this is what we've been taught.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   This is our sense of fairness.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Now, I'm going to wrap this up.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   There is a theory out there, and again, whether you believe this or not, that's up to you,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   but another theory, J.P. Magnet has a theory that since some vaginal bleeding can occur
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   on the part of the newborn girl, the double time of the mother's purification
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   could be based on the actual and potential genital discharge of both females.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   I didn't know this either.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It is something that people in your medical profession,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   they said there are cases when a young girl is born that she has potential of discharging,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   and so the reason why it's double the time is because it's two females instead of one.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Now, true or not, I don't know.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   This is one of the theories. I just thought it was interesting.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Let me wrap this up.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   The point of all of these laws, ultimately, is to point to something very specific
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   that God was going to fulfill and restore.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   If we apply the concept of value and good and bad based upon our fallen idea of what's bad and good,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   then Jesus is a subordinate of God the Father, and he has lesser value than God,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   which you and I would admit is heresy.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   That would be absolute heresy.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Then the Holy Spirit, out of the three, he's the third younger brother,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   and so God the Father is worth $100 and the Son $50 and the Holy Spirit maybe a few dollars.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   If we apply our sinful understanding of value, Jesus said the complete opposite.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   He said the reason why he said he who serves is the greatest in the kingdom of God,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   he's basically challenging the worldly idea of what is great.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   He's flipping it completely upside down.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Your concept of great and good is tainted by sin.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   In the kingdom of God, that thing is completely flipped.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   If we were to flip this around and apply a perspective that Jesus gave in the New Testament
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   of what is and is not, then it begins to look a little bit different.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   I'm not saying that's the answer, but if we apply how Jesus taught us how to value things
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   in the New Testament and you begin to apply and begin to see that in the Old Testament,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   first of all, we wouldn't naturally have that knee-jerk reaction because Jesus himself,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   who was of the greatest value, became nothing.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Then he told his followers to do the same.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Having said that, that's all just philosophical things to help us to understand what's going on
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   because we look at all of these things and we're applying the worldly principles of right and wrong,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   just and unjust, into the Old Testament where we ought to be applying a new paradigm
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   into how we look at the kingdom, which was the paradigm that Jesus taught us.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Now, what does all of this point to?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Ultimately, all of this points to original sin.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Ultimately, it points to how we got here in the first place because of what Eve did.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Was Eve the only one that sinned? No, but it initiated with her because she brought it in.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   So, if the point of all of this is for the purpose of reversing the curse,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   the thing that gets the most attention is what brought the curse in, which was Eve.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Correct?
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   So, if you go to the New Testament and God places the order and tells the men to submit to Christ
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   and the women to submit to the church, and all of this is a reversal of what happened at the fall
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   where the woman takes charge, or Eve takes charge, and then causes Adam,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   not causes, but initiates and brings it in, and Adam basically listens to her
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   and then brings the curse upon mankind, when you come to the New Testament,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   the order that God establishes is the order to reverse that curse.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   So, even in this, when a male comes in, it's 40 days.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   When you have a girl, it's not because, again, you can talk about all the physiological,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   medical reasons behind that, but ultimately, those are all just guesses.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   It may or may not.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   But the spiritual meaning behind it, I think, is pretty clear.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   It's pointing to original sin, it's pointing to how original sin first came in.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   And all of this is to highlight the reversal, the redemption that Christ was going to bring.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   But the...oh, I had this first.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   But when we come to the New Covenant, Jesus himself says in Galatians 3.28,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ."
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   You know how incredible that would have sounded to anybody at that particular time?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   How can there be no slave, right, or free?
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Clearly, if you're a slave, you have lesser value, because the slave owners own you.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   But Jesus says, in the kingdom of God, there is no slave, there is no free.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   There is no male, there is no female.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Female at that time couldn't own property.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Men could pretty much treat his wife and his children like his own property.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   But Jesus, in the New Covenant, right, when the curse is reversed,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   and we're back into what God intended in the Garden of Eden,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   he says there is no hierarchy.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   There is no value between a slave and a slave owner, male or female.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   All of these things are things that point to a specific thing that went wrong
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   because of the curse, because of the sin.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   What God intends is this.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   What God is trying to bring us to is this.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   And then the other part that I want to finish with is Jesus' parents.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   We see in Luke 2, 21-24.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   When he is born, he is circumcised, and then on the eighth day,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   they take him to the temple, and they go through the purification process also for Jesus.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   In other words, Jesus came through this system that God has established,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   ultimately to fulfill the law.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   He said, "I didn't come to abolish the law, but fulfill it."
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Because everything that is taught in the Scripture ultimately points to the fulfillment in Christ.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   And when it is fulfilled, and it is restored the way God originally intended,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   we get Galatians 3.28.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   So let's not get caught up in the details, and because of the paradigm that we have,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   but ultimately recognize that all of these things ultimately is because Christ is coming to redeem us.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   I hope that makes sense.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Like I told you, some of it will be satisfying, some of it you still may have an answer,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   but ultimately I want to challenge even the way that we ask questions.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   So three discussion questions today.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Does the Word of God have final authority on how you determine if something is right or wrong,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   or do you think you put more weight on your sense of justice?
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   How do you determine if you lean more toward one or the other?
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Number two, the doctrine of original sin means that there is no human being who is born innocent,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   but with a sinful nature.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   How do you think this inclination toward sin affected how we determine what is right and wrong,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   our sense of justice and injustice?
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Give specific examples.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   So that second question is similar to the first one, but how do you determine that?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   What specific examples can you give in how you came to a conclusion,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   or maybe an observation of something else?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Number three, does salvation do away with the original sin nature completely?
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   If we are a new creation according to 2 Corinthians 5.17 and are born again according to John 4,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   why do we still have desires to sin?
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   How has the way you deal with sin changed after you became a Christian?
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   So take some time to discuss that in your group.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   Let me pray for us and then we'll release you to your small group.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   And we know that there's a lot of things that we read, especially even today,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   that may disturb us and may be difficult to understand.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   But we pray, Lord, that you would sanctify our thoughts,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   that even our ability to understand who you are,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   we're completely dependent upon your Holy Spirit to teach and to open our eyes.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Help us, Lord God, to submit to you,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   and not to try to put you in a box that we understand,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   but to recognize, Lord God, that you are sovereign
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   and that your weakness is infinitely greater than our ability to even understand.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Help us to understand who you are. Help us understand your economy.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   Help us understand your heart and your plan of salvation, Father,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   that all of these things would only add to understanding your kingdom
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   that will eventually come, that as he is glorified, we will be glorified with him.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   We thank you, Father in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
