[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [silence]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We're looking at Leviticus chapter 10 today.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   [silence]
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   If you guys remember, chapter 8 and 9 was the inauguration of the sacrifices.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And the priests were cleansed, they were ordained,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and then the first sacrifice was given in chapter 9, the burden sacrifice.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And then in chapter 10, the sons. Aaron gives his sacrifice.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And so now we're in chapter 10 where his two sons, they begin to serve the temple,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   or the tabernacle. And as you guys know, Adab and Nebihu,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   because they offered up strange fire, they end up dying.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And so this is a very significant chapter because,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I mean, obviously every part of it is important, but the meaning behind it
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and what God was teaching the nation of Israel through this
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   is not just to the nation of Israel. And I personally believe
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   that it's because we don't know this aspect of God, or very superficially.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And part of the reason why we have a superficial understanding of the gospel
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and sanctification and worship and all of that is because
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   this aspect of his nature is so downplayed,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   where it's almost strange to think that God would ever put anybody to death
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   for something like this. So again, we want to dive into chapter 10,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   look at the details, and again, every part of this, it not only reveals
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   what God thinks about the tabernacle, it reveals something about his nature
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and his nature in relation to sinful men.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And so that's the point of all of this. So let me pray first,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   and then we'll jump into chapter 10 today.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Heavenly Father, we come before you with heaviness of heart,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   knowing, Father God, that just how weighty and important
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   these matters are, Lord God, in Leviticus.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Though we are no longer under the law because of Christ
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   and what he suffered on our behalf, help us to glean and understand
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   who you are and what it means to have a relationship
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   with the holy, holy, holy God. I pray, Father God,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   that the revelation through chapter 10 would not just inform us
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   about the history of what has happened, but help us to know
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   where we are, where we stand, and how we got here.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   That there would be a sense of weightiness to be in your presence,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   to worship you, ultimately, Lord, to be in your presence for eternity.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   So give us deeper understanding. Help us to have a fuller understanding
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   of who you are. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So remember we talked about, just as a quick review, Exodus.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   What was the theme of the book of Exodus? Remember how it ended?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   God told them not to come because he's given the law.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   If they come up to the mountain, they shall surely die.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   He sets up the tabernacle, and then we get to chapter,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   or in the book of Leviticus, and the theme of the book of Leviticus
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   is this holy God being in the presence of sinful man.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And he couldn't just do that. If he just came without going through
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   all of this, what would have happened to mankind?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   They would have died, right? He says no man can see God and live.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And so the whole drama that we see in the book of Leviticus
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   is to create a way to cover for mankind's sin.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Because in the presence of God as they are, without the covering of blood,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   they shall surely die. That's what the scripture says.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And then after he establishes the book of Leviticus,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   in how this holy God can be in the presence of the nation of Israel,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   we get to the book of Numbers where he invites people to the tabernacle,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   and now they're able to interact with him.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So that's the kind of theme of these three books.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And so where we are in the book of Leviticus is God has been teaching
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   every single part of this is the nature of his holiness
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   and man's sinfulness and how that can be reconciled.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So Leviticus basically is the gospel message, every part of it.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   But it's not just a simplistic gospel message where God is holy, man is sinful,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   somebody died, and then so therefore we're good.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So that in and of itself obviously is the gospel.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   But there's detailed aspects where God wanted Israel to know
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   what does it mean for God to be holy?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   What does it mean for man to be sinful?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So he describes sin in detail.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Inadvertent sin, a rebellious sin.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   There's sin where you touch something and you defile something.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   There's burnt offering, there's peace offering.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So all of these things are descriptions of various kinds of sins
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and how that needs to be dealt with to be in the presence of a holy God.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So in the context of that, chapter 10 basically is a warning
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   that if you do not follow what I tell you,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   that this is what's going to happen.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So can you imagine what happens to the nation of Israel after this?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I can imagine maybe some level of excitement before.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   They were setting this whole up, it's like our God who delivered us
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   from the nation of Israel, a powerful God,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   who caused us to cross the Red Sea, and he's going to be in our midst.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   We're going to be able to make sacrifices, and he's allowing us to come to him.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   So you can kind of imagine the excitement that may have been in the nation of Israel
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   as they were going through the setup of this tabernacle.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   But can you imagine what happened after this?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I mean, who would dare come to the tabernacle?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   They weren't worshipping idols.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It wasn't a rebellion against God, at least not on the surface.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   But simply because they offered something that was not authorized.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   They die.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So you can imagine what this did, and I think it was very deliberate.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   God deliberately brings fear upon the nation of Israel
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   to give them an understanding of the seriousness of what it means to approach God.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And you can imagine after what happens in chapter 10
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   that every part of what God's been telling them up to this point,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   they probably went back and combed through every part of it
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   to make sure they got nothing wrong.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I'm sure they've been paying attention, but imagine if they just kind of skimmed through
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and they were kind of like, "Well, you know, we kind of got it."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'll bet you after chapter 10, that was not the case.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Every single worshipper, every single priest probably combed through
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   everything that was taught to make sure that it was done properly,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   which is exactly what God wanted them to do.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   The death of Nadab and Abihu.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Nadab and Abihu were the two eldest sons of Aaron.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   He had four of them. They're mentioned in Leviticus 8.30.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And they were already ordained and ready to serve.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So chapter 10 was the beginning of the serving of Aaron's children.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   So Nadab and Abihu are the two oldest sons.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   We're not sure exactly what it is that they did.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   All it says is that they gave up unauthorized fire.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It was not commanded by God.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   So we don't know the details of what happened. He doesn't even explain.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   He doesn't say, "I told them not to do this and they broke it."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   All it says was they did something that they weren't supposed to do.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   On the surface, they burned incense and looked like they were doing
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   what they were supposed to do, but it doesn't explain.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   All it says is they did something that was not commanded,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   which was a serious enough offense that it would bring fire and consume them.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So if the whole point of this tabernacle was to get people to come to him,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   what happens in chapter 10 is going to throw a wrench in all of that.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Who would dare approach God after this?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   God was very precise. He's been precise, but all the laws that we've seen up to this point,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   it is not comprehensive. In fact, if you study the other parts of the Bible,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   in Exodus and Chronicles, and you see various parts where they're actually practicing the sacrifices,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   the laws were actually a lot more detailed than what's written in the book of Leviticus.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Leviticus is not comprehensive. So a lot of the stuff that we know about the sacrifices
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   are things that we learn from studying all of Scripture.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   From the Chronicles, from the Kings, from Exodus, from Numbers.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And so we know that this particular thing about the incense,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   he was so precise that he actually even tells them what material to use,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   where they're supposed to get the coal, and even the time of day.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Like every morning that they're supposed to do this.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   So I just put that up there just to inform just how precise God was with his law.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It was not like, "Okay, I want you to come and just bring this animal."
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   But even the way you handled it, where you laid your hand, where you ate, all of that.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   How you dressed when you ate, when you were inside and outside, when you were to do it,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   what coal, which hand, all of that was all prescribed in Scripture.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   We don't know exactly what they violated, but we know that in Leviticus 9.24,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   the first time the fire comes down from heaven, where God sends his angel,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   it was to consume the burnt offering that Aaron gave in chapter 9.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So chapter 9 ends with Aaron giving the burnt offering,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and then God comes with this fire, consumes it.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Do you remember what happens as a result of that?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Chapter 9.24, "And fire came out from before the Lord,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So there was a sense of awe.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   People fell down, and it just kind of spontaneous worship happened
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   when the presence of God appears because of the fire.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   But obviously, the second instance of the sacrifice does not lead to worship, but terror.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   God speaks to Aaron through Moses to declare why his sons were killed in verse 3.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   So we don't know exactly what it is, other than that it was unauthorized fire,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   but the explanation given in verse 3 is that this is what the Lord has said,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   "Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified."
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Somebody here has an NASB version?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Whoever has an NASB, can you just read it out loud for us?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Really?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   None of you guys have an NASB version?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Yeah, I know Dr. Peng does.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Verse 3.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Okay.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   So if you look at verse 3, the meaning is the same, but I think it's a bit more clear in the NASB,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   because the NASB says, "I will be treated as holy."
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   In other words, whatever it was that they did, they didn't consider his holiness,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   the weightiness of who he is.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   So they ignored some of the rules when they came to God.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So it was an act of irreverence toward him, this unauthorized fire.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It wasn't simply a mistake, it was irreverence toward God.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And this irreverence toward God was what led to this capital punishment.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   In fact, we see the same thing in Numbers chapter 20, verse 12.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Can somebody turn to Numbers chapter 20, verse 12?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I don't think I have the verses.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Again, really, nobody else has NASB?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I think ESV translation is okay in this one.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Numbers chapter 20, verse 12.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Okay, can you read it out loud?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Okay, right there.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   So in Numbers chapter 20, verse 12, the context of that is,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   remember where they're about to enter the Promised Land,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and Israelites are complaining again, and Moses is just fed up with these people.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And they come before God, and God says, "Give them what they want.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Give them the water."
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And then Moses strikes the rock.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   We don't know exactly what it is that he did,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   but what he did was not what God wanted him to do.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And so the water comes, and as a result of that,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   he is banned from entering to the Promised Land.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   So think about it.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   For 40 years, he didn't even want to lead these people.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   God basically commanded him to do so.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   He persevered for 40 years with the whining and complaining,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   and then right as he is entering the Promised Land,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   that this offense was serious enough that he was banned from entering into the Promised Land.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And what was that offense?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   He didn't present God as holy.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   He didn't present God as holy.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   In other words, there was irreverence.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   So we're not exactly what it was that he did that showed irreverence,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   but the same thing is said about Moses.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And it was serious enough that this man who represented Israel,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   the greatest leader in Israel,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   was prevented from entering into the very thing that he probably was daydreaming about for 40 years.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And he said he couldn't enter.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So this sin of irreverence toward God is very, very, very serious.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   That's the point that he's trying to make to the nation of Israel.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And he is consistent all throughout scripture, irreverence toward God.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Now, let me just pull back a little bit.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Because if we don't understand the nature of who God is,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   you can even as a Christian live the rest of your life centered around yourself.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   You love God, don't love God based upon what he does or doesn't do for you.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   We talk about lordship, but the lordship is just a word.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And so our affection for God, worship to God, and obedience to God
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   is all contingent upon what he is doing in my life, how he is answering my prayers.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   But if you understand the nature of God and who it is that we worship,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   and who it is that we've been reconciled to,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   it reorients our understanding of our own salvation.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And the whole point of all of this, it wasn't simply about a wrong attitude.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   It's a complete wrong understanding of judgment,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   complete wrong understanding of salvation,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   complete wrong understanding of life.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   So, again, let me just kind of go off tangent for just a minute.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   If rebellion against God is self-centeredness,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   God gave him the command and instead of obeying this,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   "Do not eat of this tree," and he basically ignores it,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   mankind ignores it and they just do it.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And it seems like a trivial thing that they did,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   but at the core of it is their fighting against God for who's going to be central.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Is God going to be Lord or are you going to be Lord?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   So even in our salvation, after we are saved,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   if our whole life is centered around yourself,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   how is that different than the rebellion at the Garden of Eden?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   It isn't.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Because the whole point of man's sin was to say, "I am at the center."
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   So if we live our Christian lives with my needs and my desire
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and God fulfilling my needs and my desire,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   how is that any different than the rebellion of Adam and Eve?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   There is no difference.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   So a man who has not given lordship to Christ
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   has not been reconciled in his relationship with God.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   A man who is living a self-centered life
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and is no different than the rebellion at the Garden of Eden
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   has not been reconciled with God.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Because you can't be reconciled to God on your terms.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Hopefully that's clear.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   You cannot be reconciled to God on your terms.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   So the whole point of the book of Leviticus is,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   if you are going to come to God, these are the things that God is allowing.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And the reason why the blood of Christ needed to be shed
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   was that all of these things were just a shadow.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   It's just to point to you that these are the things that are necessary for you to come.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And that's why Christ came and He fulfills it.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   But the point of the fulfillment is to be reconciled to God,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   to declare Him and His glory, to recognize Him and His glory.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   So again, John Calvin says of this,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   "If we reflect how holy a thing God's worship is,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   the enormity of the punishment will by no means offend us.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Besides, it was necessary that their religion should be sanctioned
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   as it is very commencement.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   For if God had suffered the sons of Aaron to transgress with impunity,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   they would have afterwards carelessly neglected the whole law.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   This, therefore, was the reason for such great severity
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   that priests should anxiously watch against all profanation."
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   So the whole point of all of this is to, from the very get-go,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   that the rules and regulations that God gave were not just suggestions.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   These were life and death.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   If you followed it, you lived.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   If you didn't follow it, you shall surely die.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Because you can't be in the presence of a holy God.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   You can't be reconciled to God on your terms.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   So all of these are given so that sinful man can be covered in his sin.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   So when we come to God with strange fire, meaning on our terms,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   natural things that's going to happen is you're going to die.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And that was the point that he was trying to make.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And as a result of that, it simply says Aaron held his tongue.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   These are his children, first and second child.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   They die right in front of him, and Aaron says nothing.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   He probably knew what they did was a violation of God's law.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And Aaron himself at one point was guilty.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   You remember the fact that Aaron is still alive
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   and is able to function as a high priest is a demonstration of his mercy
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   because you know what happened in the very beginning of Israel's history.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   He's the guy who was responsible for the golden calf,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and he presented it to Israel.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   The fact that he actually is living is because of God's mercy.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   So he was in no position to protest before God,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   even with the death of his two children.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   But we're going to see further just how serious this is.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Nadab and Abihu are buried in verse 4-7,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   but instead of Eleazar and Nethemar,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   which are the other two children of Israel,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   the third and fourth child of Aaron,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   instead of them burying their older brother,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   their cousins, Mishael and Elzaphan,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   are commanded to carry out Nadab and Abihu's bodies outside the camp.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   So typically, family members were allowed to bury them, obviously,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   but God wouldn't allow Aaron or his children to touch their bodies.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   The reason behind that was that Aaron and his sons
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   are not permitted to mourn for their sons' brothers lest they die,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   and the wrath of God be on the whole congregation, in verse 6.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   "So Moses said to Aaron and Nethemar, his sons,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   'Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and do not tear your clothes, lest you die,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   and the wrath come upon all the congregation.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   But lest your brothers and the whole house of Israel
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   be well the burning that the Lord has kindled.'"
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   So if you look at verse 6, it says,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   "Do not let your hair on your heads hang loose,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   and do not tear your clothes."
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   What was that act of? Anybody?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   It was a sign of mourning, right?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So when God says, "Do not untie your hair,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and do not rip your clothes,"
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   in other words, God is basically preventing and saying,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   "You are not allowed to mourn for this."
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   You're going to go about your business.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   It seems cold and harsh,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   but He won't allow them to bury His own children.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   So cousins come, and then He says,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   "You're not allowed to tear your clothes,"
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   like any parent or any brother would do.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   He said, "You're not allowed to do that."
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And He says three separate times, "Or you shall die."
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So He gives regulations in verse 6, 7, and 9.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   In other words, the seriousness of what you just saw,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   that if you do not follow what I tell you to do,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   you shall surely die.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And He repeats it three separate times
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   to make sure that they understood.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   That don't let what happened to them happen to you.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Follow my instructions.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   This was partly because they were the nearest
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   in relations to Nadab and Nebihu,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and there was some level of culpability of their sins
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   with Aaron and his sons.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   So if you can turn with me to Joshua 7.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Turn your Bible to Joshua 7.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Just to kind of give context and understanding.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   So turn your Bible to Joshua 7.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   [pages turning]
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And we'll look at...
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I'm not going to read the whole thing,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   but in verse 1,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   "But the people of Israel broke faith
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   in regard to the devoted things.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   For Achan, the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   son of Zerah in the tribe of Judah,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   took some of the devoted things,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and the anger of the Lord burned against the people of Israel."
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   So basically the context of this is,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   when they were going into Jericho,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   God told the nation of Israel,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   "Don't touch anything because everything is under a ban."
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Meaning God had determined that everything in there
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   was to be judged.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Achan decides that he's going to take some of the choice things
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   and ignore God.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   And as a result of that,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   they go and charge into the city of Ai,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   which was a much smaller city.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And they take over 3,000 men to go over there,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   and then they get defeated by them.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   When they come back, Joshua is confused.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   They were able to go into Jericho without any problem,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and then they go after this tiny city,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   and they get defeated.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   So they ask God, "What happened?"
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And God says, "This is exactly--this is what happened.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   I told you not to touch anything, but Achan sinned."
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   But the way he describes Achan's sin,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   look with me in verse 11.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   He says, "Israel has sinned.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   They have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   They have taken some of the devoted things.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   They have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings."
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   So let me start right there.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Achan's the only one who committed the sin, right?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So in other words, God's saying the reason why you weren't able to defeat Ai
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   was that the reason why you were able to defeat Jericho in the first place
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   was not because of you.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And that was the whole purpose of that drama of going around, right,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   with the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   is to demonstrate and to teach Israel
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   that your power is not within yourself.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   It's when you obey, the Lord will be with you.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   So when you disobey, even a small nation you can't conquer.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   But the way he described the sin, he doesn't simply say Achan sinned.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   He said Israel has sinned, right?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And as a result of Israel's sin, these things have happened.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   So if you look, go back down to verse 16.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   So Achan is going to be punished for this sin,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   but I want you to look at how he's punished.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   "So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and tribe of Judah was taken."
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   So the whole nation of Israel shows up,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   and then from--because Israel is guilty.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Remember he said, "Israel, you have sinned," right?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Even though it was just Achan.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   So among Israel, they take the tribe of Judah.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   "And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of Zerahites was taken."
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   So within Judah, the clan of Zerahites.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   "And then he brought near the clan of Zerahites man by man,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and Zebda was taken."
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   So from that group, he takes one by one from that family.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   "He brought near his household man by man,"
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   so he would bring his family from that group,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   "and then the Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   of the tribe of Judah was taken."
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   So what is this whole drama?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Why don't I just go into his house and get him and then punish him?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   God made them all stand together, the whole nation of Israel,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   and then goes into Judah, and then from Judah,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   he would take the clan, from the clan, he would take the group,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   and from that group, he would target the family,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and from that family, he would take Achan.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   What was the drama behind all of that?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   The culpability of the whole nation,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   and the nearer they were to the proximity of this man,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   they were accountable for his actions.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   So even though Achan committed the action,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   his family was guilty to a certain degree.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   His clan was guilty, the next group, and after that was his tribe,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and after that, the whole nation of Israel.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   God didn't just say, "You sinned, and only you."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So again, in an individualistic culture like you and I,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   where it's just me, I didn't commit it, it was them,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   it's very difficult for us to understand this,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   but in the biblical mindset, the way God sees it,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   he does see us in the context of the community that we belong to.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   We are culpable for one another.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   It's like my brother's kippah, and the answer is yes.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   That's what God says.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   In the community of the church, if there is sin in the church,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   and we do nothing about that sin,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   there is a level of culpability in us.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   The leaders are the first ones.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   If we see sin, and we just sweep it under the rug,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   and God judges, there's a stricter judgment upon the leadership,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   but it's not just the leaders.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   If we look at sin, and we ignore sin,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   there are different degrees of culpability,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   but there is culpability, depending on how near you are.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Again, all of this is so that we can get an understanding
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   of how God sees sin, and how God brings punishment.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   It is not just this individualistic thing that we see.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   There is a responsibility for what we see around us.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   He doesn't allow them to mourn.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   There is a certain degree of culpability
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   because those two were their family and brothers.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And because Nehemiah and Nebihu's death was a capital punishment,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   they were not even allowed to leave the tabernacle
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   to join the physical mourning of their brothers and sons.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   In other words, they were told to go about their business
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   and keep doing their work.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   It seems cold.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   But that's how weighty, that's how serious this was.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And if Aaron and his children were going to do this,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   they had to submit.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   And he said, "If you don't, you shall surely die."
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   In the next section, verse 8-11,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   the Lord speaks to Aaron directly.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Up to now, God only spoke to Aaron through Moses.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Moses was the mediator between Israel and God up to this point.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   But for the first time in verse 8, God speaks directly to Aaron.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   If you notice verse 7, it basically ends,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   after all the instructions are given,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   it basically ends by saying,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   "They did according to the word of Moses."
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   In other words, they took it very seriously, what God said.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   God said not to touch, not to mourn, not to leave,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   and they did exactly what God told them to do, and they obey.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And as a result of that, this points to the fact
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   that Aaron has been accepted as high priest
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   and now functions as God's mediator to the people.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   So this was a very, very serious lesson
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   that Aaron and his two children,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   at the very get-go of the service of the tabernacle.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Can you imagine going to work on the very first day?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   You get slapped with something this serious,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   and after that, how terrified you would be to come to work.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   That's basically what happened.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   This was not like a once-a-year occurrence,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   him coming to the tabernacle.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Aaron was in charge of all the sacrifices,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   all the incense, all of it.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So imagine what God was trying to teach Aaron
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   and the nation of Israel,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   to take the holiness of God seriously.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Don't let it just be a word.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Don't let it just be an idea.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   You're talking about a visual, emotional, physical, social
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   ramification of his holiness in the presence of sinful man.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   So when he says sinful people in the presence of God
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   will surely die, it wasn't just words.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   It wasn't a suggestion.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   It wasn't a possibility.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   It was a fact.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   You cannot be in the presence of God on your own terms, period.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   God forbids Aaron and his sons not to drink wine or strong drink.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Some speculated that possibly Nader and Nebihu may have been drunk.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Again, this is complete speculation.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   They think that maybe that's the reason,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   because drinking was not prohibited.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   In fact, you see it oftentimes with the prophets and various people.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   It was not prohibited.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   But probably a better understanding of that was,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   we see the Nazarite vow in the Old Testament,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   that when an individual was completely devoted to God for his service,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   that part of his vow was not to touch strong drink.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And again, to keep his mind and his body ready and alert in service at all times.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   So again, God says to come to serve at the tabernacle,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   God is demanding that they are kept completely pure.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   And to be completely dedicated.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   So in verse 12 to 20, we see three separate sacrifices.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   It doesn't say grain offering, peace offering, and sin offering,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   but if you look at the details, how it describes,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   it's a description of these three sacrifices.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   To eat the grain offering, basically he said go back to business,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   to offering sacrifices, and then he says go,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   in the grain offering, make sure that you eat this in the holy place.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   He says to go eat the peace offering,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   and make sure that you eat it in a clean place.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And then third, he talks about the purification offering,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and what to do with that. He was to eat that.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   That the priest eating this stuff, eating the sacrifices,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   it was not just a, oh, you get to eat,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and so we're just going to eat anywhere.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Remember we talked about how God prescribes specifically what they can and cannot eat,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and he even prescribed where to eat it.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Remember why that was necessary?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Because the eating was part of the sacrifice.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   It was something that God was teaching them,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   so it was part of the sacrament.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   It wasn't just, hey, we have food, now we get to eat,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and just kind of go, and like any other time we eat.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   It was part of the ritual sacrifice.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And so Moses gets angry because they do the first and second,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   but when it comes to the purification offering,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   for whatever the reason, they did not eat.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   They don't obey.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   So Moses gets angry because he just told them,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   if you don't know exactly what I tell you to do,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   you shall surely die, you shall surely die, you shall surely die.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   They just saw what happened to his two children.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And so can you imagine Moses, like, I just told you this,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and you're, you know, right after you just saw what happened,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   and you're going to disobey?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   How come you didn't eat it?
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   That's the scene that we see in chapter 12, chapter 10, 12-20.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Just to get a better understanding of this,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   in the case of sin offering, the right to eat meat
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   was dependent upon where the blood was sprinkled.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   It was very specific.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   So if the blood was smeared inside the tent of meeting,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   the animal's carcass was burned outside the camp.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   If, however, the blood was smeared on the altar of the burnt offering,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   outside the tent meeting, the priests were entitled to eat the meat.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   So again, these instructions are so specific.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   If they were smeared in the tent, it meant that this was not to be eaten.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   This was to be taken out, not to be touched.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   But if it was smeared on the altar, the priests were commanded
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   that they are to eat this within.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   But this is the part where they didn't follow.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   They did the other two, but on the third one, they didn't eat.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   So as a result of that, Moses is angered,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   because it seemed like Aaron and his sons again dishonored God
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   by not following his direction.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   So if you look at verse 19, "And Aaron said to Moses,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   'Behold, today they have offered their sin offering
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and their burnt offering before the Lord,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   and yet such things as these have happened to me.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   If I have eaten the sin offering today, would the Lord have approved?'"
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   So in other words, Aaron is saying,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   it wasn't because I was being irreverent or dishonored God.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   It was because of what they experienced with Nadab and Abihu,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   that they said they were giving burnt offering and sin offering,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and because they did it wrong, they died.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And so in other words, Aaron was saying,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   it wasn't because we didn't fear God, it was because we feared God
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   that we were being cautious.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   So even though he didn't obey, he said, "Well, we wanted to,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   but look what happened today."
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And they were in the context of giving the sin offering,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   and the offering, and because they did it wrong.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   So we didn't want to get it wrong, and we didn't want to die.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   And that answer sufficed Moses.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And the reason why it sufficed Moses was because
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   the whole point of this was for God to be shown holy.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   God said that they were punished
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   because they didn't honor God as holy.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And so Aaron, on the surface, looked like he was dishonoring God,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and again, not having reverence toward God,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   but Aaron's answer basically flipped that script around and said,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   "No, it was because I was afraid.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   It was because we were recognizing it as holy."
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And as a result of that, they're allowed to go about their business.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Now that's the story of Nadab and Abihu, chapter 10.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   The significance of this is so important
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   because you and I have been studying the detailed information
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   that God has been giving in the book of Leviticus
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   about how do sinful people--
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   how are they in the presence of a holy God?
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Is there a reflection of this in the New Testament?
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Turn to Acts, chapter 5.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   If you turn to Acts, chapter 5,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Leviticus is the ratification of the first covenant.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   God gives the law, and then he gives the tabernacle,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   and then he gives the rules on how to approach God.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And then so chapter 10 basically is the beginning
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   of a relationship with the holy God and sinful people.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   God's presence coming, and then the very first encounter
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   of a holy God and sinful people ends in death.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Chapter 5 is where the Holy Spirit comes down in chapter 2,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   and the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   and the new covenant is inaugurated.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   So his church, right, his church which replaces the tabernacle
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   happens in Acts, chapter 2.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   The very first event that is recorded as a whole in chapter 5,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   if you guys know this story, Ananas and Sapphira,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   they sell their land, and then they lie to the church
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   saying that this is all of it, and the Holy Spirit reveals
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   that that's not the truth.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   It's only half of it, and as a result of it, what happens?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   They die.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Ananias, why have you lied to the Holy Spirit?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   And as a result of it, they die.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   So Sapphira comes and backs up her husband's story,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and as a result of that, they die.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   And so if you look at it, it says, verse 11,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things."
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Does that sound a lot like what we just read in chapter 10 of Leviticus?
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   It almost seems like it's mirroring, right?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Inauguration of the tabernacle leads to death,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   and fear probably came upon the nation of Israel,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and there was a sense of reverence.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Chapter 5, the church is inaugurated.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   The apostles, who function like the priests, kind of,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   because they were the ones initially sent to bring the gospel,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   and their first encounter in the church ends in death.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And as a result of that, there is great fear.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   This is in the New Testament.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   This is not the Old Testament. This is the New Testament.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   So this reverence toward the things of God,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   is it different in the New Testament?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   No, we don't die.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   If you look in the Old Testament,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   did people die immediately, as soon as they broke the law?
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   They did not, right?
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   But it happened in the inauguration.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Now, sometimes God will punish them immediately,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   sometimes it took a while, sometimes they lived for generations.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   But in the inauguration, it was made very clear that this is serious.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   In the inauguration of the church, we see the same thing.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   Fear comes upon them, and as a result, you would think that people would run.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   He said people were afraid to associate with the apostles because of this fear,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   but he said the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   So part of God's work, like the power of the gospel,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   and the power of the early church, is to recognize His presence.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   Because that's the whole point of the gospel,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   is not people, is not the small group, is not your leaders, is not the pastor,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   is to be reconciled to a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And you can't come to God on your terms.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   You cannot come to God on your terms.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   That is absolutely crystal clear.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   You can complain about the church, you can complain about the people,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   you can complain about the style of teaching,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   but you cannot come to God on your terms.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   If that was not clear in the Old Testament, it is absolutely clear in the New Testament.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   That's why Paul says when the Corinthians were divided and it was causing all kinds of chaos,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   remember what he says?
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   "Do you not know that you are the temple of God?"
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Now when he says that, what do you think he was--
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   the Israelites were thinking in their head?
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   A temple of God is nothing to be messed with.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   You think the nation of Israel ever forgot about what happened to Nadab and Nebihu?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   So when Paul says to the Corinthians,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   "You're treating the church as if it's not sacred,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   and you're willing to divide, allow all kinds of sins and chaos to come into the church,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   do you not know that your body is a temple of God?"
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   You have no reverence, right?
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Not recognizing that this is where God has chosen to dwell.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   This is his church. The head of the church is Christ.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   This is where he rules.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   We are the body. We are his hands.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   So the fact that you and I are somehow connected with Christ,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   in and of itself requires sacredness and reverence.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And so when the scripture says to live out your salvation with what?
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Fear and trembling.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   All this stuff is connected.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   All this stuff is connected. It's not out of the blue.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   This is what he's been teaching the nation of Israel.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   So when Christ came and he walked, that's why people had a hard time.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Because God was so distant and far.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   How can Jesus be God when he's among us?
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Because again, the idea that we have in the New Testament
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   is that we made Christ so pedestrian.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Like yes, he did serve. He was on his knees and he washed our feet.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   But the Christ that we see, that was a period when he humbled himself, became nothing.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   But so many people still have this image of Christ as a servant serving us.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Remember what it says in chapter 2?
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   He humbled himself, therefore, what does it say?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   God exalted him to the highest place.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   That every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Christ is Lord.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   He's not in that humble state.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   If you see Jesus coming in the second coming, how does he come?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   In his full glory. In his full glory.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   That's where he sits now.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   He came and humbled himself and served us and washed our feet to set an example.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   But because ultimately he came to take us to go to the cross and die for us and cover our sins.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   But Christ is our king.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   He's our God.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   He's our Lord. Not the other way.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And when we get that mixed up, that's when we start having problems of understanding where our purpose in life.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   The whole problem of mankind is that we try to put ourselves at the center.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   The answer to your sins and the answer to being right with God is recognizing that you and I are no longer at the center.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   And as much as sinful man comes to God kicking and screaming, the moment you are no longer at the center of your life, you are free.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   You are free.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Not recognizing the bondage of mankind is this lust of wanting to feed this flesh to be at the center.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   But the moment you let go and you die, you are free.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   And even as Christians, the greatest freedom is when you are lost in Christ.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Those aren't just words. That's the reality.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   When you recognize who he is, and in light of recognizing who you are, and you no longer matter.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Really, you no longer matter.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   And that kind of sounds like, "Well, that kind of sounds like God doesn't care."
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   No. That's what God is telling us. He cared for us so much.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   He's telling us the way to live is to die.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Okay, I have a couple of few verses that I want to give to you before.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Again, the seriousness of...
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Let me just read a few verses. 1 Peter 4, 17, "For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   And if this begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?"
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Again, a sense of seriousness.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   The word "glory" basically means something weighty, heavy.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   There needs to be a sense of heaviness in the way we approach God.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   There needs to be a sense of heaviness in the way we read his scripture.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   There has to be a sense of heaviness in the church.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   That we are not to run this church any way we please.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And that's why the first vision of our church is God-centered worship, not man-centered.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   We don't make decisions based upon what may make you the happiest.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   There are some things that you say, "Well, if we did this, it would be so much better.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   If we did this, so many people would be satisfied. And if we keep it like this, keep it like that."
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Well, not to say that those things aren't important, but it's not central.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   The central thing that we're concerned about is how is God honored.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   How is God honored?
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   That's the backbone of any church, not just Beroean Community Church, any church.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Because it's not our church. It's his church.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   So there has to be a weightiness in that.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   The first thing that he says before we're so concerned about the world,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   he says make sure that the church is his church first.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   We can't make salvation of the world primary.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   I hope that makes sense to you.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Salvation of the world is not primary. God's glory is the primary.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   It's the primary because he's the one who's offended.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   He's the one who's been offended, not the world.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   He's the one that we need to appease.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   He's the one we need to worship. He's the one that we need to be concerned about.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   And so a part of worshiping God means to obey and go to the remotest part of the world and bring them to him.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   But primary is him.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   So honoring God in the church, honoring God in my life is primary.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Not how you feel, not who likes you, not who reached out to you, who didn't reach out to you,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   or how you feel at church, that's not primary.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Primary is God being worshipped and honored in our lives.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   James 3.1, "Not many of you should become teachers, my brother,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness."
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   So if we're going to make God primary, we need to make sure that the leaders who represent the church
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   are first and foremost people who have reverence toward the things of God.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   That they need to understand the weightiness of what it is.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   So therefore, all this other stuff about being above reproach and able to teach,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   all of these things are all summarized in what's being said here.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   Leadership is not something to covet, because leadership means that there is a stricter judgment that comes upon you.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   The closer you are to God, more is required.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Even if it's positionally.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Now obviously, we're all children of God, but to be a leader in the church,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   to represent the holy presence of God in the church, because there's greater damage when you sin.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   It's one thing for a Christian to sin, "Oh, that guy's a pastor and he's doing that?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   That guy's an elder and he's doing that? That guy's a deacon and he's doing that?"
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   Because it reflects poorly on God, a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   So there may be a high view of God, means high view of church, means high view of leadership.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   So we don't just plug people in, because there's a need.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   So they might get things done and maybe things will go smoother,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   but our ultimate goal is not to make sure everything goes smoother.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Our ultimate goal is to make sure that God is being honored.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Even if all the logistics in the church falls apart, we need to make sure that God is honored, first and foremost.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   And we can't do that if we don't have a high view of God, high view of church, high view of leadership.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   And then Luke 12, 48, again, as I said, "But the one who did not know and did what deserved the beating
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   and from him to him they entrusted much, they will demand more."
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Again, to have a high view of God, high view of the church, high view of leadership,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   and high view of fellowship, high view of his word, right?
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Anything that is related to God, there has to be a sense of reverence.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   I hope that really came through in today's study.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Because generally as a whole, people in our culture where you and I live, it's just missing.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   And that's why one of the most primary questions that people get is,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   "If God is so loving, why does he not do this?"
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   You see how that question in and of itself would be offensive to a holy God?
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Where we offended him, we're the ones deserving of judgment,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   he sends his only begotten son to cover us with his blood,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   and then we question him for not obeying and listening to us.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   You see how offensive that questioning in and of itself would be?
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Because that question in and of itself is revealing that we know nothing of this God.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   Because if we knew anything of this God, there would be trembling and fear.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   How? Because that's exactly what it says in the book of Revelation.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   When Christ comes, what happens to the sinners?
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   They run to the hills and they hide.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   They hide because they're terrified of his presence.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   And that's how God is revealed to us in the scriptures.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   And that's why when we talk about the blood of Christ covering, what does he cover us?
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   He covers us to protect us from what? From the wrath of God.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   From God's own wrath, we are covered by his blood.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   So again, the questions that, some of it I already talked about.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   Considering what we have studied today, what do you think should be the most important quality of any leader in the church?
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   I kind of mentioned it, but it takes some time to discuss that.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Do you think there is enough reverence for the things of God in the way you practice your Christian life?
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Why or why not?
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   And again, I hear all the time people saying like, you know, like arguing adamantly about gray areas.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   And my point is not to talk about the gray areas of where you should or should not.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Right.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   If you live your whole life where it might or might not be OK with God.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   That in and of itself already already tells you you're not considering God.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   If I knew who God was, I want to make sure that my life, my whole life is lived in white.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   What I know to be white.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   You understand what I'm saying? If you really knew who God was.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Yes, we have freedom in Christ. And I think that I think it's very dangerous to start identifying that this is sin.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   This is not sin. And and start to decipher for people.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   But the whole point of arguing for gray area already tells you that that person has no understanding of who it is that they worship.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Right.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   In what way does our reverence show in the way that we think, the way we make decisions, how we live our life?
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Three, if the church is the New Testament temple of God and the corporate worship that our most important act of sacrifice we give to God.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   How should we treat it with greater reverence?
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Are we nonchalant about the way we worship God?
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Are we irreverent? Do we recognize that we're coming into his holy presence?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   And I know I mentioned this several times before, but the corporate worship is probably the most sacred time for any Christian.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   Right. Because that's where we it's it's more sacred than your personal worship.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   So is the most sacred thing that any Christian does in his life after he becomes a Christian.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Is that something that that you think that you are you are you recognize and revere?
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Be specific. And then number four, how do you strike a balance between First John 418 and Philippians 2.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   So Philippians 2 tells us to live out your life with fear and trembling.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   First John 418 says love casts out fear. Right.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   So I sometimes I hear people quoting one verse over the other and then back and forth.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   And and obviously they're both in scripture. What does that mean? How do you balance that?
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   You know, like do we live our life constantly in fear that God's going to judge us?
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   And obviously we said love casts out fear. And then you have the other side where it says, well, God loves me.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   So there is no judgment. I do whatever I want because that's what the scripture says.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   And yet the scripture says, live out your salvation with fear and trembling. Right.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   And we see that we see that not only in the Old Testament, even in the New Testament.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   So how do we balance that? Right. How do you apply that practically where where one or the other is not being ignored?
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Right. So let me pray for us. Then I'll release you to your small group.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   Heavenly Father, we ask for clarity.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   We know that this is something that we don't fully understand.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   We've only seen a glimpse of your glory, of your holiness, Lord God, of what you've told us and what we've seen in scripture.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   And maybe to various degrees, Lord God. That we understand and we've encountered you.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   But even in our deepest understanding, Lord, we are so far.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize what it is to fall short of your glory.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   And what it is to be restored to that glory.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   To understand the grace that we're in and the gospel that you've given us, that we truly may live worthy of this gospel.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   I pray for our church. I pray for our individual brothers and sisters.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   That a sense of reverence, of holiness and your presence, Lord God, would change our mindset that we would no longer live for ourselves, but for Christ.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   That glorifying Christ and pointing to who he is may be our life, our joy, our comfort, our salvation.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   So what we are weak in doing by our own flesh, we pray your Holy Spirit would lead and guide us.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   Bless our time, Lord God, as we have our time of discussion. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
