[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I almost said good morning.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Good evening, church family.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Happy New Year, at least early New Year.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   We're gonna go ahead and start our worship.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And it's just glad to see so many of you come out for our service.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   We're gonna start this first song by Pastor Mark's request.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's an old school song.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   So maybe those of you who've grown up in the church will know it.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Maybe some of you may not, but it kind of goes right in line with today's message.

[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Let's take a moment to pray together as we open up the service and dedicate this time to the Lord.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Our God, we want to join our hearts in, Lord, lifting up our song to you.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   God, we want to make sure that we are in consideration of you, God,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   so that all the things that have happened in this past year, we give thanks to you from our hearts.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   But also, God, as we think about the year to come, Lord, that we want to bring our first moments
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   desiring God to offer our song and worship to you.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   We also pray, God, that in our thoughts of all the things we hope to happen and that we wish to occur,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   that we want to make sure that it all has to do with you, Lord.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   God, we want to thank you again, and we lift this time of worship to you, Lord, in Christ's name.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Amen.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Church family, let's all stand together.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   [music]
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   The cross.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   [music]
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   The cross before me, the world behind.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   No turning back, raise the banner high.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It's not for me, it's all for you.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   [music]
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Let the heavens shake and split the sky.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Let the people clap their hands and cry.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   It's not for us, it's all for you.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Singing out, not to us.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Not to us, but to your name be the glory.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Not to us, but to your name be the glory.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   [music]
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Our hearts unfold.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Our hearts unfold before your throne.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   The only place for those who know.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   It's not for us, it's all for you.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   [music]
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Send your holy fire on this offering.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Let our worship burn for the world to see.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   It's not for us, it's all for you.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Yes, Lord.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Not to us, but to your name be the glory.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Not to us, but to your name be the glory.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   [music]
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   One more time, the cross before.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   The cross before me, the world behind.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   No turning back, raise the banner high.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   It's not for me, it's all for you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Yes, let the heaven.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Let the heaven shake and split the sky.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Let the people clap their hands and cry.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   It's not for us, it's all for you.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Not to us.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Not to us, but to your name be the glory.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Not to us, but to your name be the glory.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   One more time, not to us, but to your name be the glory.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Not to us, but to your name be the glory.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   [music]
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Amen.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   [music]
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   In Christ alone my hope is found.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   He is my light, my strength, my song.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   This cornerstone, this solid ground.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   What heights of love, what depths of peace.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   When fears are stilled, when strivings cease.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   My comforter, my all in all.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Here in the love of Christ I'll stand.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   [music]
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   In Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless bay.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   This gift of love and righteousness.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Scorned by the ones he came to save.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Till on that cross as Jesus died. The wrath of God was satisfied.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   For every sin on him was laid. Here in the death of Christ I lay.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   [music]
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   There in the ground his body lay.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Light of the world by darkness slain.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Then bursting forth in glorious day.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Up from the grave he rose again.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And as he stands in victory.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Sin's curse has lost its grip on me.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   For I am his and he is mine.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   No guilt in life, no guilt in life.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   No fear in death.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   This is the power of Christ in me.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   From life's first cry to final breath.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Jesus commands my death.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   No power of hell, no power of hell.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   No scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Till he returns or calls me home.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Here in the power of Christ.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   One more time, no power.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   No power of hell, no scheme of man.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Can ever pluck me from his hand.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Till he returns or calls me home.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Here in the power of Christ.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Amen.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   You may be seated.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Apologies for the slow delay in coming up to pray.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   I'm sorry we haven't sung that song in a long time.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   I got lost in the moment kind of thing.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   As we conclude the year and we think about the next year to
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   come.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   A time definitely goes really fast and we want to make sure
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   that we are being intentional about every season of our lives.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And so what a sweet time it is for us to come together.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Give God worship and focus our mind and hearts.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   In order to do that, let's take our Bibles and turn to Psalm
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   chapter 27.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   We are going to be taking a look at an important Psalm.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   This is a Psalm actually in the Jewish tradition that they read
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   every year at the beginning of the new year.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Some of you may have heard the Jewish holiday, Rosh Hashanah.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And that is the head of the year, the beginning of the year in
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   September for the Jewish tradition.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And this chapter, actually chapters 26, 27 and 28 are the
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   portions of scripture that are read every year.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And rightly so, it has so much to do with our focus and our
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   attention being given unto God.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I'm going to read for us verses 1-4.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And the word of God says this, a Psalm of David.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   The Lord is the defense of my life, whom shall I dread?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   When evil doers came upon me to devour my flesh, my adversaries
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   The host encamp against me, my heart will not fear.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   The war arise against me, in spite of this, I shall be confident.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   One thing I have asked from the Lord, that I shall seek, that I
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   behold the beauty of the Lord and to meditate in his temple.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Let's pray.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Our God, we do pray, Lord, that as time truly is short and goes
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   by so quickly, that God, as you have afforded time to us, have
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   given to us and allowed us to redeem the times, I really do
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   pray, Father, that we make most of it.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   That, God, we would fill it with time that is in communion and
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   fellowship with you.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And God, it is time spent desiring, Lord God, to exalt you
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   and to serve you in our life.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And I want to, Lord, thank you so much, Lord, that God, you
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   grant to us so much in Christ.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And so I pray that every day of our lives would truly be filled
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   and would be fruitful because of our walk with him.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   We thank you, God, for this time it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   So as I read that passage, you know, the psalm in its totality,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I'm going to walk down with you.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   There are four sections within this and I'm only going to be
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   able to cover certain segments of it because of the due to time
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   constraints.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   But this psalm has so much to do with God's design that his
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   ultimate redemptive desire was to make sure that he's dwelling
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   with his people, right?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And in order that he would dwell with his people, he had to
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   prepare them.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   He had to make sure that they were taught, that they were
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   taught to come and approach him in a right way.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And essentially the people in their dedication and expression
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and response to God would be to say, as you have called us, here
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   we are.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   We will approach you and we will seek you.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   We will seek your face.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And so this passage in the scriptures has much to do with
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   the people preparing and dedicating themselves and that's
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   why it's rehearsed.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   That's why there's a tradition of reading it each year.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And so for us, likewise, we're going to be taking a look so
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   that we would prepare our hearts and our minds as we think about
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   the year to come.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Now, the first segment of it, verses 1 through 3, let me read
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   again for us so that we can highlight and draw from it a
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   significant point about how we can prepare our hearts and our
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   minds.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   It says, "The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Whom shall I fear?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   The Lord is the defense of my life.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Whom shall I dread?"
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Excuse me.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   "When evil doers came upon me to devour my flesh, my adversaries
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Though a host encamp against me, my heart will not fear.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Though war arise against me, in spite of this, I shall be
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   confident."
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Now, we know that this kind of passage exists in so many
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   different arenas and portions of scripture.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   But in my mind, I look at this passage, it's not just kind of
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   fluffly talk of Psalms.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   It's actually very logical, isn't it?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   There is a spiritual logic that is being practiced and it is,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   "If the Lord truly is my light, my salvation, and my defense,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   then I should be able to ask this question, 'What in the
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   world am I going to be afraid of?'
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   If the Lord truly is my light that dispels all the fear that
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   resides in darkness.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   If he's my light who enlightens my eyes so that I could
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   understand, so that I could see, that I'm not just walking
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   around in ignorance.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   If he truly is my hope of rescue, deliverance from all the
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   things that I'm so afraid of.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   If he truly is my defense, where he is my strong tower and my
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   refuge."
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   The Hebrew word for defense there literally is strong and
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   then a place to flee.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   "He's my security.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   If he's like that, then who else am I supposed to fear?"
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And the resounding answer to that rhetorical question should
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   be, "No one.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Who else am I going to be in dread of?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Nobody.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   I'm not afraid of anybody."
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Now the question to you then is, "Are you able to say that in
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   that kind of confidence?"
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   That to me sounds like a kind of confidence where if I were to
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   hear it from anybody just talking to them, like, "I fear
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   nobody."
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It may even sound like pride.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   It may even sound like arrogance, wouldn't it?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   But the scripture is so clear actually that he is confident in
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   relationship to everything that is both past, present, and
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   future.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Take a look.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   If you look at verse 2, he says, "When evil doers came upon me."
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   That was his past.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   He had so many people that tried to get rid of him from the face
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   of the earth.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   We don't have time to recount all the little elements of his
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   history, but you know King Saul was threatened by David and so
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   wanted to kill him.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   And every time King David was praised, he was exalted or
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   people recognized him.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   King Saul was so jealous he literally, you know, threw
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   spears.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   He chased him down.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   All the things of the past, he says, "And whenever these things
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   happen, I still am confident."
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Verse 3, "Though a host encamp against me, my heart will not
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   fear.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Though a war arise against me, in spite of this, I shall be
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   confident."
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And so the first point is in a way to prepare for not just one
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   season but every year, we should be thinking, am I predetermined
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   to have confidence in God?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Do I understand what it means where I'm not like wary of
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   sounding all arrogant and prideful by saying I feel like I
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   can go through anything because God is my light, because God is
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   my salvation, and he's my defense.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I think a lot of people wrestle with the balance of how to have
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   confidence, right?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I know I do.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Because truthfully speaking, when I think to myself, this
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   scripture, King David is saying, "In spite of all this, I will
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   be confident."
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   I don't know if I'm -- am I allowed to say that?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And truthfully speaking, when I think, "Oh, Mark, you need to
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   be confident," you know, when you're afraid to speak in public
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   or when you're afraid to do X, Y, and Z, it's very difficult for
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   me to not get this weird thought in my head on this like wrong
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   side where it's like, "That's right, you're the man.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   You can do it."
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   It's hard for me to not think that way.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   But Christian confidence is nothing like that.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   King David did not put down into words, "And I am the man.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   I'm the best king in all of history."
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Christian confidence, biblical confidence is not arrogance.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   It's not being full of self, and it's not having a kind of gusto.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Christian confidence also is not this naive, what I see in
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   culture, which is, "You know what?
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   It'll all work out."
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   A kind of chance confidence in circumstances that are going to
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   just work in the strange, strange mystical world of
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   spirituality, and whabam, you're going to be okay.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   You know that's not the case.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   What King David is talking about here is this deep, deep trust.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   The word when he says, "And I shall be confident," in spite
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   of all these things, "I will be confident," is the word batakh,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   and it is translated 35 times as the word trust.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   For us, we know that it's not about a man who's just bold,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   who says what's on his mind, he fears nobody, and he just does
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   it, right?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   It's not a guy who has strong muscles, and he happens to be
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   just this weathered man who's been through life.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Why?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Because biblically speaking, a child can have biblical
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   confidence.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   My God is so big, he's so strong and so mighty, there's nothing
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   that he cannot do.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Bam, bam.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   And that's it.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And I have to get myself to realize my ideas of confidence
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   perhaps has been very much influenced by the world's idea
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   of machismo kind of thing, but actually, when you are able to
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   place such a confidence on the God who gives you security, and
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   therefore you're able to say, "In God, I am so confident,"
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   whether it was people of the past who are trying to devour
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   me, whether it's people now, whether--and then I'm going to
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   walk and highlight a couple passages to you.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Look further on Psalm 27, and--sorry.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   And take a look at verse 6.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   He says that there were enemies who were around him.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   If you take a look at verse 10, he says, "My father and my
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   mother have forsaken me."
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   If you take a look at verse 11, he says, "Teach me your ways
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   because of all of my foes."
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Take a look at verse 12, "There are adversaries and false
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   witnesses."
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And I could just go down, but what I'm trying to tell you is
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   there were all sorts of difficulties, trials, and
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   temptations.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   But the confidence is--does it really matter what it is?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Does it really matter what's happened?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Does it really matter what's going to be in the next year?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Because when you are predetermined, when you have
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   prepared your heart and your mind to say that, "I'm going to
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   be absolutely confident in my God," then it actually doesn't
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   even matter because you've already answered the question,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   "Who in the world am I going to fear when I have this God?"
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Amen?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And so for us, when we think about preparing, we've got to
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   be able to say, "Look, King David, I've been through
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   things, yes, but it's actually not my experience that makes me
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   weathered and prepared.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   From my experience, I just have greater confidence.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   God has proven himself in the past.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   I know he's going to be true now, and in the future, I shall
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   trust."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Amen?
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And likewise, secondly, not only then do we put our
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   confidence in the Lord, we put our focus in the Lord.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Let's take a look at the next section of this passage.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Starting from verse 4, we have a longer segment here where he
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   says, "One thing I have asked from the Lord that I shall seek,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   that I may dwell in the house of my Lord all the days of my
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to meditate in his
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   temple.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   For in the day of trouble, he will conceal me in his
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   tabernacle.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   In the secret place of his tent, he will hide me, and he will
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   lift me up on a rock.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord."
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Great.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   So we're going to have this slide up here.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I want you to just kind of stare at this verse and all that it's
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   talking about.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I want us to think about this idea that in order to prepare
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   your mind for whatever is to come in the next year, there has
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   to be focus.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Anytime you're preparing for a game, an endeavor of a project,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   teamwork, whatever it may be, we have to make sure that we are
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   goal-oriented, right?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Well, what King David says here is, "There is something that I've
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   asked for and that something is singular."
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   There is one thing, what focus.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And what he says is, "I have asked in the past," it was a past
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   perfect, "but I also continually seek," it's an imperfect.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And then later on, if you look at your Bibles, in verse 8, he
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   says, "When you said, 'Seek my face,' my heart said to you,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   'Your face, Lord, I shall seek.'"
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   I love that.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Why?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Because there's such a clear focus.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   This is what I know exactly that you want.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Therefore, my response to you is, "I will seek your face."
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   And so here come some questions for us.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   For us, when we think about, like, resolve, when you think
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   about being dedicated, right?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   What you're doing is actually you're focusing and honing your
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   intention so that all the different distractions that are
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   coming your way don't take the place of that thing that is
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   reserved for God.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   There is a need for us to have a more singular focus in our
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   lives.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And the things that King David says is, "I want to make sure
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   that I dwell in your house all the days of my life.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   If there is something that I've repeatedly asked you, if
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   something that I'm going to ask you now is going to be that I
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   may behold your beauty, and it's so that I can meditate in your
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   temple," which is to say in your presence.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   If you notice up here in this passage, I started highlighting
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   a couple things, and one of the things is in orange, it's so
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   kind of like jumps out at you, which is he's repeatedly talking
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   about God's presence in his temple, in his secret place, in
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   his tent, right, in his tabernacle.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   What he's preoccupied by is the presence of God.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   One of the things I think that has been a trend in modern day
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   -- have you guys used the term like "veg out"?
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   You know, you have a long day of work and you just want to veg
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   out, right?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   You want to sit on that sofa.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   You know what's really interesting is people nowadays
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   long to be distracted.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Isn't that weird?
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   They want to have like Facebook and YouTube give them just 20
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   seconds, just, you know, fun laughs, little pranks and stuff
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   like that.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   And people just want to kind of let their mind coast and drift.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And the funny thing about it is that actually can just fill you.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   So you're not even just kind of like tasting some of these
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   things they're throwing at you.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Some people can lose themselves within it and be actually
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   preoccupied with the distraction.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Strange.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   It's a strange thing.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   For us, if we're trying to be intentional, we have to make
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   sure that we are pre-decided.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   We are pre-determined to focus on the Lord, to seek the goal of
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   being in his presence, to seek the good of meditating on his
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   beauty, and we want to be engrossed in it.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   We want to be so engrossed in it that if we're actually losing
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   sight of something, if we're actually trying to forget about
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   other things, if we're trying to actually put our minds away
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   from the stress and away from the hardships and et cetera, et
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   cetera, you want to be so engrossed in God that everything
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   seems to dissipate.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   You know, as I think about this, there have been times, and you
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   guys have probably experienced, where you're so engrossed in a
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   movie, you're so engrossed in a game, that whatever anybody else
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   does, you don't really notice, right?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And those are some times when we love playing pranks on each
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   other.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   There are some times actually when we're sitting in the cafe
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   or whatever, I just like to kind of joke around and I lean over
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   and you guys know I really, really like sweets.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   I'll try to steal someone's sweets if they have it.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   If they have a donut, I'll be like, "Look over there," and I
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   grab it.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Or if they have a cookie, I'll say, "Hey, look over there,"
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   and then--what's best is if they're already like preoccupied
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   doing something during a meeting and I just kind of slowly like
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   sneak my hand over and grab a cookie.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Now, the fun moments about playing pranks like that is when
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   someone's like, "Hey, what is that?"
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   You know, da, da, da, da, da.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   You know when it's not fun?
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   If they're so engrossed in the meeting and they don't notice.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   You know what's not fun?
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   If they're so engrossed in whatever they're doing, they're
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   just kind of like, "Meh, whatever," right?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   What's the fun in stealing from somebody who doesn't care
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   whether you steal it, right?
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   What I think is our enemy, the world, they get a kick out of
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   giving you--getting a rise out of you when they can distract
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   you.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   They get a kick out of when they can bring out, like, whatever
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   it is that you're doing, whatever it is that you're, you
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   know, trying to focus on.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   If they can get you so distracted and get a rise out of
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   you, that's so much fun.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And then another part of that is, how sad because all Satan has
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   to do is play a little game, play a little prank, get you
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   distracted, and in many ways, he's won.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   What I'm trying to focus in on and hone in on here is to say,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   in order to prepare our minds, we have to make sure that we
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   are already preparing a kind of goal-centered focus that there's
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   going to be one singular thing that I'm pursuing, and it has to
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   be the face of God, right?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And so I want to challenge you and ask you the questions.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Have you been following modern trends of trying to distract
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   yourself?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Have you been trying to do so many different things, or have
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   you been preoccupying yourself with the things of God that
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   you're engrossed in, amen?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Finally, let's move towards another section of the passage,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   and the point I want to make to you is that not only are you
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   going to be predetermined and preoccupied with the things of
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   God, but we have to be pre-decided.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I think when I think about my tendencies, I do have a lot of
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   fears.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Last Sunday sermon when Pastor Nate preached about fears, it
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   hit me heavily.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   There are a lot of worries and fears, and because I'm regularly
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   worried about making wrong decisions, I always wait to make
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   decisions.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   "We'll see when we get there.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   I'll see after I take a good look at all my options," and then
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   hopefully after waiting and considering and thinking and
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   beating that thing to death, I'll pick the best ones.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   But Scripture, I believe, actually calls us to make
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   predetermined decisions in our heads.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Predetermined decisions in our minds, "I'm going to always do
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   it God's way," right?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   I don't have to reinvent and re-go through every process,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   every single moment with every single decision.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Why?
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Because there are certain things, whatever may come, I've
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   already decided how this is going to play out because I've
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   already decided that I'm going to do things the Lord's way.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Why do I say this?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Take a look at this next passage from verse 11 through 13, and
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   what he says is, "Teach me your way, O Lord, and lead me in
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   level paths," right?
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   If you're asking God, "Show me what you desire.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Show me how you operate.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Tell me how you do things," that must mean your heart has
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   already decided, "And I'm going to do it," right?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   If you say, "Lead me and show me exactly where to go," but you
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   respond with, "Maybe I'll think about taking it one day," that's
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   not really a question then, is it?
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   But we have to be as predetermined.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   You know, what makes me think about it is, it makes me think
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   about those moments, let's say you're going to buy a car.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   You have to go into that dealership predetermined.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   I'm not going to fall for your games.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   I don't need no extended warranty on something that's going to
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   break.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   I don't need this extra thing deal that you're going to, you
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   know, sell to me about sealants and protective this and coats
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   and why?
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Because you know what's coming at you.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   The world is going to pitch you.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   The world is going to sell you.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   There are already things you have to go predetermined going
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   into that dealership, otherwise you're going to get played.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Yes?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   What I'm trying to say here is within this passage, not only
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   are we supposed to be, again, predetermined but preoccupied,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   but we're going to be pre-decided to do things God's
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   way and to wait on him.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Take a look.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   He continues and goes on to say, "Because of my foes, do not
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, for false
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   witnesses have risen against me and such as breathe out
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   violence.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I would have despaired unless I had believed that I would see
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Wait for the Lord.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Be strong.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Let your heart take courage.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Yes, wait for the Lord."
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   You see, we know.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   We know that there are going to be things that come our way this
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   next year.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   I don't know, you know, like if you have certain resolutions
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   set, you have high hopes of the things that you want to
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   accomplish.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   I'm pretty sure that the next year is going to be a mixed bag.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   You're going to have things that are incredibly successful,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   fruitful, and good, and then you'll have things that are
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   incredibly disappointing.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   But nevertheless, we're going to have a barrage of both good
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   and bad, distractions, fruitful things, and it's going to be
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   all a mix.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   And within that, I'm challenging you, our strength is going to be
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   coming from a predetermined, pre-decided heart where the will
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   is strong.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   I'm going to make sure that rather than in the moment
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   feeling like I need things fixed, done, and manageable now,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I'm going to wait on the Lord.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   I'm going to pre-decide the way of God is better, better than
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   conventional wisdom, better than my own wisdom, better than
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   everybody else's wisdom.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   And requesting that God teach me is going to come from a pure
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   hearted request because I have already decided that's exactly
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   what I'm going to do.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   You see, the reason why I'm talking about this is because I
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   do feel like as I hear Christian lingo and sometimes people talk
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   about different, I guess, you know, thoughts they have of
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   preparing for the future, et cetera, I have seen a lot of
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Christians actually say that as the New Year's come around, that
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   they're not going to make New Year's resolutions, that they're
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   not going to make strong resolves.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Why?
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Because it kind of sets you up for failure.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   If you're going to say, "Oh, I resolve to do X, Y, and Z," then
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   X, Y, and Z can go all south from there.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   But actually, the problem is not that we make resolutions and
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   that we need to not set ourselves up for failure or that we're
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   being legalist by doing that, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   What we need actually is to prepare better.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   What we need actually is to make sure that we're preoccupied,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   predetermined, and pre-decided that this is what we're going to
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   do, that we're going to fix our sights on God and that our
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   strength is going to come from our trust in him.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Amen?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Let's take a moment to pray over this.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Heavenly Father, we take a moment to collectively bow our heads
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   and God, render to you the desire of our heart.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Lord, the longing of our heart truly is that we would experience
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   the goodness of being close to you every single day.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   I pray, Father God, that it would be our great ambition to
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   walk with you in such a way that we feel the intimacy of having a
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   relationship with you.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And I pray, Father God, that we would regularly experience also
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   the wonder of knowing you and beholding your greatness.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Lord, you know very well that we are a people who will become
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   easily distracted.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   You know, Father God, and we know ourselves that we are a
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   people who easily forget.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   But it is our prayer that truly you would help us to stay on the
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   narrow path.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   God, that we would be walking according to your way.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   And Lord, I ask God that though we may have moments of failure,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Lord, that our confidence would not come because we had a track
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   record that's so good.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Our confidence would come because you are so mighty.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Lord, I pray that our trust would truly be based on you,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   founded in you.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   And God, that our hope would be set upon you, Lord.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And so I ask God that regardless of how this past year has been,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Lord, we would look past in this last year with great thankfulness
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   of all that you have done.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   And God, we eagerly also look forward to all the things that
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   you have in store in the next year.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   God, we thank you it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Okay, at this time as we do think about closing the year,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   we are thankful for our media team.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   They have prepared a slide show and video presentation for us.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   Reviewing some of the things and the ways that God has worked in
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   our community.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   So we are going to put up the video for you, please enjoy.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   And afterwards I will come back up and lead us in a time of brief
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   prayer to conclude this evening out.

[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   All right, thank you again to the media team for prepping that slideshow.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   A lot of things that's happened in our church community.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   So, we now have about 10 minutes.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   Our hope and goal is that when midnight hits,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   we could all count down together in unison from 10.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   So, what we're going to do between here and then is we're going to come together.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   If you've come with your family, please go ahead and pray with your family.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   Otherwise, please join together with about three to four people
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   and just take time, one, to thank the Lord for everything that's happened.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   But two, you can share a little bit about how you personally could focus in a greater way on God.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Just share a request, how you're going to focus more on the Lord,
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   and then take time to pray for each other.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   After about 10 minutes, I'll call us together.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   We'll count down, say "woo," and then do the hugs, high fives,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   and then we'll end the evening that way, okay?
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   So, please at this time, please look around to each other,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   joining together in groups of three or four to pray.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   [Praying in silence]

[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   And then, after the service is over, you can continue to, if you got cut off in your prayer, pray for each other.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   Or you can continue to just fellowship and greet each other, okay?
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   So we'll give you just another about 10 seconds or so to greet each other.

[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   Heavenly Father, we again want to just thank you over and over again.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   God, to an undeserving people, you have been truly so good and great.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   Father, we can recount so many times you have been faithful, so many times you have lavished your love.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   And we pray that we will repeat again, Lord, that you have been so good and we thank you, Lord.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   Father, we pray that just like tonight, that the next year 2022 will be filled with regular times of worshipping you and praising you and exalting you.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   And I pray, Father God, that we will be so overjoyed to be meditating on your goodness, to be lifting up to you our song and rendering to you our heart.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   And I pray, Father God, that we would truly be a people that delights to spend every moment with you, Lord.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   I ask, Father God, that you would guard us and protect us.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   We know there are so many distractions and things that pull us away.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   But God, it is our desire to be faithful.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   That God, day in and day out, Lord, we are constantly searching for you.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   That God, we would be seeking you with all of our hearts.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   Lord, we want to thank you so much again.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   All right. Well, again, we want to wish you guys a happy new year.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   Stay safe on your drive home. Have a good evening, everyone.
