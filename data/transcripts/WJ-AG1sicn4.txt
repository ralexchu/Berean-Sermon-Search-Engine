[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.380]   And welcome to Bruin Community Church.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.380]   Let me start with a few announcements.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.380]   First of all, our Sprouts PTA meeting.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.380]   So if you have a child between the age of kindergarten
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.380]   to sixth grade, we have a PTA meeting that's happening
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.380]   at two o'clock today, so make sure you grab your lunch
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.380]   and then afterwards come here,
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.380]   hopefully a little bit before two,
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.380]   so they can get started right at nine a.m.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.380]   Nine, two p.m., I'm reading something else.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.380]   Okay, and there is childcare provided,
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.380]   so please let them know if you are able to come.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.380]   This coming Saturday, we have a men's quarterly fellowship
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.380]   that's happening from nine a.m. to about one o'clock.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.380]   And so please sign up for that.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.380]   Today is the last day for early registration,
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.380]   and so please go out, and if you're outside
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.380]   or if you can go to the app and sign up today,
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.380]   again, that's $10 for early registration,
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.380]   and then the cost will go up after that, $15.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.380]   So today is the last day for early registration, okay?
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.380]   So please do that.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.380]   And then college retreat, Roots of Redemption,
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.380]   is happening on March 21st through 23rd
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.380]   in Oakland Conference Center.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.380]   Pastor Eric Chabonet from Pillar Baptist Church
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.380]   is going to be coming and speaking on the subjects
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.380]   of Roots of Redemption.

[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.380]   And then Women's Ministry Tea Time,
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.380]   this has kind of saved the date.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.380]   It's a little bit further away,
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.380]   but on April 5th at 9:30 to 12 p.m.,
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.380]   ladies will be placed in various groups,
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.380]   mixed affinity groups, designated for homes,
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.380]   time of intentional fellowship,
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.380]   so please sign up for that.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:55.380]   Again, to save the date, on April 5th at 9:30 to 12 p.m., okay?
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.380]   All right, I'm going to pray for our offering,
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.380]   give you a minute to give your offering,
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.380]   and then afterwards, after our worship time,
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.380]   our sister Gracie Han is going to come up
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.380]   and give her testimony,
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.380]   and then she'll be baptized this morning.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.380]   Let's pray.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.380]   Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace and love.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.380]   Help us, Lord, to fix our eyes upon who you are
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.380]   and what you've given us,
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.380]   that all that we do would lead to greater worship,
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.380]   greater adoration of your name.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.380]   I pray that you would bless this time,
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.380]   and that even in our giving,
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.380]   that it would be given as an act of worship to you,
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.380]   and again, may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.380]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.700]   - Amen, you may be seated.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:44.700]   - Hi, everyone.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.700]   My name is Gracie, and this is my testimony.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.700]   Born into a Christian family and growing up in the church,
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.700]   I never once questioned my faith when I was younger.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.700]   I diligently memorized Bible verses,
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   prayed, and served in my home church's children's ministry,
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.700]   but it was all for show.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.700]   During middle and high school, I began to drift from church
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.700]   and placed my worth in my social life and academic success.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.700]   But as with all worldly pursuits,
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.700]   they left me unsatisfied, anxious, and lonely,
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   as I sought fulfillment in things
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.700]   that could never truly satisfy me.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.700]   Everything I valued felt like empty vanity,
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.700]   as none of it truly mattered.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.700]   Leading up to college, my heart was far from God,
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.700]   but I decided to join a mission trip to Spain
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.700]   with my home church.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.700]   Though my reasons were selfish,
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.700]   the Lord used the trip to soften my heart.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.700]   Seeing how the local Spanish Christians
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.700]   and Ukrainian children who had fled the war
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.700]   had so much joy and praise for the Lord
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.700]   despite having so little,
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.700]   I questioned why, despite my privileged life,
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.700]   I wasn't as happy.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.700]   I realized their peace came from knowing Christ's love,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.700]   which led me to take my faith more seriously,
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.700]   and I started attending Berean once I entered college.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.700]   Up until this point,
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.700]   I had never seriously thought about my salvation,
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.700]   so I just assumed I was a believer.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.700]   Starting college felt exciting,
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   and I experienced a false sense of happiness,
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.700]   convinced I had found the eternal joy
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.700]   that other believers spoke of.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.700]   This temporary euphoria quickly disappeared
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.700]   as I fell deep into sin.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.700]   I sought comfort in alcohol and other worldly pleasures,
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.700]   and for a fleeting moment, it really felt so good,
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.700]   almost like an escape from my pain and struggles.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.700]   But the temptations were deceiving,
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.700]   their sweet promises of happiness
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.700]   nothing more than illusions.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.700]   Each time I sank deeper into sin,
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.700]   I also sank deeper into depression,
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.700]   trapped in a relentless cycle.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.700]   I had turned to alcohol in hopes
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.700]   it would fill the gaping emptiness in my soul,
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.700]   a void so real it really felt like a hole in my chest.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.700]   But instead of relief, I found only hopelessness.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.700]   My heart grew hardened to any mention
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.700]   of the gospel or God's love,
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.700]   and I lost all will to live.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.700]   Every day brought the same torment,
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.700]   mindlessly going through the motions
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.700]   or surrendering to the darkness of my thoughts.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.700]   Life felt meaningless, stripped of hope and emotion,
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.700]   and the only escape I saw was to numb the pain.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.700]   At some point, I realized I no longer recognized myself
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.700]   and was afraid of the person I had become.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.700]   I withdrew from college,
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   hoping that time at home with my family
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.700]   would provide the rest and healing
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.700]   I needed before returning.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.700]   I spent these days reflecting on the past quarter and my sins,
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.700]   but my heart remained hardened to God's love,
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.700]   and I refused to repent.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.700]   A few weeks after returning to college last quarter,
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.700]   I began slipping back into the same depression
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.700]   that had driven me to leave school.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.700]   I was deeply discouraged,
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.700]   but it was during this time of brokenness
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.700]   that God began to open my eyes to my sin.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.700]   And for the first time in my life,
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.700]   I started to genuinely seek him out,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.700]   wanting to know what my purpose in life was
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.700]   and how I could find joy in him rather than in the world.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.700]   During this time,
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.700]   I began to feel true, genuine sorrow over my sin,
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.700]   for how could I have rebelled against God
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.700]   to the extent that I did,
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.700]   even after he had shown me so much grace
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   and love throughout my life?
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.700]   I am a sinner fully deserving of eternal punishment,
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.700]   but as Ephesians 2, 4-5 says,
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.700]   "But God, being rich in mercy,
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.700]   because of his great love with which he loved us,
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.700]   even when we were dead in our transgressions,
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.700]   made us alive together with Christ,
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.700]   by grace you have been saved."
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.700]   I was deserving of punishment,
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.700]   but Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.700]   offered himself as a sacrifice for our sin upon the cross
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.700]   so that we may be saved from eternal separation from God.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.700]   As it is written in Romans 8, 1-2,
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.700]   "Therefore there is now no condemnation
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.700]   for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.700]   for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.700]   has set you free from the law of sin and of death."
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.700]   Past prayers of ungratefulness and anger
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.700]   became prayers of genuine repentance and gratitude,
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.700]   and I felt a deep, indescribable sense of warmth wash over me.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.700]   The life I once lived,
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.700]   merely going through the motions,
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.700]   has been completely transformed.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.700]   I now have a genuine, eternal hope and joy in Christ,
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.700]   a hope living to enjoy God in all that he is
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.700]   and bring glory to him in everything that I do.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.700]   As Galatians 2-20 says,
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.700]   "I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.700]   and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.700]   In the life which I now live in the flesh,
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.700]   I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   who loved me and gave himself up for me."
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.700]   Praise and glory to God for his love and mercy
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.700]   and for giving me the gift of life
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.700]   to be his servant, living solely for him and his witness,
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.700]   exemplifying his glory in all that I do
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.700]   that others may see and know his true greatness.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.700]   For while life brings its struggles,
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.700]   the love found in Christ is far sweeter
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.700]   than anything this world can offer.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.700]   Even though I am imperfect and still continue to sin,
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.700]   I can have full confidence and trust
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.700]   in Christ's death and resurrection,
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.700]   that my sins are forgiven
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.700]   and I am covered by Christ's righteousness.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.700]   As Romans 5, 19-21 says,
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.700]   "For as through the one man's disobedience
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.700]   the many were made sinners,
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.700]   even so through the obedience of the one
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.700]   the many will be made righteous.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.700]   The law came in so that the transgression would increase,
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.700]   but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.700]   so that as sin reigned in death,
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.700]   even so grace would reign through righteousness
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.700]   to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.700]   Thank you.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:53.700]   [applause]
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:11.700]   Do you understand when you go into the water
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.700]   you're being united to Christ's death,
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.700]   and you're being united to his resurrected life?
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.700]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.700]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:35.700]   [applause]
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.700]   All right, thank you, Gracie, for that great testimony.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.700]   And I love your name, Gracie.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.700]   Pastor Nate's third child is Gracie.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.700]   If you could turn your Bibles with me
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.700]   to Luke 10, verse 17-20.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.700]   Okay.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.700]   Don't mind them, they're setting up for the communion.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.700]   Luke 10, verse 17-20.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.700]   It reads,
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.700]   "The seventy returned with joy, saying,
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.700]   'Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.'
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.700]   And he said to them,
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.700]   'I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.700]   Behold, I have given you authority
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.700]   to tread on serpents and scorpions
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   and over all the powers of the enemy,
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.700]   and nothing will injure you.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.700]   Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this,
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.700]   that the spirits are subject to you,
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.700]   but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.'"
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   Let's pray.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.700]   We thank you for the privilege to be able to come
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.700]   and to worship you.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.700]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.700]   the author and the perfecter of our faith,
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.700]   that your word would come alive to us,
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.700]   that your sheep will hear your voice and follow you.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.700]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.700]   As you guys know, just a few weeks ago,
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.700]   we just came back from our mission trip,
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.700]   and I would say in all the years that I've been in ministry,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.700]   some of our fondest memories were out in the mission field,
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.700]   you know, in the short term, coming back.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.700]   And it's always awesome to hear testimonies,
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.700]   and I love sitting with missionaries
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.700]   when they tell me stories about their experiences
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.700]   and what it was like and the people that they met.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.700]   And the many years that we've been coming in and out
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.700]   of different places, I remember the first time
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.700]   that we took our church into China,
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.700]   I think it was 1999.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.700]   And at that time, China was open,
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.700]   but there wasn't a lot of traffic coming in and out,
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.700]   so we've heard all these stories
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.700]   about how the underground churches were thriving
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.700]   and now that we can slowly begin to go.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.700]   And when we went in, there weren't a lot of churches
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   that was going in.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.700]   We had an opportunity.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.700]   Our denomination asked if we would come
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.700]   and run an English camp, and so we did.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.700]   And we were there for about two weeks,
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.700]   and there's maybe one or two people in this room
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.700]   that may have been there on our first trip,
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.700]   but that was probably one of the most memorable trips
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.700]   because we got there, and one of our team members
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.700]   got a little bit too aggressive in sharing the gospel.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.700]   And one of the students there, her name was Sophia,
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.700]   got offended, and she started questioning,
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.700]   "Why are you here? Who's your leader?
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.700]   What's your purpose?"
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.700]   And then we found out that she was a member
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.700]   of the Communist Party, but not only was she a member
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.700]   of the Communist Party, her job was to report
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.700]   what's going on locally.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.700]   And so her job was to write a report
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.700]   and then to turn it in.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.700]   So when we found out about that,
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.700]   we had probably the best prayer meeting that we've ever had
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.700]   because everybody was so scared, like, "What's going to happen?"
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.700]   They were asking me questions, "Should I burn
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.700]   all my quiet time notebook?"
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.700]   And one person even asked, "Should I throw in my Bible?"
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.700]   I said, "No. Hold on to that. We're going to pray.
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.700]   We're going to see what's going to happen."
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.700]   So I ended up switching out to her to teach that class,
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.700]   and after two weeks, not only did she not turn us in,
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.700]   she actually, at the end of the camp,
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.700]   asked me for a Bible.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.700]   And she said that she was so interested in Christianity
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.700]   that she wanted to go read more about it.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.700]   And obviously she didn't come to faith then,
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.700]   but to have a girl who was threatening to turn us in,
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.700]   and then at the end of the 2-week camp telling us
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.700]   that she is very interested about the Christian faith.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   And so early on, our mission work to China was so exciting
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.700]   because the doors were just beginning to open,
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.700]   and it was as ripe as any time I've ever experienced a ministry.
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.700]   It was in season.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.700]   It didn't take much to convince people to come to Christ.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.700]   Many of them grew up never hearing the gospel,
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.700]   had very prejudicial understanding of Christianity,
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.700]   but we were like the first Christians that they met,
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.700]   and so everything that we shared, they were so open.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.700]   I could tell you story after story, but for the sake of time,
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   but some of my fondest memories of ministry was that.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.700]   And I share all of this as an introduction to the text
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.700]   that we're looking at because, if you remember,
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.700]   in the beginning of Chapter 10, Jesus sends out the 70
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.700]   and sends them out two by two,
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.700]   and he gave them very specific instruction.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.700]   He didn't just go there and say, "Hey, go share the gospel."
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.700]   He said, "Go two by two.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.700]   Where I'm sending you is going to be dangerous.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.700]   You're going to be like lambs among wolves."
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.700]   After he tells them about the danger,
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.700]   instead of telling them to get ready, he says, "Don't take a staff.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.700]   Don't take anything that you're going to use to protect yourself."
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.700]   He instructed them, and it's not like when we go on trips,
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.700]   we have two weeks, and sometimes the longer trips
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.700]   are maybe three, three-and-a-half weeks.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.700]   This is during a time when they didn't have transportation,
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.700]   so if they were going from village to village,
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.700]   most likely their trips are anywhere from month to several months
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.700]   that they're out on the street, and this is not a situation
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.700]   where they can just go to a restaurant and use your credit card to pay.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.700]   If you didn't bring food with you, you're not eating.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.700]   Whatever you bring may last maybe a week or two,
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.700]   but there's no way they're going to be able to bring enough food for that journey.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.700]   In fact, Jesus tells them, "Don't bring anything.
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.700]   Don't bring an extra bed.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.700]   You're going to go on this journey where it's difficult.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.700]   You're going to be persecuted.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.700]   You're going to be like a lamb among wolves.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.700]   Don't take anything."
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.700]   He tells them that some of them are going to reject him.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.700]   He tells them, "Don't even sit around socializing
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.700]   because you're not here to make friends.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.700]   You're here to preach the gospel."
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.700]   If they receive you, bless them.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.700]   If they don't receive you, shake off the dust and move on.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.700]   And he told them that the primary message that you are to preach
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.700]   is about the kingdom of God.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.700]   It is to challenge the kingdom that they're in,
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.700]   so the message itself is going to be difficult for them.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.700]   Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.700]   So if they repent, they're going to welcome you.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.700]   If they don't repent, they're going to chase you out of the place
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.700]   and maybe even hurt you.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.700]   Expect to be rejected.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.700]   And in order to do that, he said, "Don't take any of this stuff."
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.700]   And he only told them that, "You go in my authority."
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.700]   And he told them, "I'm going to give you authority
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.700]   to cast out demons and heal the sick."
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.700]   And that's exactly what they do.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   They go out.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.700]   And the reason why Jesus told them all of that
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.700]   is so that they don't return and say, "You know what?
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.700]   We really had a good team.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.700]   We prepared well because we had some guys who were expert fishermen
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.700]   and so when we got hungry, they knew how to catch fish.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.700]   We had a baker among us, and so whenever we got hungry,
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.700]   he got all the weed and ground it up, and he was able to make bread,
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.700]   and that's how we survived."
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   One of our guys is an expert orator.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.700]   He knows how to speak, and he makes a point clear,
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.700]   and he's so interesting.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.700]   So they don't come back and say that, "We had a great team,
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.700]   so if we can just have this team wherever we go,
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.700]   I think we can be successful."
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.700]   And that's exactly what Jesus was trying to prevent,
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.700]   that they don't go there and come back and give credit to themselves
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.700]   or to other human beings.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.700]   They would come back and experience the power of God.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:55.700]   Jesus wanted them to see what kind of power that he has
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.700]   to be able to give to them, and that's exactly what happens.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.700]   They come back and say they were rejoicing.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:07.700]   They were rejoicing that even the demons are subject to us in your name,
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.700]   and that was the point.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.700]   We went out the way you told us to, taking nothing.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.700]   We had no power.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.700]   We didn't even have a staff.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.700]   We didn't even have extra food.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.700]   We didn't have extra clothes, and by your authority,
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.700]   that we were able to cast out demons.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.700]   Now, is that the only thing that they experienced?
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.700]   It tells us Jesus gave them power to heal the sick,
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.700]   but they don't mention that, right?
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.700]   Why was the casting out of the demons of all the things
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.700]   that they could have highlighted that?
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.700]   Because in that world, they were fully aware
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.700]   how powerless they were against the demonic world,
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.700]   and they knew that even the many diseases that they were struggling with,
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.700]   there were some demonic things attached to that.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.700]   And so if you're sick, maybe you can call a doctor.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.700]   Maybe if somebody is blind, maybe you can help them or give an assistance,
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.700]   but what do you do for a man who is demon-possessed?
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.700]   What do you do to a town when the demon has completely taken over?
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.700]   So they come back, and of all the things that they experienced,
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.700]   they said, "We rejoice."
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:16.700]   "We rejoice because in your name, we were even able to cast out demons.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   They were subject to us."
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.700]   In fact, in Colossians 1.13, our salvation is described
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:27.700]   as rescuing from the domain of darkness,
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.700]   transferring us to the kingdom of his Son.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.700]   So in their rejoicing, Jesus responds in verse 18.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.700]   He says to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning."
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.700]   He's describing to them what they experienced
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.700]   and why they were able to have this authority over the demons.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.700]   So I'm going to read you--it's a little bit lengthy,
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.700]   but there's two passages that if you haven't read it before,
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.700]   never heard it before, how Satan falls
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.700]   and why the demons are subject to him.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:01.700]   In Isaiah 14.12-15, it describes the fall of Satan.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.700]   It says, "How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning."
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.700]   "O star of the morning," literally in Hebrew, is "Lucifer,"
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.700]   and that's where we get the name "Lucifer."
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.700]   It's translated literally "star of morning,"
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.700]   but the word itself is "Lucifer."
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.700]   "O Lucifer, son of Don, you have been cut down to the earth.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.700]   You who have weakened a nation, but you said in your heart,
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.700]   'I will ascend to heaven. I will raise my throne above the stars of God.'"
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.700]   This is Satan saying, "I'm going to elevate myself
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.700]   so that I can touch his glory.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   I will sit on the mount of assembly in the recesses of the north.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.700]   I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.700]   I will make myself like the most high.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.700]   Nevertheless, you will be thrust down into Sheol to the recesses of the pit."
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.700]   And that describes his rebellion.
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.700]   Satan's whole rebellion was he saw the throne of God,
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   and he coveted it, and he did everything in his power
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.700]   to raise himself up, but the rebellion didn't work.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.700]   So as a result, the very opposite happens.
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.700]   Instead of exalting himself, he was humbled,
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.700]   and he was thrown down to the recesses of the pit.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.700]   So that's what happened to Satan.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.700]   So why does he have all these demons,
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.700]   the demonic forces under his control?
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.700]   Revelations 12, 7-9.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.700]   "There was a war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.700]   The dragon and his angels waged war, and they were not strong enough,
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.700]   and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.700]   When the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old,
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.700]   who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world,
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:37.700]   he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him."
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.700]   It doesn't say in this text, but it tells us in the other text
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.700]   that a third of the angels followed him.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.700]   It's just like if there was a rebellion,
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.700]   and the general, who had loyal soldiers,
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.700]   who backs him up and goes into this battle,
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.700]   but if he loses, then all the soldiers also go along with him.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.700]   They are expelled with the general.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.700]   That's basically what happened in heaven.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.700]   Satan rebels, a third of the angels are backing him up.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.700]   Archangel Michael fights against him, and he's able to overpower him,
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.700]   and as a result of that, Satan and his angels are fallen.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:14.700]   Now, Jesus is describing this scene, and he's not saying that he just saw this yesterday.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.700]   Jesus is describing this scene because he himself was there.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.700]   He saw this.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:25.700]   So he says, "We come back, and the angels, even they are subjected to us.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   When we declare your name, they knew he was from you."
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.700]   So not only did Jesus have authority over them,
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   he has authority to give them the authority.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.700]   And so Jesus is telling them, "I was there.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.700]   Not only was I there, I was the one who kicked them out of heaven.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.700]   And that's why when you go in my name,
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.700]   that you're able to have this authority and power."
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.700]   And then Jesus goes even further than that.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.700]   That not only do you have that, you have power to heal.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.700]   That no serpent or scorpion is going to harm you.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.700]   No enemy is going to be able to touch you.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.700]   I'm going to keep you safe.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.700]   Now, that promise wasn't just for anybody at any time.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:06.700]   He was saying that when I send you out to do my work,
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.700]   when I send you out as lambs among wolves,
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.700]   that everything that you need is going to come under my authority.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.700]   Remember, Jesus, before he left, he said to his apostles,
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.700]   "You're going to be dragged in front of governors and kings."
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.700]   And I know you're fishermen, and just like Moses,
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   he was so afraid of speaking in front of Pharaoh.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.700]   Jesus is telling them ahead of time to prepare them.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.700]   When you go before them, don't worry about what you're going to say.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.700]   I didn't call you because of your great ability to articulate truth.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.700]   When you go there, you go with my authority,
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.700]   and the Holy Spirit is going to teach you what to say.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.700]   So with my power, you go.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.700]   That's basically what Jesus was saying.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.700]   And he describes his whole ministry.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   Why Jesus did what he did with the 70 disciples.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.700]   In 1 Corinthians 2, 3-5, Paul says,
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.700]   "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.700]   and in my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom,
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.700]   but in demonstration of the Spirit's power,
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.700]   so that your faith would not rest on wisdom of men,
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.700]   but on the power of God."
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   Every time we look at Apostle Paul,
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.700]   sometimes we hear people interpret Paul's ministry and say,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.700]   "Yeah, he was chosen because he was a Roman citizen,
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.700]   so he would have had a much easier time getting around.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.700]   He was very well-educated, so he didn't need much training.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.700]   He already knew the Old Testament inside and out,
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.700]   so that's why he was chosen.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.700]   He was already wealthy and well-connected,
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.700]   so wherever he goes, he's able to get into certain places."
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.700]   But Paul says exactly the opposite.
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   He said, "I was chosen because I was the chief of sinners.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.700]   I was the worst person."
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.700]   In fact, that's exactly how people responded when Paul became a Christian.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.700]   How can we possibly trust that guy?
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.700]   And the whole reason why Paul says why he was chosen
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:03.700]   is to demonstrate not his power, not his love,
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.700]   not his grace, but God's power and grace.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.700]   If he can save somebody like me,
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.700]   if he can use somebody like me,
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.700]   obviously he can save you,
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.700]   to highlight his power.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.700]   Sometimes we see people interpret even King David.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.700]   He said he was chosen because he was in the background
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.700]   while his brothers were out playing soldier,
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.700]   and he was honing his skill on his sling.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.700]   And because he got so good at it and at the perfect time,
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.700]   God needed him and chose him to represent him and kill Goliath.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.700]   The Bible tells us exactly the opposite.
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.700]   A younger brother who wasn't prepared,
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.700]   and the reason why he was able to hit him right on the forehead
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:49.700]   wasn't because God was waiting for a master slingshotter to arise.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.700]   God was choosing somebody that other human beings
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.700]   would not have obviously chosen
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.700]   against the principles of this world
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:03.700]   to show them that their faith is not on man but on God.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.700]   Because our natural instinct is,
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.700]   if we organize, if we get the right people,
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.700]   if we throw right funding on it,
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.700]   so they don't come back from missions and say,
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.700]   "You know, we had such a great team.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.700]   "We had a great fisherman who knew how to catch fish,
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.700]   "so we never got hungry.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.700]   "We had somebody who was able to make shelter,
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.700]   "and so we never got cold.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.700]   "We had somebody who was a master auditor.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.700]   "Everything he says, he's able to give .1, .2, .3,
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.700]   "and when he speaks, people listen.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.700]   "So if we can just multiply this team wherever we go,
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.700]   "I think we can be successful."
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.700]   Jesus was doing exactly the opposite
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.700]   so that they don't come back and give credit to man
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.700]   so that they can understand that this power came from him,
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.700]   and that's exactly why they were rejoicing.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.700]   They come back and he says, "In your name."
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.700]   When they knew that we came from you,
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.700]   that even the demons couldn't do anything,
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.700]   but Jesus' response to them in verse 20,
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.700]   and for the rest of the time,
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.700]   we're going to be spending time in here.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.700]   "Nevertheless," he said,
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.700]   "that's great that you've experienced all of this.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.700]   "All of these things are great,
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.700]   "but nevertheless do not rejoice in this,
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.700]   "that the spirits are subject to you,
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.700]   "but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.700]   At first glance, it may look like
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.700]   Jesus is pouring cold water into their joy,
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.700]   and they come back and say, "Oh, it was so exciting.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.700]   "We saw people come to Christ, and demons are shattering.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.700]   "We were able to heal the sick."
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.700]   He said, "That's great, but don't rejoice over that."
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.700]   How can you not rejoice over that?
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.700]   Why does he have to correct them?
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.700]   If you're going to rejoice over anything,
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:48.700]   rejoice over not the gift, but the giver.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.700]   There's four things that I want to mention here.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.700]   Why this is so important,
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   why it's so fundamental to our faith,
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.700]   to rejoice over our names being written,
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.700]   our salvation, over anything else.
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.700]   Number one, all other gifts,
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:08.700]   everything that they've experienced is circumstantial.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.700]   Success in ministry is circumstantial.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.700]   That's why Paul was telling Timothy,
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.700]   "You keep preaching in season and out of season."
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.700]   You know why he's saying that?
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.700]   Because all his companions were beginning to leave.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.700]   They're going back home.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.700]   The initial excitement, right?
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.700]   It's like when you plant the church.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.700]   Initial excitement, we planted a church,
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.700]   and the honeymoon period is over,
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.700]   and now difficulty begins to come in.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.700]   By the time that Paul was writing 2 Timothy,
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.700]   some of the people who were faithful with him,
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.700]   even imprisoned with him, persecuted with him,
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.700]   were beginning to change their mind and go home.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.700]   He was telling Timothy,
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:49.700]   "You keep at this, in season and out of season."
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.700]   In fact, most of the prophets in the Old Testament
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.700]   preached out of season.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   Every single one of them, Hezekiah, Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.700]   every single one of them, God sent it to them
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.700]   because they weren't listening.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.700]   They didn't go there, and then revival broke out.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.700]   He just sent them to warn them.
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.700]   If you look at Paul and Peter and the apostles,
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.700]   yeah, they experienced persecution,
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:18.700]   but they planted churches.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.700]   The Word of God was coming to them.
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.700]   They were healing the sick, raising the dead.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.700]   So even though they were heavily persecuted, it was season.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.700]   Church was being planted.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.700]   A new covenant was coming in.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.700]   Majority of the people that I know
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:38.700]   who are laboring in ministry struggle with fruit,
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.700]   whether they're missionaries, whether they're pastors,
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.700]   whether they're small group leaders.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.700]   Anybody who is engaging in ministry
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.700]   knows the frustration of not bearing fruit.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.700]   You give so much effort and very little fruit.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.700]   See, if our joy comes from the fruit,
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.700]   it's seasonal.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   You'll experience some of it.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.700]   I mean, earlier part of--when we're going into China,
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.700]   it was just--fruit was just falling from the trees.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.700]   Five, six, seven years into it,
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.700]   more and more churches started coming in.
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.700]   Money started pouring into China.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.700]   And that same kind of fervor and interest,
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.700]   we could visually see disappearing.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.700]   Every time a Starbucks came in,
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.700]   there's less and less interest.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.700]   So even that, even this ministry out in China was seasonal.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:34.700]   If our joy is dependent upon the fruit that we see,
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.700]   it is circumstantial.
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:42.700]   And when it is not season, we don't know how to rejoice.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.700]   Secondly, all these gifts are temporary.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.700]   It was meant to be temporary.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   In 1 Corinthians 13, 8-10, it says,
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.700]   "Love never fails, but if there are gifts of prophecy,
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.700]   "they will be done away with.
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.700]   "If there are tongues, they will cease.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.700]   "If there are knowledge, it will be done away with,
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.700]   "for we know in part, prophesy in part,
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.700]   "but when the perfect comes,
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.700]   "the partial will be done away with."
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.700]   Pastor Mark did a great job expositing and focusing
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.700]   and helping us to see the context of this text
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:12.700]   because we often look at 1 Corinthians 13-10 and say,
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.700]   "Well, is the perfect the closing of the canon of the Bible,
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.700]   "or is it Jesus coming, or is it our perfection?"
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.700]   But the main point that he's trying to make in this
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.700]   is the context of this is
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.700]   that all the people in Corinth were divided
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.700]   because they're saying, "You know what?
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.700]   "The leader that I'm following is Paul,"
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.700]   or, "I'm following Apollos," or, "I'm following Peter,"
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.700]   and they were one-upping each other in ministry,
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.700]   that they had higher knowledge
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.700]   because they were following the right leader.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.700]   And so what Paul was trying to tell them,
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:49.700]   that you're one-upping each other on the lesser gift.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.700]   The greater gift is love.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.700]   All these things you see temporarily as a child.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.700]   Everything that you're experiencing is temporary,
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.700]   but what is eternal is love,
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.700]   and that's why he ends it by saying
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.700]   that of all these things, the greatest is love.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.700]   The greatest is love.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.700]   So these gifts that they come and they're experiencing,
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.700]   he says it's meant to be temporary.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.700]   It's supposed to be seasonal.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.700]   But here's the real reason.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.700]   The ultimate goal of these gifts
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.700]   is ultimately to bring us to Christ,
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.700]   to bring us to the giver.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.700]   1 Corinthians 13, 12-13 says,
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.700]   "For now we see in a mirror dimly,
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.700]   but then face to face."
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.700]   Everything that we're experiencing,
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.700]   we're only experiencing partially,
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   but then we will see him face to face.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.700]   "Now I know in part, but then I will know fully,
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.700]   just as I also have been fully known.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.700]   But now faith, hope, love abide these three,
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.700]   but the greatest of these is love."
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.700]   If you remember the seven "I am" statements of Jesus
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   in the book of John,
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.700]   every time he did something,
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.700]   or he was in a context,
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.700]   he ends it by saying, "I am."
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.700]   He would feed the 5,000, and people are elated
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.700]   that they were able to experience this,
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:14.700]   and he says, "You're looking for temporary bread,
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.700]   but I am the bread."
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.700]   He's in a context where he's a blind man
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.700]   who got kicked out of the synagogue,
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.700]   and you're so concerned about getting back into society,
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.700]   he says, "I am the door."
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.700]   You're so concerned about the opinions
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.700]   of the synagogue leaders,
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.700]   and the effect that it'll have on your life,
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.700]   he says, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.700]   You're so afraid that if I leave,
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.700]   that you're going to be abandoned,
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.700]   and you don't know what to do.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.700]   He says, "I am the vine."
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.700]   You're so concerned that if I leave,
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.700]   that somehow you're going to be persecuted,
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.700]   and you're going to die.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   He says, "I am the life."
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.700]   So all of the "I am" statements
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.700]   was to tell them all the gift,
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.700]   that everything that God has given you,
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.700]   everything that God has given the nation of Israel,
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:58.700]   was a gift to bring you to me.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.700]   So if your joy is contingent upon fruit,
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.700]   on your circumstance,
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:10.700]   then you've missed the whole point.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.700]   We are co-heirs of Christ.
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.700]   When the Bible says that our names
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.700]   are written in the book of life,
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.700]   if you're going to rejoice over anything,
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.700]   rejoice over the fact that your names
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:24.700]   are written in the book of life.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.700]   If you've been a Christian for any period of time,
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.700]   you hear that and say,
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.700]   "Well, that's Christianity 101.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.700]   "I learned that in membership class.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.700]   "I learned that in Sunday school.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.700]   "I learned that in VBS."
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.700]   For whatever the reason,
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.700]   we hear that justification, adoption,
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.700]   co-heirs with Christ,
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.700]   we have free access to the throne of God,
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.700]   and then we're like, "Okay, now what do we do?
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.700]   "Now we need to make disciples of the world.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.700]   "Now we need to do something for God.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:54.700]   "Now we need to have children.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.700]   "Now we need to get married.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.700]   "Now we need to do this and we need to do that."
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.700]   And then we say, "Okay, we have that.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.700]   "Okay, we already have that.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.700]   "Okay, so whenever we talk about that,
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.700]   "it's like, okay, okay, I already know that.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.700]   "Teach that to the new Christians.
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.700]   "I already know that.
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.700]   "But how do we make disciples?
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.700]   "How do we plant churches?
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:13.700]   "How do we multiply?
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.700]   "How do we bear fruit?"
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:20.700]   And so we get so fixated on what we need to do,
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:25.700]   and we lose the joy of what we already have.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:34.700]   The Scripture says that we have become co-heirs with Christ.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.700]   And you're looking at me with no face expression.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:45.700]   We have become co-heirs with Christ.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.700]   Nothing?
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.700]   Nothing?
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:56.700]   We have become co-heirs with the Son of God.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.700]   What does that mean?
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:05.700]   Everything that He has, we have.
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.700]   Nothing?
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.700]   Compare that to everything else.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:17.700]   Compare that with everything else.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:23.700]   Everything else seems trivial in light of that.
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.700]   We've become co-heirs with Christ.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.700]   He's our Abba Father.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.700]   He calls us His co-workers that when we die,
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.700]   we're going to be in heaven with Him for eternity.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:38.700]   Everything that He has given us is so that we can have that.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.700]   But for whatever the reason, at some point in our walk with God,
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.700]   that becomes a given.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.700]   And then now we've got to do all this.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.700]   And we're so fixated on the gift and what we're going to do.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:54.700]   And some of them, a lot of them, may be good things.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.700]   But if that kills your joy,
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.700]   if that somehow affects your worship before God,
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.700]   you've missed the whole point.
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.700]   If you ask a three-year-old, "Why do you love Mommy or Daddy?"
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:07.700]   They'll tell you.
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:08.700]   They're blunt.
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.700]   They don't care about your feelings.
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.700]   "We like better Mommy or Daddy."
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.700]   It's like, "Mommy, why?"
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.700]   "Because I wanted this toy and she gave it to me."
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.700]   "You didn't give it to me."
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.700]   They'll tell you to your face.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.700]   And the next day, Daddy comes and buys him ice cream.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:23.700]   He said, "Who do you love?"
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.700]   "Daddy."
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.700]   "Why?"
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.700]   "He took me to McDonald's yesterday."
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.700]   Now you ask that to a 20-year-old, and they say,
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:30.700]   "Why do you like Mommy and Daddy?"
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.700]   He says, "Oh, you know, I wanted this designer pants,
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.700]   and Mommy got it for me."
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.700]   "Daddy didn't give it to me."
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:37.700]   "Who do you like?"
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.700]   "I like Daddy better because I asked him to, you know,
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.700]   get this thing for my car, and he got it for me."
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.700]   You know, you hear that, you say,
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:48.700]   "Okay, you know, I have some more work to do."
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.700]   Then you get a 30-year-old, and you ask a 30-year-old,
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.700]   say, "Who do you love, Mommy or Daddy?"
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.700]   And they say, "Well, I like Daddy because, you know,
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.700]   he gave me some money.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.700]   He gave me a couple thousand dollars because I needed
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.700]   to do this and that."
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.700]   You hear from a 3-year-old, and you say, "Oh, you know,
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.700]   it's cute because you expect that from a 3-year-old."
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.700]   You hear from a 20-year-old say, "Oh, my gosh.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.700]   It's frustrating, but, you know, sometimes it's not
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.700]   a full-grown adult yet, maybe."
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:13.700]   You hear from a 30-year-old, it's like,
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.700]   "What is wrong with you?"
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.700]   The reason why you have any of that is because you have
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.700]   a mom and dad.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:24.700]   But at some point, you would think that you would mature
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.700]   beyond the gift, and the real gift that you have
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.700]   is you have a mother and father who loves you.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:35.700]   That's the real gift, not the things that you got.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.700]   The whole point of everything that Jesus was doing
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.700]   was to bring us to Him, to bring us to Him.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.700]   And that's why He says, "If you're going to rejoice
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:47.700]   over anything, rejoice that your name is written
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.700]   in the Book of Life, that I know you."
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:55.700]   You know what's the irony of all of this?
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:00.700]   We don't know a single name of these 70 disciples.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:04.700]   I'll bet you there were celebrities in the early church
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.700]   because, aside from the 12, these are the 70 ones
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.700]   who went and saw that experience.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.700]   They cast out demons, they healed the sick.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:14.700]   They were the first ones that experienced that.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.700]   I'll bet you that when the Pentecost came,
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:20.700]   that these 70 people were among the 120.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.700]   And I'll bet you, we don't know a single name,
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.700]   but I'll bet you the early church knew all 70 of them,
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:26.700]   who they were.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.700]   That they were the ones who received the Holy Spirit.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.700]   They were the first disciples that went out,
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.700]   and as they were running for their life,
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.700]   planted the church in Antioch.
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:37.700]   They planted the church in Galatia.
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.700]   These were the guys.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.700]   Remember, everywhere Paul went, before Paul even went there,
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.700]   he went to a synagogue, there were Christians there already.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.700]   Well, who took it?
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.700]   These guys.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:52.700]   These guys were first trained,
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.700]   and I'll bet you they all knew his name,
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:57.700]   but today, not a single one.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.700]   Not a single one.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.700]   If our joy is based upon circumstance
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:06.700]   and reputation of other people, it is temporary.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.700]   All of it was meant to bring us to the real gift,
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.700]   which is Christ.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:17.700]   How many of you know your grandparents' names?
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   I know somebody's going to come up, "I know."
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.700]   Yeah, I know, there's a few of you.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:25.700]   How many of you know your great-grandparents' names?
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.700]   How many of you know when they passed away,
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.700]   what their job was?
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.700]   From my experience, because I've asked,
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.700]   many of you don't even know your parents' middle name.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.700]   I ask you how old your parents are,
[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:44.700]   somebody between 50 and 60, I'm not sure, right?
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.700]   You don't even know their age,
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.700]   so I'm not even going to ask about the grandparents,
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.700]   like great-grandparents.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.700]   Even within our own family,
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.700]   they're not going to remember us
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.700]   after a few generations, at most.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.700]   So when Jesus says, if you're going to rejoice
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.700]   over these gifts, these temporary things,
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:06.700]   sooner or later, you're going to become depressed.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:07.700]   It's going to come.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.700]   If your joy comes and goes, why is this so important?
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.700]   Why is it that 1 John 3, 1, it says,
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.700]   "See how great a love, behold our greater love,
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.700]   the Father's bestowed on us,"
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:21.700]   that we would be called the children of God.
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.700]   That truth, "Behold the mystery of the gospel,"
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.700]   is not just for the beginning.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.700]   It's not just when we're justified.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:36.700]   Every part of our life, that's the fuel that drives us.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:37.700]   Why is this so important?
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.700]   Because it affects our worship.
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.700]   If our worship is dependent upon bearing fruit
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:44.700]   or something good or somebody remembered me
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.700]   or I got a good job,
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.700]   then the next time that doesn't happen,
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.700]   you're not going to be able to worship God.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.700]   When you got sick or just like
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:54.700]   what everybody else is looking for,
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:59.700]   your worship is circumstantial.
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:01.700]   But he says to rejoice always,
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:04.700]   to give thanks in all circumstances.
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.700]   Why focusing and rejoicing over our salvation,
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.700]   that are names written in the book of life,
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.700]   it affects the way we worship.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.700]   Worship is something that happens
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.700]   because we're filled with gratitude
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.700]   for what we already have.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:19.700]   That's the catalyst.
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:23.700]   That's the foundation upon how or why we worship God.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:25.700]   It affects our witness.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.700]   He didn't just train us with a set of facts
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.700]   to regurgitate that and do a good job
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.700]   presenting it to the people who don't know.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.700]   No, we are witnesses of the new life in me.
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.700]   He wanted us to share our testimony
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:40.700]   of what God has done.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.700]   And that's why the scripture says in Romans
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.700]   that the gospel comes from faith to faith.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:50.700]   He uses us and so he wants a vessel
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:54.700]   as a testimony of the new life in Christ.
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.700]   So if we're out there just to be successful,
[00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:58.700]   you know, we're going to do our job.
[00:59:58.700 --> 00:59:59.700]   We're going to do a great job.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.700]   We're going to be so determined.
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.700]   We're going to be more determined than anybody else.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:06.700]   You're not representing the life of Christ.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.700]   Rejoice.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.700]   It affects the way we fellowship.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.700]   Fellowship isn't something because we found people
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.700]   who are similar age
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.700]   or because we speak the same language
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.700]   or same economic status.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:20.700]   That's not where true fellowship happens.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.700]   Our unity is because we have the same Father.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.700]   That we rejoice over the same God.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.700]   What makes you happy makes me happy.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.700]   What you worship, I worship.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.700]   So if our joy comes from circumstantial things
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.700]   that is meant to be temporary,
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.700]   ultimately given to us to bring us to God,
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.700]   then our fellowship gets affected,
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.700]   our spiritual growth.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.700]   Why do you want to continue to grow?
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.700]   You already have salvation.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.700]   Spiritual growth happens because we tasted
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.700]   the goodness of God and we want more of it.
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.700]   We have the glory of God,
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.700]   but we want more of it.
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.700]   We understand the love of God,
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.700]   but we understand we want more of it.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.700]   That's what causes sanctification.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.700]   That's the motivation.
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.700]   Not simply because we need to do good things for God.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.700]   Ultimately, it is an attitude of gratitude.
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.700]   Somebody who understands that the greatest gift
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.700]   that I could possibly imagine and dream of
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.700]   I already have in Christ.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.700]   It affects worship.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.700]   It affects our witness.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.700]   It affects our fellowship.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.700]   It affects our spiritual growth.
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:34.700]   And ultimately, it affects our perseverance.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.700]   Persevere because I already have everything that I need.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.700]   I'm going toward the natural end product
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.700]   of what God has given me.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.700]   So along the way, if I have fruit, great.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.700]   If I can make disciples, if I can do this and that, great.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.700]   If I can memorize scripture
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.700]   and I can exposit the scripture well, great.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:58.700]   But if the focus becomes the gift and not the giver,
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:02.700]   you have missed the whole point of all the gifts.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:03.700]   Let me conclude with this
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.700]   as we open up the communion table.
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.700]   In Ephesians 3, 14 and 19,
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:14.700]   Paul spends three chapters going deep into the gospel
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.700]   about redemption, about adoption,
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.700]   about predestination, about election,
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.700]   and he exposit it.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.700]   So if you want to know about salvation in detail,
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.700]   Ephesians 1-3 is where you ought to go.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.700]   There's many other passages,
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.700]   but that's one of the passages I would recommend you.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.700]   But this is how he concludes.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:36.700]   Before he says, "Therefore, that you ought to do this and this,"
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   before he does that,
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.700]   he concludes everything he says, and he says this.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.700]   "For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father,
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.700]   "from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.700]   "that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.700]   "to be strengthened with power through the Spirit in the inner man."
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   In other words, to be sanctified.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.700]   "That everything that I have taught you
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.700]   "would strengthen you with power,
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.700]   "so that everything that I've given you,
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.700]   "everything that you've experienced,
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.700]   "there's a purpose for that.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:06.700]   "So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith,
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.700]   "and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.700]   "may be able to comprehend with all the saints,
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.700]   "with all the breath and length and height and depth,
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.700]   "to know the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge,
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:21.700]   "that you may be filled up to the fullness of God."
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:24.700]   The whole purpose of your salvation
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.700]   is to bring you to Christ.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.700]   The whole purpose of your sanctification
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.700]   is so that you may understand the depth and the height
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.700]   and the width and the length of the love of Christ,
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.700]   together with other saints,
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.700]   so that we may have all of Christ and more of Christ.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.700]   That's how he concludes the Gospel.
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.700]   And once you have that,
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:48.700]   "Therefore, now live up to the calling that you've given."
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.700]   We're not trying to live to that.
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.700]   He said, "Live up to that,
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.700]   "the gift that you have already been given."
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:59.700]   Only those who have learned to rejoice
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.700]   over what they already have
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:06.700]   can truly be sanctified in Christ.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.700]   I'm gonna ask the praise team to come up
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.700]   as we prepare for worship.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.700]   And typically, we sing a communion song,
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.700]   but I wanna introduce--
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:18.700]   it's not introduce 'cause it's from the 1980s.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.700]   I forgot where this is from.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:24.700]   You know, usually they ask me, like, Tuesday or Wednesday,
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.700]   say, "Hey, based on sermon, do you have a song
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.700]   "that you wanna sing that's gonna kind of correlate
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.700]   "with what you're preaching?"
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.700]   And every once in a while, I'll have a song.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.700]   Majority of the time, I don't, you know,
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.700]   because I only know about six songs by memory.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.700]   But this one was perfect.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.700]   So I wanna introduce this song to you.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.700]   We're gonna sing this, and then we're gonna--
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.700]   we're gonna open up the communion table.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.700]   And I wanna tell you ahead of time, you know,
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.700]   we come here to celebrate, not by your effort, right?
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.700]   It's not because you've been good this week.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.700]   We come here because we need Christ
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.700]   to remember what he has done for us.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.700]   And so we wanna come in a worthy manner,
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.700]   but at the same time, the foundation
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.700]   upon this communion table is to remind us
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.700]   that your names are written in the book of life
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.700]   to rejoice and to celebrate.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.700]   So I ask, if you have not been baptized
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.700]   and there was no union with Christ
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.700]   because you've never repented of your sins,
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.700]   we ask that you would stay in your seat.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.700]   And for the rest of you, when you are ready,
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.700]   when we open up the communion table, to come one by one.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.700]   And this is the song that we're gonna sing.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.700]   "I have a maker. He formed my heart.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.700]   "Before even time began, my life was in his hands.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.700]   "He knows my name. He knows my every thought.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:35.700]   "He sees each tear that falls.
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.700]   "And he hears me when I call.
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.700]   "I have a father. He calls me his own.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.700]   "He'll never leave me, no matter where I go.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.700]   "He knows my name. He knows my name."
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.700]   Let's all sing this together.
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:11.700]   # I have a maker
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:17.700]   # He formed my heart
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:26.700]   # Before even time began
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:31.700]   # My life was in his hands
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:39.700]   # I have a maker
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:45.700]   # He formed my heart
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:54.700]   # Before even time began
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:59.700]   # My life was in his hands
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:07.700]   # He knows my name
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:15.700]   # He knows my every thought
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:22.700]   # He sees each tear that falls
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:27.700]   # And he hears me when I call
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:32.700]   # I have a maker
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:42.700]   # I have a father
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:50.700]   # He calls me his own
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:08:00.700]   # He'll never leave me, no matter where I go
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:10.700]   # He knows my name
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:17.700]   # He knows my every thought
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   # He sees each tear that falls
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:29.700]   # And he hears me when I call
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:38.700]   # He knows my name
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   # He knows my every thought
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:52.700]   # He sees each tear that falls
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:57.700]   # And he hears me when I call
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:05.700]   # And he hears me when I call
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:12.700]   # He hears me when I call. #
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.700]   Corinthians 11, 23, it says,
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:20.700]   "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you,
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.700]   "that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he portrayed took bread.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.700]   "When he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.700]   "'This is my body, which is for you.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.700]   "'Do this in remembrance of me.'
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.700]   "In the same way, he took the cup also after supper, saying,
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.700]   "'This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.700]   "'Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.700]   "'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.700]   "'you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'"
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:48.700]   Father, as we participate, Lord God, in this Lord's Supper,
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.700]   as you commanded your disciples to do this in remembrance of you,
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.700]   help us, Lord God, to think deeply of what you have given,
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.700]   that our rejoicing may be renewed,
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.700]   that our love and our worship may be truly in response
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.700]   to the great mercy that you've given us.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.700]   May Christ's name be glorified.
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.700]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   So we invite you one by one when you are ready to come,
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.700]   and if you're coming down the middle, make sure that you make two lines
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.700]   and then you exit to the sides when you come.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.700]   So we invite you when you are ready to come.
