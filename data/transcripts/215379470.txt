[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   All right, let me pray for us and then we'll start today.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.880]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the opportunity for us to gather together and study your Word.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.040]   We pray, Father, that you'd continue to guide us, lead us, illuminate our thoughts, that
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.080]   as we dig into this book, Lord God, that remains a mystery to so many of us.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.860]   We pray, Father, that you would help us to see the larger theme of your victory and your
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.120]   promises, Lord God, that all of them are absolutely certain.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   I pray that you would give us a greater sense of confidence, Lord, in our walk with you,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600]   greater sense of hope for the end.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.440]   Even the things that we don't understand, I pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.480]   would clearly guide and lead us, Lord God, that we may be able to glean what you desire
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.480]   of us.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.280]   So, we pray for grace.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.960]   We pray, Lord God, that the next few months as we commit our time to you in this letter,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.640]   give us guidance.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.680]   Speak to us, Lord God, that we may grow and mature in you.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.320]   All right, so the theme of the letter, I put certainty of the victory in Christ.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.880]   So obviously we are going to go into the book of Revelation and go into the details of the
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.800]   meanings behind the different prophecies and different visions, and we're going to try
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.480]   to dive into that.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.640]   But if you dive into it, then you missed a bigger picture.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.620]   The bigger picture of the book of Revelation, the theme is absolute certainty in the victory
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.040]   of Christ.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.400]   So what we are studying in the book of Revelation is not, hopefully this is going to happen.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   Every single part of what we're going to be studying has already been laid out, and so
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.960]   we're waiting for it to be fulfilled.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.000]   So the larger theme behind the book of Revelation is to give us absolute certainty in victory
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   in Christ.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.760]   So we're going to be, that's the larger picture and that's the theme that we're going to be
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   covering over.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.760]   So everything that we're studying, even if I don't mention it, just don't forget that
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.400]   that's the ultimate reason.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.200]   Just to give you the introduction, the word revelation, where we get the title of the
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.720]   book, in Greek apokalipsis, where we get the word apokalipsis, and don't confuse that with
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   apocrypha.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.240]   Apocrypha basically means extra writing.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.600]   It's not the Bible.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.520]   There's other writings that were written that's not part of the canon.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.080]   It's not apocrypha, but apocalyptic, meaning an uncovering or unveiling.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.280]   It's a book designed to uncover and unveil, not to conceal.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.600]   And so sometimes when we study the book of Revelation, because it's difficult and there's
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.320]   a lot of things that we don't clearly understand, that you come and think, "Oh, God deliberately
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.760]   made it difficult.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.080]   He deliberately sealed it so that we wouldn't know."
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.840]   That's not the point of the book of Revelation.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.640]   Just because we don't understand it doesn't mean that God deliberately hid it from us,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.160]   like He doesn't really want us to know.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.400]   There's a reason why He puts it in this form, and hopefully as we're studying through it,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.120]   we'll be able to glean some of that.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.440]   The author of the book, again, today is an introduction study, the author of the book
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.440]   of Revelation is Apostle John.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.560]   If you ever read the introduction of any commentary, they'll always tell you that there's always
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.720]   somebody questioning or debating.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.700]   But as far as the book of Revelation, his name is mentioned four separate times.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.480]   The early church fathers, there was absolutely no question about it.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.360]   Universally, they accepted that this was Apostle John, the one of the 12 disciples, the one
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.080]   of the sons of thunder, his brother is James.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:02.240]   You may have heard of this, but according to the early church history, that Apostle
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.000]   John was exiled to the island of Patmos for preaching the gospel in Asia.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.640]   And some say that the Romans dropped him into a vat of boiling oil, and then expecting him
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   to die.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   So they actually attempted to kill him, and then he ended up not dying and coming out.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.200]   And obviously, you can imagine the excruciating pain that he was in.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.480]   And the only reason why they didn't try it again is because of their superstition.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.080]   They thought that if you try to attempt to kill somebody and they don't die, it may be
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.980]   because God has some special favor on that individual.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.040]   So they were afraid to attempt to kill him again, so they ended up banishing him at the
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.400]   island of Patmos, which was considered a complete desert.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.780]   So while he was there, he has a vision from God, and he begins to write the revelation.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.840]   So whenever we talk about all the disciples being martyred except for one, if you really
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.440]   consider what Apostle John had to go through, it might have been easier for him just to
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.440]   die.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.020]   You can imagine going into boiling oil, coming out and surviving that, and how miserable
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.140]   the rest of his life was.
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.900]   So you can imagine the man who wrote the book of Revelation was physically in tremendous
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.580]   pain, physically in tremendous pain, and he sees this vision of Christ.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.940]   So in my mind, a man who is suffering like the way he's suffering, obviously he sees
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.620]   the vision, but can you imagine what this does for John?
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.860]   My guess is it would be a source of tremendous encouragement to John that he probably wanted
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.400]   to die.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.380]   He probably wanted to finish his life, and then when he sees this vision, he sees what's
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.380]   coming.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.020]   He doesn't know exactly when, but God, through what he sees, probably was a source of tremendous
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.020]   comfort to him.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.620]   So I can see that obviously everything written in the book of Revelation, it was meant for
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.320]   all of us, but specifically for John, I can imagine it would be a source of tremendous
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.740]   encouragement to him and relief for him.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.300]   Date of his writing, again, you'll see that some people will argue that this was written
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:16.020]   earlier, maybe 60, 65 AD during Nero's persecution, and then some will say even later on, right?
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:23.940]   But again, most scholars today believe that it was written anywhere between 90 to 102
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.740]   AD, so somewhere around 95 AD.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.420]   The significance behind that is that it helps us to identify the historical background behind
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.380]   some of the prophecies mentioned in this letter.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.460]   Part of the reason why some people will date it 65 AD is because that's about the time
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.660]   when Nero was in power.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.340]   So they're kind of going back and looking at some of the prophecies that he's saying
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.940]   and saying, "Well, this looks a lot like the intense persecution that Nero started,
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.740]   so therefore this must have been written during that period," and that's why they date it
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.260]   65.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:04.180]   But outside of preemptively setting a date behind the prophecies, most early church fathers
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.740]   also believe that this was written around that time.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.780]   Again, there was intense persecution also at 95 by a name of Dionysus.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.380]   He was the emperor at that time in 95, and it wasn't like there wasn't persecution, but
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.320]   it wasn't the one under Nero.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.600]   And so why the dating of it is important for this particular thing is while we're studying
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.920]   it, we're going to see some historical background and what it may be relating to what was going
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.240]   on at that particular time.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.600]   So again, we're looking at 95 AD as the writing of this letter.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   Why is the study of Revelation important?
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.200]   We are told that the second coming of Jesus would be like a thief coming at night.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.160]   Jesus talks about it, Paul talks about it in several of his letters, that it's going
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.740]   to be coming like a thief at night.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:02.000]   So when you hear the imagery of thief coming at night, is that a welcome scene?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.720]   Obviously not, meaning that it's going to be unwelcome, it's going to be sudden, and
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.600]   it's going to be negative, and that's how the world is going to receive the coming of
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.720]   Christ.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.560]   But then we're warned as Christians or exhorted that we would not be caught off guard to stay
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.240]   alert and to watch.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:30.320]   So the book of Revelation is a book that helps us to watch carefully.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.440]   So if you read, I'm just going to try this.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.400]   Did it work?
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.600]   Okay, all right.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.640]   First Thessalonians 5, 2-5.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:48.880]   It says, "For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.720]   thief in the night, which we are warned."
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:58.700]   While the people are saying there is peace and security, then suddenly, sudden destruction
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.800]   is going to come.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.680]   As labor pains comes upon a pregnant woman and they will not escape, but you are not
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.400]   to be in darkness so that the day does not surprise you.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.320]   So if you look at some of the things that we are exhorted in First Thessalonians 5,
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.640]   2-5, the day of the Lord, oftentimes could be referring to the whole end period from
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.760]   the time of Christ until his second coming, but specifically here, if you understand the
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.420]   context of First Thessalonians, he's talking about the revelation of the man of lawlessness
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.080]   as the end times.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.180]   So this is, he's talking about a period that the book of Revelation is most likely
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.780]   talking about, that it's going to come like a thief in the night, it's going to be very
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.520]   sudden and negative to the world, and it's going to come during a time when people are
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.920]   not going to be expecting it.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.360]   That people are not, are just enjoying their life, peace and safety, and when that comes,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:01.080]   it's going to come suddenly, and he says, "But you, to not to be in darkness."
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:08.240]   Remember when Jesus rebuked the Jews, he said, "How are you able to tell the seasons, when
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.480]   it's going to rain and when it's not going to rain, you know when the harvest is coming
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.280]   and not coming, but how do you not know the time of the Son of Man coming?"
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.840]   In other words, it was prophesied in the Old Testament, and they were completely oblivious,
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840]   right?
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.080]   So what Paul is saying, or what God is saying in First Thessalonians, that that would not
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.000]   happen to us in his second coming.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   So in the first coming, the Jews completely missed it because they weren't paying attention,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   right?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.560]   You're looking for, you're looking to the scriptures, thinking that you have life in
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.480]   them, but all the scripture really points to me, was preparing for me to come, and then
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.600]   when I came, you completely missed it because you didn't pay attention.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.220]   So what Paul is saying, do not be like that, right?
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.780]   Do not be in darkness, and don't be caught up with the rest of the world looking for
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.560]   peace and safety, and all of a sudden when Jesus comes, like, "Oh my gosh, he's coming,"
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560]   right?
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.920]   So part of why we need to study the book of Revelation is that Revelation is a letter
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.560]   that's given to us so that we wouldn't be caught off guard, right?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.920]   We may study it, and at the end you say, "Well, I don't know a clear picture.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.200]   It doesn't tell me exactly the right date."
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.640]   Like, some people study the book of Revelation to look for, "Well, Jesus is going to come
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.840]   in the year 2025, February 18th," and they do all these weird calculations, right?
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.720]   Now, scripture doesn't do that.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.360]   In fact, actually, it's very dangerous that we do that, but it's equally dangerous not
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.280]   to be paying attention, right?
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.960]   It's equally dangerous so when we see the signs of the end times coming, and you're
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.880]   just completely oblivious, you know?
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.320]   And you're just kind of like, "We're going to make business, we're going to make money,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.480]   we're only thinking about the next 10 years or the 20 years and not really eagerly waiting.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.160]   What are some of the signs that he gave us that we ought to be looking for?"
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:07.720]   So the study of the book of Revelation is important for that reason.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.640]   The next verse in Revelation 16, 15, "Behold, I am coming like a thief, but blessed is the
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.920]   one who stays awake," right?
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:25.360]   "Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on," meaning he's ready for
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.360]   action.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   He's not at home relaxed in his sweatpants.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.600]   He's ready for action.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.960]   "That they may not go about naked and be exposed."
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.120]   In other words, he's warning, saying that we should be ready.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.560]   We should always be watching and ready.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.480]   And I think in God's wisdom, he left it like that on purpose.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.640]   Just like in the Old Testament when all these prophecies, when we look in retrospect, it
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.320]   was clear.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.080]   There's all kinds of prophetic utterances that Jesus was going to come when we look
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.840]   back at it.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.760]   But then the Jews, because they weren't paying attention, they weren't looking to see and
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.920]   understand the prophecies.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.560]   Instead, they were so consumed with their daily well-being that they weren't paying
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.520]   attention to this.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   So the warning that, again, in Revelation 16, 15, that we do not get caught off guard,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.360]   but be ready, that we would live.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.720]   And in his wisdom, he doesn't pinpoint a day.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.200]   Because if he pinpoints a day, I think our human response would be, if he's not going
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.380]   to come for the next 30 years, that means we've got 30 years to do whatever we want.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.000]   He left it so that he could have come.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.520]   He could have come in the first century.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.400]   He could have come in 500 AD.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.360]   He could come tomorrow.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.200]   Or he could come a thousand years later.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.320]   But he left it like that on purpose so that every generation of Christian would live eagerly
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.560]   waiting.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.080]   But no matter how eagerly you wait, nobody waits more than 100 years.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.960]   Even if you're a Christian all your life, nobody waits more than 100 years.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:06.520]   But during that period that we wait, he wants us to live as if he can come in our lifetime.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:13.680]   And I think in God's wisdom, he did that on purpose.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.120]   This book was written to cause God's people to live lives eagerly watching and waiting
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.080]   for his coming.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.400]   And so hopefully as we're studying through the book of Revelation, that that's what would
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:33.040]   incite us as a church to have our paradigm of our future not to be short-sighted.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.200]   If I work hard and sacrifice that maybe next year I'm going to get this, or if I invest
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.160]   properly, maybe our property value is going to go up in the next five years, that we would
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:50.520]   not live short-sighted, that we would be able to live with eternity in mind.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   Revelation provides a church with the clearest vision of the conclusion of the end, end times,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.600]   of the work that Jesus initiated on the cross and how it will affect the church and the
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.680]   world.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:07.280]   So all that we know about the New Testament is about the effects of Jesus' work.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:14.280]   The whole book of Revelation is about the end, the end conclusion of the church, of
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.680]   evangelism, of discipleship.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.080]   Everything that we're doing, everything that God initiated, the theology of here, not yet,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.160]   is going to be concluded in the book of Revelation.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.560]   So Revelation is the clearest vision of what God intended, what Christ intended when he
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.360]   was crucified on the cross and where he is taking us.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.480]   So it's kind of like seeing the end point of the journey that we're on, and that's the
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.200]   book of Revelation.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.280]   Now what makes the study of the book of Revelation difficult, as you probably already know?
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.880]   How many of you, I actually asked this in one of the discussion questions, how many
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:58.640]   of you have actually studied systematically through the book of Revelation before?
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.920]   Okay, so a few of you, four or five of you.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.480]   Now when you studied it, did you study by yourself or was it taught in a Bible study?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:13.880]   Okay, well actually that wouldn't answer your question, right?
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.200]   How many of you actually sat in a teaching or a Bible study where somebody else was teaching
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   that?
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Okay, all right.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.880]   And let me ask a few more specific.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.720]   How many of you studied under a dispensational teaching?
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.320]   Okay, so some of you guys may not know what I'm talking about.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.480]   How many of you studied that under a covenant teaching?
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.320]   Okay, you took two classes or something?
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.920]   Okay, okay.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.680]   But it was under a directive of somebody who believed in dispensationalism, right?
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.600]   Okay, yeah, that's what I meant.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.320]   All right, the reason why I asked that is depending on your theological perspective,
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.300]   how you interpret the book of Revelation is going to sound very, very different.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.880]   And I'm going to go over that.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.320]   And I'm going to kind of give you a preview of our philosophy of approach to the book
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.600]   of Revelation so that you guys have some idea.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.080]   Most of you are probably thinking, well, dispensationalism, covenant, like what's the difference and why
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.160]   does it affect the way we study it?
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.720]   Okay, there's four main approaches to the interpretation of the book of Revelation.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.680]   The first one is called the Preterist, the contemporary historical approach.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.280]   Do I have that?
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.160]   The contemporary historical approach.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.200]   Do you have that on your sheet or did I erase it?
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   You have it there?
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   Okay.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.600]   All right, so Preterist is a contemporary historical approach.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.040]   This approach attempts to apply the book to the actual events of the first century historical
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:50.960]   setting, meaning that the people who approach it this way basically look for every part
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:57.320]   of the revelation here all the way from chapter 1 to chapter 22 that he's referring to something
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.640]   that was happening that he's actually seeing.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.840]   And so it has nothing to do with the future.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.240]   It's just something that's happening in the past.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:13.320]   So all of this stuff is allegorically or symbolically represents something historical.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.960]   So they're going to be looking for, if they believe in that the Antichrist is Nero, they're
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.240]   going to look around all the other stuff.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.280]   Who was his helpers?
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.160]   Maybe that's who the beast is and that's how they do the interpretation.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.520]   So that's called the Preterist view.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.960]   Their primary interpretation will look for current events at the time that John was writing
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:43.560]   it and these are the people who will probably give the dating to 65 AD because there was
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:49.880]   a lot of stuff going on at that time they think looks a little bit more similar.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.360]   That's the Preterist view.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.300]   The second view is called the historical view or historicist approach.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.040]   In comparison to the Preterist which placed a book entirely within the first century,
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.240]   the historicist interpret as a forecast of the course of history.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.440]   In other words, they're also looking for historical pointers but they don't limit it to the first
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.040]   century, they don't limit it to the time that John was writing it.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:20.000]   In fact, most of their interpretation is looking forward and they're looking for certain historical
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.440]   things that will take place, have taken place and will take place.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:32.280]   So these people will interpret saying that the Pope may have been the Antichrist.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:39.320]   Now who would think that the Pope was the Antichrist in history?
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.400]   The reformers, right?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.680]   The reformers.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.920]   The reformers because they were battling at that time their biggest enemy was the Catholic
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.240]   Church.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.760]   And so during the period of the Reformation a lot of the reformers, John Calvin and Martin
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:00.560]   Luther, all of these guys, they kind of adhere to this interpretation because they interpreted
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.880]   the evil kingdom as the Catholic Church and the Pope as the Antichrist, right?
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.480]   He's a religious figure and so if you go to a Presbyterian, and this is, those of you
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.880]   who study the book of Revelation under the covenant theological bent, this is the primary
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.960]   approach that you probably saw or heard, right?
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:29.440]   They'll interpret the Reformation as a, again, as certain things that are mentioned in the
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.000]   Revelation chapter 20 and so they're the historicists.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.080]   And this is, again, primarily if you go to a Presbyterian church that this is the view
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.000]   that they're going to be telling you.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.440]   You have the futurist approach.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.320]   The futurist approach regards everything from Revelation 4-1.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:57.200]   So what's in Revelations 1-3?
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.400]   The seven churches, right?
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.480]   So seven churches obviously are historical.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.840]   There's specific churches that he's mentioning, but starting from chapter 4 and on, it is
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.920]   all referring to the end times, right?
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   And when you say end times, we're not talking about years removed from them.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.840]   We're talking about the very end, the second coming of Christ, the tribulation, the rapture,
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:23.120]   the Armageddon, the white throne, judgment seat of Christ, the millennium, all of that,
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.100]   that all of this is referring to that period of time.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.780]   The group that holds to this view, this teaching, are the dispensationalists.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:38.540]   So if you've ever gone and sat through teaching, in fact, a lot of times when there's heavy
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:44.840]   emphasis on the teaching of the end times, it's usually coming from this camp.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.220]   And this is the camp that's looking for the dates and looking for specific pointers and,
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:54.820]   you know, Russia is the Antichrist or Kim Jong-un is the Antichrist or, you know, and
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.400]   I've heard people say Reagan was the Antichrist when he was Reagan.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.360]   I mean, he was the president of the United States.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.160]   But these guys are always looking for certain things that they think are going to trigger
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.140]   the tribulation.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.660]   And this is the traditional dispensational view.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.560]   Now within each one of these views, there are variations, but this is just kind of a
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.880]   broad stroke, right?
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.380]   So even dispensationalists, they have progressive dispensationalists that whose, their view
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.480]   is a bit different than this.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.100]   But this is just broadly.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:30.860]   So you can see if you think that all of Revelation is written for, written about a historical
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.640]   thing in the first century, you can see how that's going to affect the way you interpret
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.700]   the book of Revelation, right?
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.460]   If you're studying the book of Revelation just to look for, you know, the seven churches
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:46.820]   represent the seven different eras of church history before he comes, whether it's a thousand
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.920]   years, two thousand years, three thousand years, you're always going to be looking at
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.200]   history and saying, "Oh, maybe Hitler was the Antichrist."
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.720]   You know, "Oh, this must be referring to Hitler," or "This must be referring to Mussolini,"
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.760]   right?
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.360]   You see how that would affect the way you interpret, right, the book of Revelation?
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.160]   And if you think everything's on the end time, you're going to be looking for triggers.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.640]   There's going to be, you know, wars and rumors of war, so you're always looking for what's,
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   is it tribulation?
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   Is it going to come now?
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.640]   Is it going to come now?
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:23.880]   So, how many of you have, I'm guessing you didn't, left behind the movie?
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.440]   Maybe some of you guys were kids and your youth pastor made you watch it, right?
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.160]   That was the whole thing about, you know, the tribulation and the church going through
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:38.680]   the tribulation, and again, that would fall under this category, the futurist view.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:44.160]   The idealist view, they just discard all of it.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.920]   Their approach is that the Revelation is not to be taken literally, not to be taken in
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.160]   reference to any specific event.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:58.720]   Everything is interpreted ideologically or allegorically, meaning it has nothing to do
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.480]   with history.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.960]   These are just Christian principles that are taught.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.000]   Jesus reigns, well, how does the book of Revelation teach he reigns?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.880]   Well, he comes on a cloud, right?
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.040]   He has thunder in his mouth, and all of this symbolizes the attributes of God.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:21.200]   So it has nothing to do with his coming, it's just revelation of God's attributes, right?
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.620]   And the different seals and all of these things are pointers of biblical principles that we
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.840]   are to glean from, and so they allegorize pretty much everything, right?
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.360]   They don't look for any historical connection to the book of Revelation.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.660]   These are called, these people are called idealists.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:45.080]   As I said, these are four very broad pointers, like this is typically, if you are any one
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.320]   of these, you're going to have a certain bent toward the book of Revelation, right?
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   Take a guess.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.480]   We are Baptists, right?
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.760]   And those of you who've been at our church for a while, like what is, I'm talking about
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.760]   our bent.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:07.240]   I don't think any one of these completely represents us, but what would be our bent?
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:12.440]   You're afraid to say?
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   Probably, right?
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:21.040]   We probably lean more toward the futurist, but I was taught at a dispensational school.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:28.120]   I actually took a class on the book of Revelation with a heavy dispensational view.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:36.360]   I was taught the pre-trib, pre-millennial, pre-rapture, you know, I was taught the very
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.440]   traditional view of the dispensational view of the end times.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.000]   They actually have a chart and they go through, and then so if you go to a very heavy dispensational
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.760]   church, they'll actually have a chart on the wall.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.000]   Like we have, I don't know what we have, we have whatever, we have our church vision,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   right?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.120]   We have a four-fold church vision hanging on the wall because it's important to us,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120]   right?
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.600]   So if you go to a very traditional dispensational view, they'll actually have a chart of the
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.360]   end times about when Jesus is going to come, when he's going to go up, what happens when
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.800]   they go up, how long they're going to stay there when he comes down, what is the Armageddon,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.040]   and they'll interpret all of that.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.840]   Now that's how I learned it, okay?
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.240]   After I came out, I was thoroughly confused, right?
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.400]   One, because I didn't realize Jesus was going to come back that many times.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.200]   You know, I thought, my dad was a Presbyterian, I grew up in a, even though I didn't pay attention,
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.880]   I wasn't a Christian, I never heard of this before, right?
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.020]   I've never heard of tribulation and Armageddon, I've never heard of these things before.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.800]   So when I was taught this at school, it seemed so foreign.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.880]   But you know, who am I to question?
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.960]   I don't know the Bible like these people do.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:50.360]   So I came out and I wrestled, I studied through it, did the book of Revelation and doing quiet
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:58.200]   time, taught certain passages, and I came out and say, you know, I thought that at least
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.880]   at this point, like everything would be clear, and it's still not clear to me, right?
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.960]   There are certain things, there was a point in my wrestling with all of this where I was
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:15.000]   very interested in converting to covenant theology.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.840]   Now most of you guys could care less.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.760]   I think a few of you may be interested.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.000]   I almost went to that point until I realized I don't agree with the way they interpreted
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.920]   the Old Testament, right?
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:34.960]   The Old Testament prophecies were fulfilled literally, majority of it.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.040]   But they'll take a few examples of an allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament, they'll
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.720]   apply to everything in the Old Testament, and I realize that that's not what I believed.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:49.000]   Now the reason why that's significant is because if you take the Old Testament to prophecies
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.440]   being fulfilled literally, it doesn't make sense to not interpret all the other prophecies
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.040]   the same way, because that's the pattern that we see.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.160]   Now that doesn't mean that therefore everything is going to happen exactly, that when the
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.320]   end time comes that a white, literal white horse is going to be galloping around and
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.560]   a red horse is going to be coming, you know.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.720]   It doesn't mean that every single thing that we see in the book of Revelation should be
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   taken perfectly literally.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:28.080]   But the literal approach to understanding and interpreting Scripture seems to be the
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:34.360]   most consistent way that I see that the Old Testament was fulfilled.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.360]   He said he was going to ride on a donkey, he rode on a donkey.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.640]   He said somebody was going to betray him, he was betrayed.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.840]   That he was going to be born in Bethlehem, he was born in Bethlehem.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.880]   He was going to be, he was going to suffer, and he suffered, right?
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.960]   I mean so all of these prophecies in the Old Testament was literally fulfilled.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.160]   Why would the king, why would the Messiah suffer?
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.960]   So because it didn't make sense to the Jews, they just dismissed it.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.560]   So when it actually happened, like what was going on?
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.000]   He said it was written, it was written.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.760]   So how many times does Jesus say in the course of his three years, "Have you not read?
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.120]   Have you not read?"
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:18.760]   And then he says to fulfill all prophecy, he would do something, right?
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:26.720]   Whether it's the Lord's Supper, whether it's his crucifixion, even the details of how he
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.360]   was going to go to the cross, who was going to hand him over, all of that is fulfilled
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.520]   literally exactly the way it says.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.160]   Now are there some certain things that were not completely literal?
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.840]   Of course.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.320]   But for the most part it was literal.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.120]   It happened literally, right?
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:50.560]   So having said that, am I a pre-tribulation, pre-millennial?
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.000]   I would say what I lean toward, and I'm thinking at the end of the study of the book of Revelation,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   I may change.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.920]   I don't know, right?
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   I may change.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.480]   I'm not going to go in there looking for my view.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.800]   I'm going to go in there just like you guys, just study from passage to passage, and I'm
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.960]   not so committed to any of the things that I have that I can't change.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.080]   If I see something that I can't interpret in any other way, I'm just going to present
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.200]   it as I see it, and then you guys can judge for yourself.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.560]   But having said all that, do I have a predisposition?
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.720]   Yes, I do.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.080]   I'm a post-trib, pre-millennial.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.560]   That may mean something to some of you, and it may not mean anything to any of you, but
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.120]   we're going to study that as we go along.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:45.600]   I believe in the traditional dispensational camp, post-trib is not a majority view.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:52.440]   There are a few people, a few very smart, good people.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.200]   But there's some, but they're not the majority.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.720]   But to me, it seems like the church is going to go through the tribulation.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.040]   The millennium seems very confusing, and I'm going to get to that in a minute.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:14.820]   It seems very confusing, but if we take his promises to the nation of Israel literally,
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:22.980]   if we take the revelation in the book of Revelation literally as much as possible, then the millennium
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.820]   seems like a literal kingdom.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.540]   And I'll explain that.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.140]   Again, I'm not going to go into all of that today, but this is just kind of give you a
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:36.700]   preview of how we're going to be approaching this book.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.700]   So I've mentioned all of this.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.400]   We'll be approaching the book of Revelation with a combination of bits and pieces from
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:51.020]   all of the views above, meaning I think in the second part of this, it says it is consistent
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.900]   with the interpretation and application of the properties of the prophecy of the Old
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:02.060]   Testament to apply a tri-layered, tri-level method of interpretation.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.380]   Those of you who are with us in the study of the book of Isaiah, remember I mentioned
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:12.260]   this repeatedly over and over, that most of the prophecies in the Old Testament in the
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:17.540]   minor prophets and the major prophets has three applications.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.580]   One is the historical thing that they were seeing.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:25.540]   So when we started the book of Isaiah, Isaiah was prophesying about the judgment coming,
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:30.140]   that because of all their sins, the Babylonians are going to come and take them into captivity.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:36.460]   And so there was a physical, historical thing that they were seeing and God was using that
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.900]   to prophesy.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:44.500]   But just like a lot of the other prophecies, God uses that as an opportunity to prophesy
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.840]   something further than that.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.400]   And so the second level of interpretation is how that's fulfilled.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.380]   So when these prophecies about the Israelites returning, right, the remnant of Israel is
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.740]   going to return, when did that happen physically?
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   After 70 years.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:07.740]   They went to Babylon, Babylonia for 70 years and then King Cyrus is raised up and a small,
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:13.580]   very small remnant of the Israelites come back to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:18.340]   So there's prophecies about them being taken out and then there's a fulfillment of them
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.940]   returning with the remnants historically, right?
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.500]   But there's a second level of restoration when, remember we just talked about that this
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.900]   week, the remnant of the Israelites, right?
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:35.420]   Those of you guys who are paying attention to Sunday's message, right, where Paul takes
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:41.300]   the prophecies of the book of Isaiah and he says, remember God says that a remnant will
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.580]   return and he's talking about the fulfillment in Christ.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.180]   That not everybody's going to receive the gospel, a remnant of Israelites are going
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.860]   to receive the gospel and a small percentage of them are going to return to Christ.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:57.900]   So there's a second level of application that's fulfilled because of what Jesus has done on
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.060]   the cross, right?
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:05.900]   And then the third and final application of the remnant and the kingdom of God being restored
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.020]   is at the end time.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:15.260]   When what he started is completed at the end, right, the real fulfillment of his kingdom
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:19.500]   and all his people coming together is going to be fulfilled at the end.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:24.300]   So as we're studying through the book of Isaiah, we are always looking for the historical,
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.660]   at least as much as we could if there was something clear.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.740]   We're looking for how does this fulfilled in Christ and his coming, death and resurrection,
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:37.860]   establishment of the church and then ultimately what does this point to in the end times,
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:43.500]   whether it's in the millennium or in the eternal kingdom of God, how is this fulfilled, right?
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.020]   That's how we approach the prophecy in the Old Testament and that's how we're going to
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.820]   approach the book of Revelation.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:54.780]   We're going to be looking for historical things that he must be pointing to, like what is
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:01.700]   John seeing and how would have John interpreted this and how would he have applied this in
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.820]   what he was seeing, right?
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:08.220]   And then the second application of that is the prophecies that he's talking about, how
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.440]   is that fulfilled in Christ, right?
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.620]   Now John is on this side of the covenant, the new covenant, so how is that in the church
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.140]   fulfilled?
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.780]   And then third and finally, how is it going to point to the future?
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:26.040]   So our approach is going to be a combination of all of them, right?
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.780]   Are there certain things that we should take as allegorical?
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:40.540]   Yes, there are certain things that are going to look like it's meant to be taken allegorically.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:44.180]   And so when those things come, we're going to do our best to see, well, why did God put
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.180]   that in there?
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.180]   What did he mean by that?
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.420]   So our interpretation is not going to be just one base.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.380]   We're not going to look for a pre-tribulation or post-tribulation view and then force it
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.140]   to fit, right?
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.780]   If it doesn't fit, we're just going to admit, hey, this is one of those verses that's not
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.620]   going to fit that, okay?
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.460]   Did I lose you?
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.820]   Okay.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.500]   I know it's a little bit tricky, but I feel like it's necessary at least for some of you
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.740]   guys who are coming in thinking, I want to jump in, I want to dig through the book of
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.340]   Revelation.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:22.540]   All these things are kind of like boundaries to help you to see how we're approaching this,
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.100]   okay?
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.500]   Some helpful terms, eschatology, the term, it's not in the book of Revelation.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.180]   It just basically means the study of end times.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:36.140]   I've mentioned the term millennium a bunch of times already.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.460]   If you don't know this term, don't feel bad.
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:43.500]   First time I heard this term was in seminary, right, when I was taking systematic theology
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.300]   and said, "Millenniums, hmm, what does that word mean?"
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.300]   As we were being taught.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.860]   So if you don't know it, hopefully you'll know it by the end of the study.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:57.260]   It's after the tribulation, again, this is a pre-trib view or post-trib view.
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:02.740]   Jesus Christ will set up an earthly kingdom where he will rule for a thousand years.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:12.740]   And that is a specific interpretation of Revelation chapter 20 verses 3 and 4.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:19.780]   Amillennialism, it's the belief that there will be no literal thousand-year reign of
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.780]   Christ.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:26.420]   Thus, Revelation chapter 20 is taken symbolically, not literally, by the adherence of this view.
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.260]   Is it big enough that you can see?
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.820]   People in the back, are the letters big enough that you can see?
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.820]   That's okay?
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   All right.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:40.380]   Okay, so amillennial, just like the word says, is they don't believe in a literal millennial.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:49.660]   So if you're an amillennial, what does Revelation chapter 20 mean?
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:55.020]   The way they will interpret it is the millennial reign of Christ is through the church.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.700]   This is the millennium now, right?
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.260]   And the word thousand is just a symbolic word.
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.340]   It doesn't mean a literal thousand words.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:07.740]   So amillennialists will simply say from the time of Christ until his second coming, we're
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:12.660]   in the thousand-year reign of Christ and his kingdom is his church.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.940]   That's how they'll interpret it.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.980]   But within the amillennial view, there is a post-millennial.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:23.180]   Post-millennial, which is right there.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:30.220]   So the post-millennial view, which is right here, should have separated these.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:35.140]   The post-millennial view believe that Jesus will gradually establish his kingdom on earth
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.180]   through the gospel preaching of his body in the church.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.500]   So the difference between the amillennial and the post-millennial, the post-millennial
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:47.500]   and amillennial pretty much hold the same view, except post-millennials believe that
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.740]   because of the reign of Christ through his church, that everything is going to become
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.420]   better and better, that more and more people are going to convert.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.140]   And as a result of more and more people converting, the earth is going to get better.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:02.760]   There's going to be peace on earth and Christianity is going to dominate the world.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.580]   And that's how the millennium is going to be established, right?
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:15.000]   Now, post-millennial view, if you were not a futurist, if you're not a dispensationalist,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.660]   the term amillennialism didn't even exist until probably after World War I or II.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:24.660]   Or if it existed, it wasn't very popular, right?
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:30.740]   So people who held to the historical view typically were post-millennialists.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:35.700]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:41.020]   Because they believe that this whole period of time between Christ and then the second
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.540]   coming of, second coming, is during the period of Christ's reign.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.200]   That's a thousand year reign of Christ.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:51.480]   And so they believed that as the gospel goes forth and more and more people are converted
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:55.680]   to Christianity, that this is going to somehow make the world better.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.880]   And as the world gets better, Christ's second coming is going to, at the end, he's going
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.960]   to come when it gets better and better and better.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:07.280]   Now why do you think that the amillennial view came in after World War I?
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.980]   It was pretty clear, right?
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:17.640]   After they see the world just going nuts, right?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.240]   They've seen more people killed.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.080]   And this wasn't just one nation against a nation.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.940]   This was like half the world fighting against the other half the world.
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.920]   And actually happens twice.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.480]   And as a result of that, they start losing hope that maybe the world isn't going to get
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   better, right?
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.160]   They thought with the advancement of technology, the more and more missionaries going out.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:44.380]   So those of you guys who studied European history, you know that a lot of the Christianities
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:50.180]   and the missionaries, they would typically sail along with the colonialists.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:53.980]   And they would a lot of times forcibly convert people.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.480]   And then you would call it revival.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:01.280]   So if you ever go to any country where they were colonized, there's usually some mission
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.580]   organization or mission something there that the missionaries kind of got on the same boat
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:11.140]   as these colonialists and came and evangelized.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.720]   But when they saw what they were doing, you know, because a lot of them were forcefully
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:21.540]   converting people to Christianity, the emperors at one point got mad because of the Christians.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:27.040]   So they didn't distinguish between the Christians and the soldiers that was coming and the businessmen.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.340]   They looked at them all the same.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.960]   And so when they realized what they were doing, they kicked everybody out.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.460]   That happened in China, that happened in Japan, that happened in India.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.620]   Actually it's kind of happening in India now, right?
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:42.900]   Because they had this mentality that Christ is going to return when the whole world converts
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.760]   to Christians.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.640]   And that was the post-millennial view, right?
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.600]   So obviously God, Jesus doesn't say to go forcefully convert people, but they kind of
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.800]   misapplied it.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:59.360]   And then when it looked like that Christianity wasn't going to be, it wasn't this utopia
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.300]   that the world is headed toward, in fact it's going exactly the opposite, a lot of them
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.920]   converted to amillennialism, right?
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:14.520]   So post-millennial view today is very, very minor, small group of people believe in this
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.920]   view.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.360]   Most people who are not dispensationalists will adhere to the amillennial view, just
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:31.400]   because the reality is the world is not getting better, okay?
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   A couple more things.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.320]   Tribulation is a period of time lasting seven years.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.640]   And then we don't need to worry about the three and a half years and what happens in
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.960]   between and what happens at the end.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.360]   We'll talk about that a little bit when we get there.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.760]   Then within the tribulation, there's pre-trip, mid-trip, post-trip.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.800]   And the reason why there's pre-trip, mid-trip, post-trip is when is exactly Jesus is going
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   to come?
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.320]   Is he going to come before the pre-trip?
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.640]   So typical pre-tribulation view is that there's going to be seven years.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:07.240]   So all of these warnings about disaster, about the third of the world being wiped out, the
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.840]   disease and natural disasters and wars, that all of this is taking place during the seven
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.100]   years.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.780]   The three and a half years begins it.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:22.320]   And then the second half of the tribulation is intense where all the horrific things that
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.680]   are described in the book of Revelation, they believe it's going to happen the second part
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.160]   of the seven years.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.560]   So pre-trip, people believe that the church is going to be saved from that.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.560]   How are we saved?
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.880]   What's called a rapture, right?
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.920]   And those of you guys who saw Left Behind, that's what that whole thing was about, that
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.120]   the rapture takes place and church is preserved from that.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:48.280]   Pre-trip believes that the church is going to go through the non-intense, right?
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.560]   They're going to go through it, but they're not going to go through all of it.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:55.400]   You're going to be preserved from the intense part, the second three and a half years.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   That's the mid-trip.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.240]   Post-trip view, which is what I lean toward, is that the church is going to go through
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   all of it.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:06.880]   It's going to experience the intense persecution and Christians dying, being martyred left
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.880]   and right.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.760]   And then at the end of that, Christ is going to come and he's going to establish his millennium,
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.760]   his kingdom on earth.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:20.000]   But it's all going to happen with the persecution toward Christians intensifying more and more.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.960]   And again, whether you believe that the literal seven years or it's a figurative number, that's
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.680]   what the tribulation is referring to typically.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.680]   Okay?
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.400]   And we'll go over that a little bit more when we get to it.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   Okay?
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   All right.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.040]   So that's it for the orientation for today.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.640]   And again, you have this in front of you.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.160]   Those of you guys who've never studied through the book of Revelation or any prophetic writings,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.000]   I know some of you guys may have been interested, thinking like, "Oh, I'm so excited to study
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.960]   book of Revelation so that I can know exactly when Jesus is going to come."
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:45:02.360]   Or maybe talk about Kim Jong-un and how he fits into the prophecies of the book of Revelation.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.440]   Or where does America fit in to all these prophecies?
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.720]   Maybe you came in with those kinds of curiosities.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:13.560]   And I can tell you already that I'm probably not going to go there.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.240]   In fact, I'm absolutely certain I'm not going to go there.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:21.300]   You know, because all of these things, the best that I can tell you is it could be.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.720]   No one knows, right, until it happens.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:30.740]   But I believe that God left enough so that when it happens, you'll know.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:34.160]   If you've been studying through the book of Revelation carefully, when it happens, you'll
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.080]   be able to identify, right?
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.640]   Same thing with Jesus.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:45.080]   There was enough about Jesus that if you knew the prophecies about him, you could see, "Wow,
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.560]   he clearly fits that."
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.560]   Remember Apollos?
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.440]   Apollos was teaching through the Old Testament and then he didn't even know that Jesus came.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:57.240]   And then Priscilla and Achilla heard him and say, "Hey, that sounds like he's talking about
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.240]   the Messiah."
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:02.640]   And he actually pulls him aside, goes to the Old Testament and say, "This man was here."
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.040]   You know, he actually was here.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.760]   And so that's how much, how clear it was that he was preaching about the Messiah from the
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.800]   Old Testament.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.520]   And so I believe that the Revelation was given for that purpose so that we would look at
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.960]   it carefully, study it, and maybe even contemplate, "Could it be this?
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.600]   Maybe Kim Jong-un is going to play a role.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   Who knows?"
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.320]   You know, we don't know.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:31.840]   But at least it's enough so that when it does happen, when the things of the prophecies
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.880]   of the Revelation happens, that there's enough, there's enough glimpses of it, shadows of
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.560]   it that you can clearly say, "It must be this."
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.640]   And that's what he was telling us to live each day, eagerly waiting for that, that this
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   is coming.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.240]   It may come in your lifetime.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:54.640]   It may come maybe after your lifetime, but there clearly is an end to all of this.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   All of this sanctification, struggling and striving, preaching the gospel, wrestling,
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:05.680]   that our time on earth, whether we die physically or whether he comes, is limited.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.280]   And there is a clear ending to all of this.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:12.800]   And that's what this book of Revelation is really to point to, is to remind us that victory
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.560]   in Christ is absolutely certain.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.800]   And so hopefully that, as we're studying through this, that that's the message that you're
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.520]   going to be getting over and over, right?
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.960]   So I think we should be curious.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:28.400]   If you have questions, I encourage you to ask them and have honest conversations in
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.240]   your small groups, and even with me, you can come and ask.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.760]   I can give you my two cents.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.200]   Doesn't mean it's right, but I can just give you my boot.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.640]   But I think the discussion of these things will be sanctifying for our church.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.400]   Even if it comes out and say, "I'm confused," I think that confusion is healthy.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.040]   That means you are wrestling with the text.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.000]   And I think that ultimately that's our goal in this book of Revelation.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   Okay?
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.920]   All right, some discussion questions that I have, which I can't read.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.760]   Okay, this definitely is too small.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   I can't read it.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.520]   So you, yeah.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.640]   So today you guys don't have small groups, so if you guys can just make small groups
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.400]   from your group for today, and then take some time to discuss these questions.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   Does this need to be bigger?
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.400]   Or can you actually see it?
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   You can see it?
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   Okay.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.280]   If not, just come up and take a picture or something.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.280]   Okay?
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.240]   So get into groups of maybe about four or five and take some time to discuss this.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.320]   And then afterwards, we'll have some snacks set up in the back.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.960]   And then starting from next week, we'll start your small groups.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   Okay?
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.560]   Oh, sorry, sorry.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.520]   If you haven't signed up, we need you to sign up.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   How are we going to put them in groups?
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:57.280]   >> It's going to be generally with your similar age groups.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.280]   >> Okay.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.480]   All right, we'll figure it out.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   All right.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.840]   But if you haven't signed up, please sign up so that at least we'll have your name and
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.840]   be able to put you in it.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:10.760]   So if you happen to be in a group and say, "Hey, we don't want to be split up.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.440]   There's six of us that wants to stay together," please email us ahead of time.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   Okay?
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.560]   And you're going to have to do it together so that we'll be able to do that together.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   Okay?
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:26.560]   All right, let me pray for us, and then I'll ask you guys to get in your small group.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:33.120]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for just the privilege that we have to be able to gather
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.920]   together and study your Word.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:42.640]   And there's a lot of things that are confusing about this book, a lot of things, Lord, that
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.960]   even after we study, we may not clearly know.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.800]   But I pray that every single minute that we spend wrestling with the text and trying to
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:55.040]   figure out the meaning and application of all of these things will be sanctifying to
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.640]   our souls.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:03.080]   Help us to think more deeply upon the coming of Christ and to eagerly wait for him to live
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:09.080]   each day, knowing, Father God, that our days here are numbered, whether it is just physically
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:16.040]   living our days out or at some point Christ returning, maybe even possibly in our life.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:21.160]   I pray, Father God, that whatever the case may be, help us to live each day to know that
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:26.320]   this is not our home, that you will one day bring to completion what you started on the
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.860]   cross.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:33.760]   And I pray, Father God, that our church may be sanctified, that we will grow and mature
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.960]   and sober as we eagerly wait for your return.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.480]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
