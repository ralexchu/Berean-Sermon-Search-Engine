[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.680]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Ephesians chapter 3, verse 14 and on.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.520]   Jump into part two of the message that we started last week and kind of preparing us
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.600]   for our vision and our focus coming into this new year.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.800]   Hope and pray.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   Last year it was watch and pray and this year we want to focus on our hope which leads us
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.800]   to pray.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.660]   So Ephesians chapter 3, verse 14 to 21, NASV says, "For this reason I bow my knees before
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.880]   the Father for the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.880]   in the inner man.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.360]   So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and grounded
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.520]   in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.120]   and height and depth and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge that you
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.080]   may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.640]   Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think according
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.160]   to the power that works within us.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.880]   To him be the glory in which in the church and in Christ Jesus to all the generations
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880]   forever and ever.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   Amen."
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480]   Let's pray.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.560]   Heavenly Father we pray that you would protect this pulpit, protect this church, that whatever
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.200]   goes forth would only be your thoughts and your words.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.680]   I pray that you would prepare our hearts Lord God to receive a blessing from you and that
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.320]   our hearts may continue to be transformed, that our lives may be conformed to what you
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.560]   desire of us.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.520]   May your name be magnified this morning in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.520]   Amen.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   Amen.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   Amen.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:02.200]   Most church historians will agree that before a church falls or maybe even a generation
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.740]   of churches falls, there's two things that get sucked out of the church.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.680]   The first is the word of God.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.360]   That we begin to stray from the word of God and we use our own moral compass as a determination
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360]   of what is right and wrong.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.320]   What bothers me, what doesn't bother me is based upon what I think.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.080]   And so the word of God begins to get drained out of the church.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.920]   And then the second thing that gets neglected is prayer.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   And when you have a church that begins to neglect the word and it begins to run the
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.360]   church based upon what each generation and each church, each pastor thinks is right according
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.280]   to his vision, his thoughts, then that's the first step that you see before the church
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   becomes a nominal church where it has a form of godliness with no power.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.480]   But then the second thing that it begins to drain itself of is prayer.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.080]   That prayer just becomes a word, it just becomes an afterthought.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.440]   We sprinkle on the things that we do and it is not a passionate pursuit that we have in
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.880]   prayer.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.000]   So from the very beginning of our church, we wanted to make sure that we do not neglect
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   the word of God.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.720]   That's why we named our church Berean.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.960]   We wanted to make sure that the word of God is at the center.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.040]   So there are certain things that I may say that may offend you, but we're trying to be
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.320]   faithful to the word of God.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.600]   My litmus test of what should be said and not be said is not does it offend you or not
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.160]   offend you.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.160]   Is it biblical?
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.200]   Is it not biblical?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.800]   And so we've been doing that for the last 25 years that we've been in existence in the
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   church.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.680]   And so we're kind of, you know, some of you have chosen to be at a church for that reason.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.280]   But the second part of neglecting prayer is just as important as the first.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.760]   It is not any lesser important.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.120]   As long as we have the word, the prayer is something that we ought to work on.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.280]   Prayer is just as important.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.440]   As detrimental as it is to neglect the word of God, it is equally detrimental to neglect
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.880]   prayer.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.480]   And so this is something that we recognize in our church and we've been recognizing for
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.000]   years and years and we want to continue to do to emphasize this, that we want to make
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.520]   sure that the word of God is lifted up and that we are committed and devoted to prayer,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.800]   not just to pray, but to be devoted to pray.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:38.200]   You know, I am by no means an example of a prayer warrior and I want to be, but you know,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   that's my honest confession.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.700]   And so I want myself and I want our church to continue to move toward that direction.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:52.360]   But what I am thankful for is very early on in my faith, I was surrounded by prayer warriors.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.880]   The ministry that I got saved in a long time ago in the early 80s, they weren't known for
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   their word.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.960]   In fact, I can't remember too many things that I learned from that ministry.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.420]   But one thing that I did know is that they were committed to praying.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.040]   So every Friday night from 10 to somewhere around 1 to 2 in the morning, every Friday
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.760]   night, teenagers gathered together in LA and we would pray.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.080]   And sometimes you would sleep overnight and then go witnessing in the morning.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.280]   But the whole ministry was just about prayer.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.020]   They had a separate prayer school where all through the week people would come and learn
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.960]   how to pray and continue to pray, take us up to the mountains to pray.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.680]   And so I'm very thankful that I was around people who are older than me who are really
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.720]   committed to pray.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.360]   I remember a particular missionary when I was at Biola who was in furlough and he was
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.600]   waiting and being trained to be sent back out.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.480]   And he would fast 30 days every single year.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.800]   And if somebody told me that, I'd say, "Oh, that sounds like church history, somewhere
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   down the way."
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.360]   I actually knew this guy.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.880]   And every year he would just shrink and we would see him and say we would know he is
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.520]   fasting because we would literally shrink.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.800]   And so for two weeks he would just kind of attend class and do everything normally.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.000]   And then the last two weeks he would go up to the mountains and then spend the other
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   time praying.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.180]   And he would do this every year.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.480]   And I knew him for about four years.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.360]   And so it was challenging to see him so committed to fasting.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.560]   And years later, before Bill Bright, some of you guys may know who Bill Bright is.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.080]   He's the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.000]   And we happened to be at a conference where Bill Bright was there.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.800]   And so a few of the younger pastors, about 30 or 40 of us, we were in a room and were
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.680]   able to meet with him and pick his brain about ministry and various things.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:49.080]   And I remember in his latter years of ministry, he was committed to fasting.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.800]   And so he was pleading with us, with the younger generation pastors, and telling us that, "You
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.480]   guys need to pick up fasting."
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.760]   That after all the things that he has done to establish campus ministries and share the
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.400]   gospel, he said, "Above all," he said, "you have to commit to praying, in particular to
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.480]   fasting."
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.040]   All the people that I've known, and I could probably pull a lot more than what I'm saying,
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.880]   but I remember this two missionaries that I ended up going to China with when I first
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.320]   went, I think it was 1993.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.000]   And we were touring China for about a month.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.200]   And these two missionaries, they would never come out to breakfast.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   So I thought, "Maybe they're being lazy.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.920]   Maybe they slept late and then they just skipped breakfast and then they're going to come out
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   for lunch."
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.840]   And it took me about a week to realize that they weren't skipping breakfast, they were
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   fasting.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.560]   And so every breakfast, they would stay in and have their time with the Lord and pray.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.320]   And this one particular lady named Amy, she was a bit older than I was, and then I was
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.600]   able to get to know her.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.680]   And then every opportunity I had, I was trying to pick her brain because I could tell she
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.160]   was communing with God so intimately, just constantly praying and fasting.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:07.520]   And I remember very vividly this passing statement that she made to me because we would sit together
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.200]   while we were traveling to various places and I would ask her about her prayer life
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.000]   because I see how important this was to her.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.100]   And I remember she said, after spending some time praying together, she said, "Every time
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.680]   you pray, you're always praying for protection."
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.920]   And he said, "Not that there's anything wrong with that, but do you know who you're praying
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.240]   to?"
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:37.040]   And then she said, "Our prayers should be a prayer for victory, not a prayer of fear."
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.640]   And I remember she just said that in passing because there's a lady who was so committed
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.800]   to praying and that just made a deep impression.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   It's like, "That's so true."
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   Right?
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.280]   Like, I'm so concerned about my circumstance that I don't realize who I'm praying to and
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.060]   my prayers reflect me more than it reflects him.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.080]   But all the people that I can remember in my life that I could say, "Those people were
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.560]   prayer warriors," the first thing that comes to mind was they were all humble people.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.300]   Every single one of them.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.800]   They weren't showy, they weren't telling us.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.720]   In fact, I would have never known that they were fasting in the morning.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.960]   It was just, I just caught them.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.000]   They never told us that this is what they were doing.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.400]   Every day they were, in fact, I thought they were just being lazy.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.160]   They're not waking up.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.480]   And they were humble people.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.400]   That's the first thing I remember.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.160]   There was a love for Christ that you can't really describe.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.320]   You can say, "Well, they love the Word and they love evangelism and they did this and
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:42.880]   they did that," but there was something about their affection for Christ that's intangible.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.400]   It's not like I couldn't have conversations about trivial things.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.240]   We would talk about various things in the culture and the food that we were eating.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.880]   We were in a different city and in almost every city.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.160]   But every trivial conversation that we had, we would almost always end up talking about
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.780]   Christ.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.560]   And it's not because they had some sort of plan.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.080]   It was just that's what's always in their heart.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.960]   Just like somebody who's like avid Lakers fan, you know what I mean?
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.960]   And you see it.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.160]   They wear Lakers socks, Laker underwear.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.560]   I mean, they're just committed to this.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.640]   And whenever you have a conversation, it eventually ends up going to talk about Lakers or Dodgers
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.520]   or whatever it is that you're a fanatic of.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.120]   And you could tell that every single one of these people that I remember is that they
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:32.080]   had this love for Christ that is just infectious being around them.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.020]   But every single one of them were all driven people.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.720]   You would think they're humble, they love Christ, that they just kind of, you know,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.840]   like everything is good, nothing bothers them.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.560]   In fact, of all the people that I know, they were the most driven.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:53.040]   They were so fixated on not only for what they had, but to spread the gospel, to have
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.840]   as many people come to love Christ as they love Christ.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   And so their life was lived very intentionally, purposefully, and headed either toward missions
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.240]   or discipling somebody.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.880]   But every opportunity they had, they had a clear purpose and they were very driven people.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.520]   Now I say all of this because I'm very thankful that God gave me these people that are even
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:23.360]   just in my memory, that this is why prayer is so important.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.280]   And I remember every conversation that I had with them, I came away thinking that I heard
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.000]   a really good sermon.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.320]   And it's not because they said something, you know, articulate or they exposited the
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.760]   text better than somebody else.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:42.680]   It was just that there was this nearness to Christ that was infectious.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.720]   And I kind of think about when Moses came back from meeting God and his glory was shining
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:53.520]   off of his face and people knew immediately because of the glory shining off of them that
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.280]   Moses was with God.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.540]   And it created fear because the glory was so powerful.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.160]   And that's what I remember about them, that there are certain things that I would not
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.600]   say, certain things that I would not do in their presence because it just made me think
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.800]   like I was closer to God when I was with them.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   Prayer is just as essential.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.840]   When we focus on the Word of God without humbling ourselves before the Lord in prayer, the Word
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.840]   of God becomes knowledge.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.520]   And when you have a man or a woman who's not humble before God and you fill that man with
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.360]   knowledge, immediately it turns into pride.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.060]   And when the pride fills a man, the next step is judgment.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.920]   That's almost always, that's the route that it goes.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.060]   So it's not that the Word of God is not important, but when the Word of God is not coupled with
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:55.680]   humility and desperateness before God, it almost always turns into pride and judgment.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:02.160]   And so all the more why, as a church, we emphasize the Word of God where we absolutely must be
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.480]   devoted to prayer.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.120]   We need to come before God.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.320]   Last week it says, "For this reason," and the reason that we talked about was three
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.680]   chapters of explaining the living hope that we have in Christ.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.960]   We have the whole purpose of why you and I are gathered here together is because we have
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.200]   this access to God that we couldn't have because of the blood of Christ.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.360]   So if the whole purpose is to have the door open, to have a living hope in God, the next
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.200]   step, obviously, is then come.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.800]   And so he says, "For this reason, we need to pray," and then the manner in which we
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:43.960]   pray says, "To bow our knees before Him, to surrender ourselves to Him, that no one can
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:52.160]   come to God in communion who has not surrendered himself, that as much as He is our Savior,
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.600]   He is our Lord, He is also our King."
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.680]   And so it says, "For this reason, we ought to pray, bowing our knees."
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.320]   And then this morning I want to highlight three aspects of why we need to pray, the
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.960]   source of prayer, the means of prayer, and the goal of prayer.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.860]   And so basically that's going to be the outline of this morning, those three points.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.040]   And before I even jump in, I want to emphasize this because the Trinity is highlighted in
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.800]   this text in prayer.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.660]   The source of our prayer is God the Father.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.440]   The means of prayer is the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.620]   And then the goal of prayer is Jesus Christ.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.960]   So you can clearly see the work of the Holy Spirit in the call to pray.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   Now whenever you see all three persons of the Trinity that is engaged in something particular,
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.760]   we're supposed to take a step back and realize this is important.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.740]   Not to say that if there's a mention of Christ and the work that He's done, that that independently
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:58.160]   isn't important, or the power that we receive because of the Holy Spirit, that that in and
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   of itself somehow is not important, or the work of God the Father who initiated His love
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.440]   and was shown us mercy.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.040]   Independently is just as important.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.160]   But when you see all three elements coming together, you know that this is something
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.540]   that we ought to pay very close attention to.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:21.820]   Where God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son are actively working together
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.120]   to call us to this activity, which is to pray.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.680]   So the first thing that we want to look at is God the Father as the source.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.680]   And the first thing that He says in verse 15 is, "From whom every family in heaven and
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.840]   on earth derives its name."
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.960]   And the reason why He mentions that in the call to prayer is to recognize that that's
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.660]   exactly where we come from.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.800]   That's who we are.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.200]   So the whole purpose of why salvation was given to us so that we may be restored back
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.840]   to why He created us in the first place.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.160]   That we may be His image bearers.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.080]   And that's basically what He is saying.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.920]   As I mentioned to you a couple weeks ago, we adopted two cats.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.680]   I didn't.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.680]   You know, my kids did.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.960]   My wife did.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.800]   And so therefore, I did.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.400]   And one of the things that I observed that's interesting to me is that these cats, because
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.680]   they came to us as kittens, you know, they weren't properly trained.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.600]   They weren't discipled to be cats.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.240]   They were born as cats.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:29.400]   So one of the things that's interesting to me is the way they play and the way what's
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:35.600]   interesting to watch is even though they never watched this, they didn't have, you know,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.920]   like older cats to show them this is what they're supposed to do.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:44.000]   Whenever they play, they play like they're catching a mouse.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.120]   So they would hunker down and then put the pressure on their back legs and then they
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.080]   would jump up into the sky and then they would pounce.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.600]   And I said, oh, that's if you're going to catch mice, that's exactly what you would
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   need to do.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   Right.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.840]   But it's interesting that they never watched any other cats do that.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.280]   They just did that instinctively.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:10.000]   So they have cat like reflexes because they're cats.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.780]   Because they're created that way.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.680]   So their vision, their senses, their legs, their muscle distribution, all of that was
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.480]   created for a particular purpose.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.400]   So I look at that and they're playing and they're kind of playing the role of what a
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.800]   cat normally does because obviously they're house pets.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.520]   Now I use that as an example because when cats do that, they're instinctively doing
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.440]   what they were created to do.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.320]   See, the Bible says that you and I have been created to become image bearers of Christ.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.000]   But because of our sin and we fell away from God, we're trying to figure out and everybody
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.560]   is doing what they think is right in their own eyes.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.480]   And so every year we have this question, what do I want?
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.240]   What would I like to do?
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.080]   And so we live our lives based upon what brings the greatest pleasure to us.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:04.720]   And in this pursuit of our own pleasure and meaning, we are condemned and we are lost.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:11.280]   At the end of our lives, we come to the same conclusion that Solomon did.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.000]   Empty, empty.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.240]   Meaningless, meaningless.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.200]   And every generation tries to prove the previous generation wrong, but every generation only
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.680]   confirms what they've said for thousands of years.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   Empty, empty.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.480]   At the end of all your pursuit, empty, empty.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.480]   All is empty.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.480]   Vanity, vanity.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.960]   All is vanity.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   And that's why he's saying, he's recognizing the Father who calls us to come to him, he's
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.760]   the one who created us.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:52.560]   But secondly, he says that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.680]   According to the riches of his glory.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.920]   It reveals to us that the Father who calls us to pray, to come to him, is not playing
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.520]   hide and seek.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:10.620]   He's eager according to the riches of his glory.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.760]   Jesus shares that in the story of the three parables.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.740]   When he talks about in the Gospel of Luke, where you have the first one where the sheep
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:29.080]   goes astray and the one of the hundred, and he goes out spending all his energy bringing
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.420]   him back, bringing the sheep back and they celebrate.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.340]   The second one is the coin that's lost and the lady sweeps the whole house, finds it
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.480]   in celebration.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:42.260]   But the real point is the third one, the prodigal son, where the father is eagerly waiting for
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.280]   this repentant son to come back.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.100]   And instead of saying, you know what, you blew all this money and you were disrespectful,
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.740]   now you go out and feed the pigs and you earn yourself way back.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.700]   Instead, Jesus paints a picture of God the Father eagerly waiting for his son.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.820]   And as soon as he sees his son on the horizon, he runs out to him, puts on the robe, put
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.880]   his slippers and he welcomes him back into the house.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.820]   That's how Jesus painted the picture of God the Father.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.420]   That he is rich in glory.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.100]   He's not simply saying, well, try your best and then if you earn your way to me, that
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.100]   I'll answer your prayers.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.260]   He says it's according to his riches in glory.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.900]   Ephesians 1, 7-8, it says, "In him we have redemption through his blood, forgiveness
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:32.180]   of trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished on us in all
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.180]   wisdom and insight."
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.260]   He didn't just give us grace.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:41.380]   Grace in and of itself is receiving something that you and I did not deserve.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:47.300]   But he said he didn't just give us grace, he said he lavished us with grace.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.700]   According to the riches of his glory.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:56.840]   You ever wonder why the feeding of the 5,000, that there were 12 baskets left over?
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.660]   Why did he leave 12 baskets left over?
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.220]   Because every one of those disciples had to carry that.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.740]   If you study the description of the basket, it was not a small tiny basket.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.380]   It was a basket that went from the top of your shoulder all the way down to the ground.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.940]   So it was a pretty big basket.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:19.060]   I can imagine the disciples thinking to themselves, why didn't Jesus just make just enough?
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.780]   Why all this waste?
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.820]   And then they have to carry this heavy thing around.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.540]   Why did Jesus do that?
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.940]   And then when he fed the 4,000, there were 7 baskets left over.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.100]   Why does he do that?
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.140]   There's some of you who invite people over for dinner and you don't know how to cook
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.460]   for 5 people.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.780]   You leave enough for maybe 10 families.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.780]   Some of you guys.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.660]   So if you're in charge of the food, there's always abundance left over.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.340]   And say, well this is kind of waste.
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.900]   Let's make sure that we have enough, but not waste, not a waste.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.900]   Why did Jesus do that?
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.180]   Is it because he couldn't calculate?
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.740]   Everything Jesus does is for a purpose.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:05.300]   And so even in his miracle of feeding them, every single one of those disciples who carried
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:10.260]   them was a reminder to them, this is how God answers our prayers.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.260]   This is who he is.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.900]   He doesn't just want to feed us abundantly beyond.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.120]   He lavishes us with his grace and his mercy.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   This is who he is.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.040]   Ephesians 3 verse 8, it says, "To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.880]   given to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ."
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:37.360]   So the gospel isn't simply that you deserve judgment, but Jesus forgave you.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.240]   See, that would be grace.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   That would be mercy.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.320]   That in and of itself would be worth celebrating the rest of our lives.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.360]   But he made us co-heirs with Christ.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.600]   We are adopted children calling him our Abba Father.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.660]   That we're going to rule with him in eternity.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.560]   The Holy Spirit has been embedded in us.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.580]   So he says, he's not just talking about grace, he's talking about unfathomable riches of
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.600]   Christ.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.840]   He said he was called to teach them this.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.280]   John chapter 15 verse 7, it says, "If my word abideth in you and you abide in me, ask
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.760]   whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.640]   The picture that is painted for us of our God is a God who is eagerly desiring for us
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.960]   to come to him so he can answer our prayers.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.880]   He wants to answer our prayers.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.600]   He says, Psalm 37 verse 4, "Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.100]   of your heart."
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.820]   This is who our God is.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.040]   He's not playing hide and seek and saying, "If you just earn, if you just do this better,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.880]   maybe I'll give you this."
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:54.640]   Our God in his richness and mercy, who lavished his love toward us, is eager to give us when
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.040]   we delight in the Lord.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:04.360]   You know, when we don't recognize who he is, it affects the way that we live our lives.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.240]   You know, with all the things that's been going on around us, you know, economic and
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.480]   the gas prices have been going up.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.680]   You know who doesn't complain about gas prices?
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.680]   Billionaires.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.240]   You know, Mark Zuckerberg doesn't complain every time he sees the 3, 4, 5 cents tick
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   up.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   "What?
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.840]   I got to pay $4.50?"
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.200]   I'm pretty sure the billionaire is just like, "Oh, okay."
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.680]   He hears the chatter but it doesn't bother him.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.280]   It doesn't bother him because he's a billionaire.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.400]   Billionaires are not as bothered by the change of circumstance, the economic turn, because
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   they have all this money.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.520]   It's not going to make a dent in their life.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.840]   See when Christians don't understand the richness that we have in Christ, every little
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.120]   change of circumstance, every little turn, every little opinion of other people, it shakes
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.000]   our foundation.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.320]   And we have to go after change.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320]   "Why are you doing that?
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.100]   How come you're doing that?"
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.520]   Because we're concerned and we're living like we're in poverty.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.560]   See when somebody is poor, they're constantly, every little turn, every little cent, every
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.000]   little thing that they can't save or everything that they lose, it bothers them to the core.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.600]   But he says, "No, we are rich in Him."
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:27.040]   A rich person, a genuinely rich person, isn't as concerned whether people see them as rich
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.200]   or poor because they have all this money.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.640]   Only people who are trying to show off their wealth are people who aren't really rich.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.480]   The really rich people don't need to prove anything.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.960]   And we are rich in Christ.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.560]   We're not as concerned about our reputation and what other people think because I am secure
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.760]   in Him.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.040]   Everything that I need for life of godliness, I have in Him.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.600]   So your opinion, as much as I want, doesn't matter.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.840]   It doesn't shake my foundation.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.280]   But you know what else changes is the rich people, when they walk into a room, their
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.280]   first thought is not, "What you can give me?
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   What can I do?
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   What kind of relationship I can build?
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.280]   What can I get?"
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   Because he's a billionaire.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.920]   I mean, even if you're wealthy, you might have a couple hundred thousand a year or three
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.920]   hundred thousand a year.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.560]   I don't know how much you make.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.900]   But a billionaire doesn't walk into the room thinking, "How can I tap into that?"
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.780]   Because he's a billionaire.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.640]   When he walks into a room, he may be thinking, "What do these people need?
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.960]   How can I help them?"
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.360]   See, when we're not rich in Christ and we forget what it is that we have in Him, every
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.280]   human being becomes an opportunity.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280]   What am I going to do?
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.360]   What do I benefit from this person?
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.120]   And we choose churches based upon, "What are they doing for me?
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.840]   What am I going to get?"
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.760]   And so when I don't get, even when we give, we give hoping that that will somehow return
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   back to me.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.600]   It's an investment.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:57.800]   But when we're rich in Christ, every opportunity is an opportunity to express my gratitude
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.440]   for the riches that I have with Him.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.960]   And so it's important for us to recognize who it is that's calling us.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.000]   So when we're not praying to Him, when we're not communing with Him, we live in spiritual
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.080]   poverty.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.680]   Even though we have this fat bank account, even though we have all the resources that
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.320]   we can possibly imagine, but we live as practical atheists.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:29.520]   We're poor, always looking for somebody else to give me what I want.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.400]   God is our resource, who's rich in mercy, lavished His grace on us.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.000]   He's the one who calls us.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Number two, the means.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.640]   God, the Holy Spirit, is the means for our prayer.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.920]   That's why we receive the power.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.680]   So when the Bible says that at the end times, there's going to be people who have a form
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:54.440]   of godliness and yet without power, He's describing people who are living according to the Word
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.400]   like the Pharisees, but they do not know God.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.760]   So there's no power.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.200]   A church that studies the Word, memorizes the Word, reads a lot of books, and knows
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:12.000]   all the theology and yet is not devoted, devoted to prayer, is exactly what they're talking
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.120]   about.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.880]   Form of godliness, there's no power.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:23.720]   See, it says, verse 16b, "to be strengthened with power through the Holy Spirit in the
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   inner man."
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.640]   It requires power.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.680]   What Jesus was doing physically, He said, the Holy Spirit will do in spirit.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.840]   See, the disciples were always concerned that as long as they were with Jesus, they were
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.200]   safe because Jesus was their answer.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.600]   Jesus was the answer to their enemies.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.240]   Jesus was the answer to their hunger.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.800]   Jesus was the answer to the storms.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.440]   But as He was going, they were being nervous.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.360]   It's like, if you leave, what's going to happen?
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.120]   And that's when He says, the Holy Spirit's going to come.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   And He's going to teach you.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.760]   He's going to guide you.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.480]   Everything that you were relying on Me, you're going to rely on the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.880]   In Romans chapter 8, 26 and 27, it says, "In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weakness.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.320]   For we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.680]   groanings too deep for words.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.560]   And He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is because He intercedes
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.560]   for the saints according to the will of God."
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.080]   The Holy Spirit has been deposited in us.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.200]   There's not a single Christian who does not have the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.720]   But He says the Holy Spirit has been deposited in us in order for the Holy Spirit in His
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.680]   power, in His power, to intercede on our behalf.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.560]   So we say, well, if He's interceding and He's already groaning for us, why do we need to
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.560]   pray?
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.160]   The Holy Spirit's already doing that.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   Well look what He says here.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:51.560]   "For we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us."
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:56.960]   In other words, He's talking to an individual who is praying, but is having a hard time
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   praying.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.120]   He said the Holy Spirit is going to be there to help us.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.520]   He's not telling us, He's like, oh, you have the Holy Spirit, just kind of relax, get on
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.200]   the boat, and the Holy Spirit is just going to guide you through.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.360]   He said He empowers who?
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.760]   Those who pray.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.200]   When did the Holy Spirit come?
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.000]   In the book of Acts.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.800]   When they were gathered in praying.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.080]   They weren't just walking around and having fellowship and communion, all of a sudden
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.160]   the Holy Spirit came.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:33.320]   They were eagerly waiting and they were eagerly praying when the Holy Spirit came, like fire.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.360]   It was in prayer that they received this power.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.000]   Ephesians 4.30, He said, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.480]   for the day of redemption."
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.600]   When we think about grieving, we normally think about sin.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.120]   We're doing things or watching things that we shouldn't watch, and that also is grieving
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.120]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:57.800]   But I think the most common way that we grieve the Holy Spirit is simply not praying.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:03.840]   Because the Holy Spirit has been deposited in us to lead us to Him, and we're not moving.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.360]   We're not cooperating.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.400]   And so, if you've ever tried to train a child, the most frustrating thing is they just don't
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.840]   listen.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:20.000]   And I think the most common way that Christians grieve the Holy Spirit is simply by neglect.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.280]   See, not only does He tell us to pray, because the means in which we communion with God is
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.520]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.960]   The means in which we commune with the Holy Spirit is prayer.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.800]   Ephesians 5.18, He said, "Do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation."
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.520]   Dissipation is another word to say it's disgusting.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.280]   You know how you get drunk with wine?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.760]   You drink too much wine.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.560]   Do you know how you get sober?
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.080]   Don't do it.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.920]   You don't need to do anything to stay sober.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.420]   You just need to not do things that make you drunk.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.000]   And so here, He's talking about to stay sober, to not to get drunk.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.320]   How do we get drunk?
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.760]   When we are saturated by the things of this world, we get drunk by the things of this
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.400]   world.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.680]   It's like if you drink too much, it affects your reasoning, it affects your outlook, it
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.840]   affects your personality.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.400]   It affects what comes out of your mouth.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.080]   It affects who you are and how you see things.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.040]   Because you're being influenced by what's outside.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.400]   So when He says, "Do not get drunk with wine," He's not simply talking about wine.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:37.400]   He's talking about being drunk with anything that causes us not to be sober in Christ.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:43.960]   If we are filling our minds, and even though you say, "Oh, you know, it's just a movie.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.520]   It's just this, it's just that."
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.040]   But when our mind and heart is filled with the things of this world, whether you know
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.120]   it or not, you are drunk with the world.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:59.240]   And it affects your paradigm of what is good and what is bad.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.040]   What is sin and not sin?
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:07.760]   You know, after a while, if you've been sinning the same thing over and over again, you know
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.480]   what begins to happen is we start, instead of calling it sin, we call it a mistake.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.160]   And then from mistake, we go through struggle.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.120]   And then from struggle, it just becomes common.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.080]   Everybody struggles.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.240]   This is what people struggle with.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.000]   And anytime somebody points that out, it's like, "Oh, you're a legalist."
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.240]   So we went from struggling with sin to defending the sin because we've become drunk.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.480]   See, the Holy Spirit convicts us of this, to drive us to Him.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   He intercedes.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   Why is He groaning?
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.520]   What is He groaning about?
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.560]   To bring us to Him, to get us to pray, to commune with Him.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.640]   Without the Holy Spirit, our inner being never changes.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.800]   And I think recently in our generation, we've had people who are bearing so much fruit externally,
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:59.200]   but after they pass, their private life is exposed and realize that their inner being
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.560]   was so corrupt.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.560]   I think without even mentioning anybody's name, I think you know who I'm talking about.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.680]   They weren't the first one, and they won't be the last.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   Where people who have paid all their attention on the external qualities while their inner
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.760]   being was never paid attention to.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.480]   In fact, Jesus is the first one who says that.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   He calls the Pharisees.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.160]   You're like, what?
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   Dead man's tomb.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:28.680]   Where you dress up all the stuff on the outside, but inwardly, it's still a tomb.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.240]   We have dead bones.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.840]   And that's exactly what He's talking about.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.320]   Where we have the appearance of godliness, there's no power.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.000]   Because the power comes from abiding in Christ.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.240]   By the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:50.320]   By groaning and devoting ourselves to the resource that causes the inner person to change.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.200]   That's why if you look at all the qualities, the fruit of the Holy Spirit are inward qualities
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   of gentleness, joy, kindness, patience.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.800]   All of it are inner qualities.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.960]   It doesn't simply say discipline, external hard work.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.480]   All these things are out products of it.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.520]   But the inner quality of patience, gentleness, love.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.120]   These are inner things that the Holy Spirit convicts us of and transforms us so that it's
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.680]   not just external things, but internal things that change.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.800]   And that's exactly what Jesus said.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.520]   It is not what you put into a man corrupts him.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.120]   It's what comes out.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.280]   So the work of the Holy Spirit when we pray is to convict us of our inner being so that
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.480]   what happens externally is simply a by-product of the ministry of the Holy Spirit inside
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   of us.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.760]   And that's exactly what Paul says in Colossians 1.29.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.280]   For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:50.120]   Not my power, but His power, which mightily works within me.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.800]   Paul's not laboring hard because he's more disciplined than other people.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   He's more educated.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.120]   He's more determined than others.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.240]   He says the Holy Spirit was working in him.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.880]   Not by his power, but by God's power.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:09.440]   But third and finally, God the Son, Jesus Christ, is the goal of our prayer.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:16.160]   Verse 17, "So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and that you being rooted
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.760]   length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge that
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.960]   you may be filled up to all the fullness of God."
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:35.920]   If you notice here in these three verses how he mentions to the utter nth degree.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.220]   He's not just saying so that you would recognize who Jesus is.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:46.360]   He's not simply saying that so that you could believe in Jesus, so that you can be transformed
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.800]   from a child of the devil to child of God.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.240]   He doesn't say that.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.020]   It's way beyond that.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.320]   To make Christ dwell in your heart.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:02.880]   The word for dwell here is not simply talking about a guest that's coming to your house.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   The dwell here is to make a home.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.420]   To make a home.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:13.040]   You know, whenever we invite guests to our houses, we have to go clean up everything.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   Right?
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.080]   Except our closet in our main bedroom.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.320]   You're not allowed to go there.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.860]   So there's parts of the house you can go to, parts that you cannot.
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.760]   Wherever they come, we clean up.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:30.120]   But if they come live with us, just simple cleaning is not going to do.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.480]   You have to prepare.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.920]   Or they're going to see how you really are before you prepare.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.960]   So many people are reluctant to invite Christ into their home.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.280]   They bring Christ into their home as a guest.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.720]   As welcomed on Sunday, but go back to your house on Monday.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:55.920]   See here he says that Christ may dwell, make a home in your home.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.500]   He's making a permanent dwelling.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.280]   He's living with us.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:07.640]   We can't ask for revival if we don't want Christ to come dwell with us.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.800]   Revival isn't simply feeling passionate, singing louder, and the church is growing, and doing
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.780]   more evangelism.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:20.760]   Revival is to invite the presence of God into our intimate homes.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.360]   Where we dwell Monday through Friday, sorry, Sunday.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.880]   Every single day.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.960]   That's what he means, that he was praying that Christ would make a dwelling in our home
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   and being rooted and grounded in love.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.120]   Rooted, it's not simply talking about a plant that you can move anywhere when something
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.660]   is rooted.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.120]   That it's independently growing.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.340]   It's planted there.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:51.400]   So he's saying to make a dwelling, to make your home, to root it and ground it.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.360]   Again, he's saying the same thing again.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.760]   That Christ would make a permanent home and may be able to comprehend with all the saints,
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.720]   not just that God loves you, but what is the breadth and the length and the height and
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.960]   the depth of the love of Christ.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.360]   Not just to say, you know what, I appreciate what Jesus has done and we participate in
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.520]   communion, we sing some songs.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.480]   He said no.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:21.680]   You understand the depth, the height, the width, and the length of the love of Christ?
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:27.080]   And it's not just grace, it's just lavish grace that he bestowed upon us.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:34.200]   And then he says, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:40.120]   Beyond what I can just tell you, it surpasses knowledge.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.440]   Corrie Tamboon, many of you guys know who she is.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.160]   She survived the Holocaust, became a Christian, became an evangelist.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.520]   And I remember hearing her testimony saying how she needed to sell watches in order to
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.520]   make a living.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.880]   And she would say every time she would sell a watch to a person, and she would walk away
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.920]   feeling somewhat guilty because she'd think, what if the watch breaks down?
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.560]   What if it doesn't live up to the hype?
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:09.760]   And she always came away from the sale thinking that maybe I hyped it up too much.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.900]   And then she became an evangelist, sharing the gospel and the love of Christ to people.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.220]   And she'd say, after she would preach the gospel and share about the richness of Christ,
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.340]   she would walk away thinking, did I do him justice?
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:28.340]   That no matter how hard she worked to explain the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, she
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:34.220]   always came out thinking that maybe I didn't do it justice.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.580]   That's what he means by to comprehend with all the saints the surpassing knowledge of
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:44.460]   Christ, the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:52.140]   How do you embrace and understand the love of Christ that surpasses beyond knowledge?
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.460]   It's not simply something that you can read.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:00.180]   It's not simply from exposition, from hearing a sermon.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:03.060]   It's when we encounter this God.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:09.780]   See, as much as I would say, well, it's a hyperbole, it's an exaggeration, but it's
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:14.500]   a reality when you actually meet Christ.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:22.440]   As much as I want to explain to you and describe to you, nothing will do it justice until you
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.580]   yourself meet Christ.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:30.540]   Some days I might do a good job, some days I might do a bad job, but no matter how good
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:37.700]   of a job that I do, you will always leave this room knowing that you meeting Christ
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.860]   isn't going to do justice of anything that I've said.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:48.420]   And so he says in this passage that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled up to all
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:54.740]   the fullness of God, all the fullness of God, not simply to taste Him, not simply to observe
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:03.420]   Him, not simply to praise Him, but the fullness of Him, to consume by Him.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:09.500]   Again, you and I live in a generation that even just going to church and becoming a member
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:16.740]   in a church, going to Bible study every week makes you a serious Christian in our generation.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:21.720]   But that's where the deception lies, because we automatically think because we're doing
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:27.260]   more than the people around us that we're good.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:32.520]   But Paul's prayer and the desire of the Holy Spirit groaning inside of us, interceding
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:38.780]   on our behalf is so that we may become fanatics of Christ.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.220]   Where the world looks at us and say, "Man, these people are strange.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.860]   They're weird."
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:51.540]   In fact, the previous generation, they would call people who are on fire for Christ, "Jesus
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.540]   Christ."
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:57.300]   And for those who are passionately pursuing Christ as a compliment, I must have been doing
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.420]   something right because they see that I'm weird.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:09.980]   But for whatever reason, our generation has become a derogatory term even in the church.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   We want to love Jesus.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.540]   We want to follow Jesus, but we don't want to be freaks.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:20.540]   But that's exactly what he was praying for, that we would be infatuated with Christ.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:28.100]   And the reason why he wants us to be infatuated with Christ is because that's where life is.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:34.580]   Everything else that draws us away from God, that hinders us from God, is going to drain
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.120]   that life away from us.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.340]   So to be infatuated with Christ is to be infatuated with life.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:47.740]   To be infatuated with Christ is to be infatuated with hope.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:54.420]   Not just to casually follow him, but to have him with all our might.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:44:00.940]   And that word here, "to comprehend," to comprehend this love, is not simply mental understanding.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.060]   Because in John 1, verse 5, it says, "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.740]   did not comprehend it."
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.820]   He's not talking about comprehending like it didn't make sense to them.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:14.880]   The word "comprehend" means to go toward and to attain, to strive after.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:18.300]   And that's what he means in 1 Corinthians 9, 24, "Do you not know that those who run
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.060]   in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:26.380]   Run in such a way that you may win."
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.380]   To win.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.220]   Not just to say, you know, I got a number.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:34.140]   You know, I could sign up for a marathon.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:40.340]   It'd be a big joke, because no one's ever seen me run.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.700]   I could sign up for the marathon, because I just need to pay.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.640]   And they're going to give me a number.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:52.580]   And I put the number on, just casually, and I could tell you that I'm in the race.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.080]   But the difference is, I don't care if I win.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:02.680]   So whether it takes me two hours or 14 days, it doesn't matter.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.680]   So if I'm not trying to win, it doesn't matter what kind of shoes I wear.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.740]   It doesn't matter what kind of pants I wear.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.560]   It doesn't matter if anything's hindering me, because hindering me from what?
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.640]   Nothing's hindering me from being in the race.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.880]   It is hindering me from winning the race.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   And that's the difference.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.280]   He's not just simply calling us to sign up for the race.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.480]   He's calling us to win.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.280]   To have the fullness of Christ.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   All of it.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:34.440]   He didn't just give us life so that you can taste the goodness of God.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.680]   He wants us to come to His banqueting table.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:42.600]   That's what Paul in Philippians 3, 2, 12 says, "Not that I have already obtained it,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:48.960]   or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.720]   I also was laid hold of by Christ Jesus."
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.240]   In other words, the whole reason why Christ took hold of me is so that I can take hold
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.160]   of Him.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.640]   As much as He lavished His love upon me, that I could comprehend this with all the other
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:10.080]   saints and then to strive after Him with all my might so that I may be consumed with Christ.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.160]   Infatuated with Christ.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.960]   I want to know everything about Christ.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.320]   I want to know Him in the morning.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.640]   I want to know Him in the afternoon.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.400]   I want His name to be ringing in my head when I go to sleep.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.000]   I want Him to be my refuge.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.840]   I want Him to be the source of my joy.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.680]   I want Him to be the one that I'm waiting for.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.320]   I want to eagerly wait to die so that I can meet Him face to face.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:48.840]   To be infatuated with the fullness of Christ that you cannot have anywhere else but with Him.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.120]   This is why we need to pray.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.560]   This is why we need to come and meet Him.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.560]   You can talk about how great He is.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:07.000]   You can describe the riches of Him, but until you meet Him yourself, it's not the same.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.360]   Reading a book about somebody and meeting Him is not the same.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.760]   That's why He concludes with His benediction in verse 20.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.280]   He says, "Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.080]   think according to the power that works within me.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.440]   To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all the generation forever and ever.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:27.960]   Amen."
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:36.640]   Far beyond what you and I could possibly imagine, He says to come.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:44.520]   Imagine if I told you that each one of us has access to nuclear power.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.200]   The first thing that would happen is a sense of fear.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.960]   Because if you handle this wrong, you're going to die.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:58.480]   But the second thought that you may have is if I have this access to this nuclear power,
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.960]   what would you do with this power?
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:08.760]   Next time I go camping, I don't have to worry about electricity because I have nuclear power.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:14.160]   You don't ever have to worry about your phone dying because you got nuclear power.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.160]   You don't have to worry about electricity bill at home because you have nuclear power.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   I mean, solar, I mean, it's a joke.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.760]   You got nuclear power.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:30.360]   But how trivial would it be if that's all you thought?
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:36.480]   How we would miss the point if that's all the application you can think of?
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.960]   If I had nuclear power, wouldn't you think because of the magnitude of this power, there
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:47.880]   are nations, people who are starving, whose countries don't have electricity, where you
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:56.000]   can almost wipe out poverty if you can give them access to this power.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.720]   We wouldn't simply think of camping and heating and our phones.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:13.840]   And yet, so much of our prayer is about protection when we travel, to become healthy if we get
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:23.400]   sick, to find a good job when economically we struggle, to have better relationships.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:29.000]   How much of our prayer and our concerns are wrapped up in trivial things?
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.720]   Not that God doesn't care, he said he counts every hair on our head, but if that's all
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.640]   we're concerned about.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:45.120]   In Psalm 2-8, it says, "Ask of me and I will surely give you nations as your inheritance
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:50.560]   and the very ends of the earth as your possession."
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:55.660]   That prayer and that invitation is appropriate and it is fitting for the one who is calling
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.380]   us to pray.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:05.200]   Even nuclear power is trivial in light of who it is that we have access to.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:11.640]   And so every time we see Apostle Paul praying, he doesn't pray for health.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.960]   He's a human being like us, he's concerned like anybody else, he wants to avoid pain
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.440]   like anybody else.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:23.800]   He's in prison praying for the salvation of the guards.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.720]   He's concerned about the churches outside, asking, telling them, "I have found the secret
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.820]   of being content in every and all situation."
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:37.220]   He is praying that whether he is in chains or whether he is outside, his greatest concern
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:42.020]   is that the nations would come to Christ.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:47.420]   He understood what he had and that's why his prayers reflected it.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.760]   He prayed for nations.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:55.140]   I want to end this sermon with a confession.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:51:00.700]   Our church has been growing faster than ever before.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.780]   And so the common concern that I hear from members who have been at our church for a
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:11.100]   while, especially even with our pastoral staff, is how are we going to handle this?
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.620]   Do we have enough building?
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.180]   I mean, thank God that we are able to purchase that building, we have some more space and
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:20.460]   it's like, well, the space in which we're growing, we're going to have to need that
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.140]   building and then say, well, once we get that, is that going to be enough?
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.460]   And what are we going to do if we double and triple in size?
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.420]   And do we have enough pastoral staff?
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.020]   Do we have enough small group leaders?
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.420]   Do we have enough space?
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:38.460]   You know, there's wrestling with that and praying about that and thinking, how trivial
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:48.100]   my anxiety to come before the God of the universe and say, if he makes it grow, will he provide
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.700]   what's needed for that?
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:55.100]   I've taken my eyes off of him and realizing, just do what I tell you to do.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:00.220]   And if it triples, let God handle whatever is needed for that.
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:04.100]   Let him handle it and trust him.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:09.740]   And I share this with you because that's, I think many of you can relate, that if I
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:14.600]   give my full to him, what if?
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.660]   If I give my all to him, what if?
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:23.540]   If I surrender everything to him, what if?
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:31.580]   And so we pray to an almighty God while we hang on to our bank accounts and all our safety
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:38.860]   nets and make sure all that is in place, because in the back of our mind, maybe we've forgotten
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:45.500]   who he is or our faith is too small.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:50.380]   This Friday, when we come to prayer, I want to encourage you to come to prayer prepared.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:54.780]   You know, typically if you're not careful, you just come neglecting the whole week and
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.660]   say, well, at least Friday I'm going to go pray.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:02.500]   You know, best way to pray corporately is to pray privately.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.780]   Those who pray privately are going to have the best time praying corporately.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.140]   There is a special power in the presence of the gathering of the church.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.820]   That's why we gather, right?
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.540]   And I know some of you are going to be online, but even if you're going to be online, prepare
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.020]   yourself.
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:20.220]   If you have sense to confess, don't wait till Friday, confess it tonight.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.100]   Confess it today.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:28.820]   Prepare yourself to meet the almighty God who is rich in his mercy, who has lavished
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:34.140]   on us everything that we need for a life of godliness to come together.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.140]   Make a list of things to pray for.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.620]   Make a list of things that these are things that I'm going to petition before God and
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:46.340]   to come together to pray, to pray, pray, pray.
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.620]   We have hope.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:56.020]   We have hope in Christ, so it only makes sense that we devote ourselves to pray.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:03.580]   So I hope and pray that this coming year that we would make significant strides toward that
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.660]   direction.
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:12.020]   And I say this because honestly, I haven't led you well in this direction.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:19.300]   I've been pounding about the necessity of the word for so many years, and I have given
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.540]   sermons about prayer.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:28.140]   We've had prayer meetings and the importance of prayer, but honest confession, in comparing
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:33.620]   to how important this is, I don't think I've led you well.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:39.100]   I want you to see what Christ showed me.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:46.060]   I want you to know him, not just to observe him, not just to describe him.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:57.260]   I want you to know Jesus, because I know that if you meet the Christ that I met, if you
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:06.200]   see the Jesus that I saw, you would want to follow him with all your might too.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.940]   You wouldn't be as easily distracted by this world.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:18.060]   You would want to spend all your life to tell other people about Christ.
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.620]   And it's not enough just to study.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:29.860]   We have to humble ourselves before the Lord, seek him with all our heart, together to comprehend
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:35.860]   the richness that we have in Christ, that we may be filled with all things of Christ.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:44.420]   Let's pray.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:51.220]   Heavenly Father, Lord, your mercy and grace is beyond comprehension.
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:56:00.120]   Lord, we thank you for calling us, allowing us to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:12.700]   Christ, but if we've relied on our circumstance, on our previous knowledge, experience, study,
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:21.080]   and yet we feel so distant from you, help us, Lord God, this week, this year, to be
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:29.740]   devoted in prayer, knowing who you are that calls us, to be able to be engaged in the
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:37.020]   power of the Holy Spirit, to sanctify our inner being, that our eyes may be opened,
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:43.980]   Lord God, that true knowledge of Christ is beyond knowledge, the height, the width, the
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:50.420]   depth, and the length of the love of Christ, that we would not simply have the name of
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:56.060]   Christian, that we will be followers with all our might.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.060]   May Christ be exalted.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:00.060]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
