[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   Hebrews chapter 2, verse 14 to 18.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.560]   And I'm going to be focusing on the second part of this text, 16 to 18, this morning.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.840]   "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise also partook
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.160]   of the same, that through death he might render powerless him who had the power of death,
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.320]   that is the devil, and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.760]   all their lives.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.280]   For surely he does not give help to angels, but he gives help to the descendants of Abraham.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.080]   Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things, so that he might become a merciful
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.800]   and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.220]   of the people.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.920]   For since he himself was tempted in that which he has suffered, he is able to come to the
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.800]   aid of those who are tempted."
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.080]   Let's pray.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:02.920]   Gracious Father, we come this morning desiring to worship you, desiring to hear from you.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.000]   We pray that what you have anointed in these words, would judge the thoughts and intent
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.280]   of our own hearts.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.320]   Help us to see clearly, Lord God.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.280]   Help us to understand.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.220]   Help us, Lord God, to desire with all our might to humble ourselves before your throne,
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.400]   that we may be pleasing aroma, pleasing sacrifice in your presence.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.540]   I pray that you will bless this time and all those who have come to be ministered by you
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.540]   in your word.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.220]   That we would have fertile hearts, that your word would land on soil that will produce
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.020]   fruits thirty, sixty, and hundredfold.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.940]   So we entrust this time to you, asking for your help, asking for your blessing.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.960]   Something that I forgot to announce is next Sunday we have a Father's Day celebration.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.180]   And so if you are a father in a church or soon to be a father, or you're going to be
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.020]   bringing a father, next Sunday we're going to be having special lunch for them.
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.380]   And just like for Mother's Day, the mothers and the children will also have pizza, lesser
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.660]   lunch, but there will be lunch for you if you sign up for that.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.660]   And so please sign up.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.660]   If you haven't signed up, we need to know exactly how many people we need to prepare
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.660]   for.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.480]   And so our logistics team is getting this set up.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.140]   So please let them know if you are planning to come next Sunday, or if you plan to bring
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.140]   guests, let them know also.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.120]   And that will take place right after the second service next week.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.420]   Our family actually is practicing or celebrating Father's Day today, because next Sunday,
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.220]   Phillip's family are going to be out of town, and so we decided that we're going to do this.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.460]   And usually on Father's Day, we end up visiting my father's grave, and we usually go there
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.260]   and pay our respects, and then afterwards we'll come back to our house and we'll do
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.340]   – this is what we traditionally do.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.220]   I know most of you guys know, but the older I get, the more I think about my dad.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.980]   And the reason why I think about my dad is because he also was a pastor.
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.580]   And my grandfather was a pastor, he was a pastor, and I'm the third generation pastor.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.980]   But the reason why I think about him more as I get older is because I don't remember
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.940]   my dad that well when he was in his 30s, obviously.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.420]   And I don't – very vaguely I remember him.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.980]   In my 40s – in his 40s, I do remember, but again, I was too young, so I wasn't really
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.380]   paying attention much.
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.320]   But as I creep into my 50s, I have very vivid memories of when my dad was in his 50s.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.740]   He was in the thick of ministry, and my dad was also a reluctant pastor.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.500]   He didn't sign up to be a pastor.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.980]   His dad, my grandfather, thought that he had the best character to be a pastor.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.040]   When I was younger, the reason why I couldn't relate to my dad is because my dad's personality
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.540]   was nothing like me.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.980]   Philip, my younger brother, is more like my dad than I am.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.300]   I'm more like my mom in character.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.260]   Everything has to be done right away.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.260]   That's my mom.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.540]   My dad was exactly the opposite.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.180]   So when I was younger, I admired him, respected him, but there was not a lot of things that
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.860]   I could relate to because we were so different.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.580]   As I get older, knowing that my dad was reluctant, and yet he embraced his role, he had genuine
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.060]   faith, but his ultimate, the real desire was to be a doctor.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.620]   He had the good enough grades, and he wanted to get into med school, but my grandfather
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.580]   told him that you should go into ministry.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.280]   And so my dad submitted to my grandfather, went into ministry, got a seminary degree,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.540]   and then he came to the United States to get his doctorate so that he could become a professor.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.740]   So being a pastor, local church pastor, was not something he wanted.
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.780]   It just happened in the context of pursuing his degree, and while he was pursuing his
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.540]   degree, he decided to pastor some churches, and there are years that I remember he was
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.940]   a pastor of a very large church, and then there were years, many, many years, where
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.580]   it was a very small, struggling church while he was teaching seminary, and this was kind
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.900]   of his background.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.460]   So when I was younger, I couldn't relate to any of that stuff.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.140]   I wasn't a Christian, and I saw a lot of things that was happening in the church, and had
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.520]   a very negative view, but again, I didn't think much about what was happening and his
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.380]   experience as a pastor, but the older I get, I have very vivid memories of him at my age.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.380]   And so every once in a while, I would think, you know, it'd be great, and he passed away
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.340]   about 10 years ago, and every once in a while, I'd think, and again, it's Father's Day,
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.140]   and then his birthday is coming up soon, and so it kind of makes me think, like, wow, you
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.580]   know, it'd be great if he was here.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.860]   I can ask him, or at least hear from him, his perspective and what he experienced.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.400]   I share all of this because though he's not here, I think about, I have memories of him.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.500]   I have memories of him at my age, and it helps me, even though it's not a personal conversation,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.100]   it helps me to think that somebody walked in these shoes before me, and then before
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.880]   him, somebody walked in his shoes.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.740]   And so indirectly, it gives me a great amount of comfort and strength to know that this
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:22.340]   is in our family, that my dad, to me, from a distance, set the path for me to go.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.700]   Again, he was reluctant, I came into ministry reluctant, and so this is, you know, what
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:35.060]   God has given us as a lot in life, and he remained faithful to the day that he died.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.620]   And so it gives me strength to even just think about that.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.620]   The reason why I say all of this is because the text that we're looking at tells us that
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:49.540]   this is Jesus' incarnation, and the primary reason why he did, Jesus did what he did,
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.180]   was to step in our shoes so that he can help us.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.900]   Paul says, Apostle Paul says in his letters, that he has become all things to all men,
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.500]   so that by all means he could save some.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.540]   Those are not original words of Apostle Paul.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.900]   Paul is simply mimicking what happened to him.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.500]   All his life, as a faithful Jew, as a Pharisee, he thought he was serving God, but then when
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:24.100]   he met the risen Christ on the road to Damascus, for three days, he was probably contemplating,
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.300]   that man was God?
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.500]   Why would God come here?
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.780]   Why would he walk among us?
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.460]   And so in those three days when he was blinded and he was contemplating and repenting and
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:45.180]   his world was being flipped upside down, he probably wrestled with the same idea.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.380]   Why did God become man?
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:55.740]   The answer is pretty clear, it's because he loved us.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:02.900]   Our Father in heaven loved us enough to send his only begotten Son, take on human form,
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:08.740]   our frailty, so that he can become a sympathetic high priest.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.340]   Verse 16 says that he wasn't to the angels, but the descendants of Abraham, that he sent
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.740]   his only begotten Son to help.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.540]   This is all connected to the previous chapter where he says that Jesus is greater than the
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.540]   angels.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.500]   He's kind of wrapping up his argument about Jesus being greater than the angels, but as
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.380]   he is wrapping it up, he's not just saying Jesus is greater, not only is Jesus greater,
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.260]   his love for us is greater than the angels.
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.460]   It is to us that he has sent his only begotten Son.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:42.700]   And that's why in 1 Peter 1.12, Peter says, "It was revealed to them, the prophets, that
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.660]   they were not serving themselves, but you in these things in which now have been announced
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.300]   to you through those who preach the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven,
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.820]   things into which angels long to look."
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.020]   You know what that means when the angels were longing to look?
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.500]   They were coveting.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.380]   They were looking at the plan of salvation for you and I, and the prophets were longing
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.740]   to see what is this?
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.260]   Why would the Son of God fulfill this?
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.440]   But even the angels, as they were looking into it, said, "What is this?
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.140]   Why would God do this?"
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.260]   The previous passage that we looked at, the text that we looked at, it gave us the first
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.560]   part of why he came.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.100]   In verse 14, it says, "Since the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.380]   also partook of the same, that through death he might render powerless him who had the
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.540]   power of death."
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.540]   That is the devil.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:41.540]   He tasted death, which he could not do as God.
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.740]   He needed to live a sinless, perfect life, taste death on our behalf, and then conquer
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:52.740]   the power of death for those who proclaim him as Lord and Savior, that we also may be
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.500]   free from this death.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.060]   He said that was the intention of his incarnation.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.180]   The second part of that, in verse 17, he says, "Therefore he had to be made like his brethren
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.500]   in all things, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest."
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.180]   Not only did he taste death to deliver us from the power of death, he became a merciful
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.180]   and faithful high priest.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.980]   And he could not have done that.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.100]   He could not have done that simply as God.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.820]   He had to be a mediator, because a mediator is an individual who is able to mediate between
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.980]   two parties.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:33.260]   If you've ever been in a lawsuit and two parties come together, a mediator, an outside
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.020]   objective mediator is hired to stand in between, that they can understand the arguments of
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.020]   both sides, so that they can mediate and bring them together.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:47.900]   You don't bring somebody from your side, or somebody who's on the other side.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.220]   You bring somebody in the middle who can understand both sides.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:56.020]   So Jesus came as a man, because he already knows who God is.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:01.420]   He's the second person of the Trinity, but in order to represent us and mediate us between
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.300]   us and this holy God, he became man.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:11.860]   But you know, one of the things that we studied this year, about doing an inductive Bible
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.620]   study, we have to ask a lot of questions.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.940]   If you really want to dig and understand, not just kind of skim over it, but you have
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.940]   to ask questions.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.180]   So if you're reading this text, one of the first questions that I hope you would ask
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:32.940]   is, he said he became like us, made like his brethren in all things.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.940]   In all things.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.340]   Don't just skim over that.
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.200]   What does he mean by all things?
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.180]   Many of you are over 33.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.260]   He's only lived to 33.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:50.300]   So if you're 34, Jesus never lived up to 34.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.720]   If you're 40, Jesus never lived up to 40.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:00.460]   If you're a grandparent, he's never been married, he's never had kids, so he's never had grandkids.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.700]   How much of our struggle as parents is raising kids?
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.340]   Jesus never raised kids.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.460]   So how could he know our struggle?
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:14.220]   When he says he was made like us in every way, I mean, that sounds like an exaggeration.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.540]   How often we think like Jesus could not understand.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.140]   I mean, he was a man.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.900]   That's half the congregation in here that isn't a male.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.820]   So what do you mean all things?
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.580]   My struggles as a female is unique.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.860]   He was never a female, so he wouldn't understand.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.100]   Many of us are Asian.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.100]   He wasn't Asian.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.100]   He was Jewish.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.100]   Some of us are Caucasian.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.100]   He wasn't Caucasian either.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.460]   Some of us are Hispanic.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.940]   He wasn't Hispanic.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.900]   He was Jewish.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:53.140]   A Middle Eastern Jewish man from 2,000 years ago who died at the age of 33, who was never
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.660]   married, never had kids.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.780]   How can he possibly understand me?
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.620]   What does he mean that he became like us in every way?
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:10.860]   Well, you have to keep reading that because he qualifies what he means by all things.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.100]   He was made like his brethren in all things so that, okay, that's really important because
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:22.180]   the psaltic basically answers that question, so that he might become a merciful and faithful
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.020]   high priest.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:33.100]   His whole point of incarnation and experiencing humanity is so that he may become a faithful
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.340]   and merciful high priest.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:42.940]   So what he experienced was for the purpose of mediating.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.260]   It's for mediation.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:50.700]   So his humanity wasn't simply so that every single person who suffers and struggles and
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:56.660]   has difficulties in life, that Jesus can come alongside and you can cry on his shoulder.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.160]   Not to say that that doesn't happen.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.420]   Not to say that God doesn't invite us to do that.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:07.860]   But his primary purpose of his humanity, his incarnation, is to mediate between us and
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.860]   God.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.140]   In fact, he explains it even further.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.780]   In the things pertaining to God, he experienced all things.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.660]   To mediate in the things pertaining to God.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.820]   First Timothy 2, 5-6 is that for there is one God and one mediator, also between God
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.380]   and man, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.820]   He doesn't say God.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.860]   He specifies that Jesus is man.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.180]   That the mediation took place.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.380]   The reason why he became a man is so that he could be that mediator.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.260]   And he became the perfect mediator.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.540]   Because nobody can mediate us for God.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.260]   Because God, only God can do that.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.640]   Only God can represent God.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.440]   Every other person would simply be a messenger.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.900]   But Jesus stands between us and God.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.620]   And only man can represent man.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.500]   Jesus lived a sinless, perfect life as a man and to this now he stands as a mediator.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.620]   But we have to understand, we go a little bit further than that.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:18.420]   Because in Hebrews 7, 24-25, Jesus on the other hand, because he continues forever,
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.700]   holds his priesthood permanently.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.540]   Therefore he is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through him since
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.660]   he always lives to make intercession for them.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.780]   You know one of the common questions that people have is how will our eternity be different
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.820]   than the Garden of Eden?
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.100]   Because God made us sinless at the Garden of Eden and yet we fell.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.380]   What's going to guarantee that when we are in eternity that this is going to happen again?
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.700]   And that the cycle of falling and redemption, falling and redemption may happen through
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.700]   eternity?
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.300]   Well the answer is made clear in Hebrews chapter 7.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:16:00.100]   That Jesus the mediator was not one time thing that happened in justification and then it's
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.100]   done.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.100]   He says what?
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.100]   His priesthood is what?
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.100]   Permanent.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.540]   His mediation it says is permanent.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:14.780]   That he stands before us and God interceding for us, how long?
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.600]   For eternity.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.960]   You know what that means?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:26.060]   Whether he comes in glory or whether we go to glory from our death, when we meet Jesus,
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.700]   we're not going to meet the spiritual Jesus.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.940]   We're going to meet the man Jesus.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:38.100]   Then the scripture says that he did not consider equality with God something to be grasped
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.740]   and he became nothing and took on human form.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.180]   That was permanent.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.180]   Well what does it mean?
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.200]   At the end of that he says well because of that he was exalted to glory.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.980]   He was exalted to glory as a man.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.660]   Why would God need to be exalted to glory?
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.100]   That's who he is.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.900]   It's not a description of God who fell and then was raised back up.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.820]   It's a description of the humanity he took on.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.060]   And then because he was humbled, God exalted him as a man and now he sits at the right
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:16.500]   hand of his father mediating, interceding on our behalf for eternity.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.100]   Our justification was not something that happened 2,000 years ago.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.100]   Our justification is not something that happened when you became a Christian, when you raised
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.020]   your hand or accepted Christ.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.540]   The scripture describes our justification as ongoing intercession by Jesus Christ for
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.620]   eternity.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.700]   And that's the difference between our Garden of Eden and our eternity.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:48.980]   So after we die physically and we are in eternity with God, 500 million years later we will
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:54.540]   just as much be in need of Christ as we are today.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.500]   His mediation isn't just when we are in this flesh.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.500]   For eternity he stands as a mediator.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.940]   You understand the depth of what he is saying?
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:09.260]   He didn't just come temporary, took on human form, and then did his job and went back home
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.140]   to his father.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:17.820]   The Bible describes his sacrifice as an eternal sacrifice.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.900]   And he continues to intercede.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.220]   It's not simply when we are done with our flesh, Jesus' job is done, so therefore he
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.380]   is going to just relax in eternity and be worshipped by creation.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:34.260]   The Bible says he will continue to be interceding on our behalf.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.780]   Does that blow your mind?
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.900]   It's not just temporary.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.940]   His sacrifice is eternal.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.940]   He says he did all that.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:52.620]   He experienced humanity in order to become a faithful, merciful high priest in the things
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:58.620]   pertaining to God and then he says to make propitiation for the sins of his people.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:04.780]   The word propitiation basically means that a party has been offended and something has
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:10.260]   to be done to appease the anger of the one who has been offended.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.140]   Christ came, took on human form, lived a sinless life.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.980]   He tasted death on our behalf in order to satisfy the wrath of God.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:25.020]   The primary reason behind his incarnation is our salvation, to appease the wrath of
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.020]   God.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.860]   1 Timothy 1, 15-16, Paul says, "It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that Christ
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:36.020]   Jesus came into the world to save sinners."
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.480]   Apostle Paul wasn't saved because he had the most potential.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.020]   It wasn't because of his Roman citizenship.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.500]   It wasn't because of his status, because he was a Pharisee, that he knew the law better
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.940]   than anybody else.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.500]   Apostle Paul says it's because he was the foremost of sinners.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:57.380]   Before Paul became a Christian, ask any Christian at that time who they thought was the chief
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.380]   sinner.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.220]   Who was the one persecuting Jesus the most?
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.980]   Who hated the Christians more than anybody else?
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.780]   They would have easily chosen Paul because he took the responsibility over Stephen's
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.060]   death.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:16.020]   He was the one who instigated the persecution and wanted to jail, beat, and kill the Christians.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.860]   He got the approval of the leaders of Israel, got an army, chased them down onto Damascus
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:26.340]   until Jesus strikes him over the head, and then he becomes a Christian.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.660]   He said, "He chose me because I was the worst of sinners."
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.900]   People knew how much I hated Jesus.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:40.380]   And the only reason he was chosen is to highlight Jesus' mission for the gospel.
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:48.340]   If he can save him, if Jesus can be merciful to that sinner, he can save me too.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.340]   That's why he was chosen.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.100]   He wasn't the greatest of preachers.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.140]   I'm sure there were other men who had more money than he did.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.300]   He could have chosen somebody who was maybe a part of the royal family.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.100]   I mean, Apostle Paul, yes, he was a Pharisee.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.060]   Yes, he had great education.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.620]   But couldn't Jesus have converted Caesar himself?
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.580]   It wasn't because of his great potential.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.340]   It was because he was a sinner.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:20.940]   And that's why Jesus says in Matthew 9, 6, and Mark 2, and Luke 5, when they brought
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.380]   the paralytic to be healed, Jesus, instead of healing them, healing him, he says, "Your
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.380]   sins are forgiven."
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.500]   They didn't understand the mission of Jesus.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:35.820]   As long as Jesus was healing people, opening the eyes of the blind, healing the lepers,
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.860]   people loved him.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:44.380]   But when he began to speak about forgiving sins, they started getting offended.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:50.140]   When he began to tell these Jews who had believed him, "If you believe in the Son, if you abide
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.340]   in my word, you shall know the truth, truth shall set you free," they got offended.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.100]   What do you mean, "We need to be set free"?
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.020]   They didn't fully understand his mission.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:06.260]   Jesus didn't come to save mankind from slavery.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.300]   Horrendous things were happening under slavery even at that time.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.820]   He didn't come to save women who were being abused by their husband.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.260]   Horrendous things were happening at that time.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.540]   He didn't come to save people from poverty.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.860]   He didn't come to save us from the wickedness of the Roman government.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:30.220]   His primary purpose is to propitiate for our sins.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.540]   That's why he became our mediator.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:39.200]   That's why he says, "When the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.140]   Not freedom from poverty, not freedom from marriage problems, not freedom from relationships,
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.820]   not freedom from economy, not freedom from the government.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:54.540]   When the Son sets you free from your sins, you will be free indeed.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.380]   That's why the beginning of the gospel is not, "Are you hurt and broken?
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.700]   Come to Jesus."
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.700]   Are you in despair?
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.700]   Come to Jesus.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.360]   Do you have a hard time with life?
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   Come to Jesus.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   Do you have marriage problems?
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   Come to Jesus.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.820]   That is not the beginning of the gospel.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.300]   The beginning of the gospel is to bring us to conviction for our own sins.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.380]   Gospels chapter 3, 10-18, "There is none righteous, not even one.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.980]   There is none who understands.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.740]   There is none who seeks for God.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.820]   All have turned aside.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.760]   Together, they have become useless.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.980]   There is none who does good.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.900]   There is not even one.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.300]   Their throat is an open grave.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.060]   With their tongues, they keep deceiving.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.180]   The poison of ass is under their lips.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.620]   Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness?
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.860]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.060]   Destruction and misery are in their path, and the path of peace they have not known.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.860]   There is no fear of God before their eyes."
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.340]   Who is he referring to?
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.940]   The Jews may have thought, "They must be talking about the Romans, because this doesn't sound
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.220]   like a Pharisee.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:04.420]   They must be talking about the Assyrians, or the Babylonians, or the Greeks, or maybe
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.980]   the prostitutes, the tax collectors."
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.980]   But not the Pharisees, not faithful Jews.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.780]   That's exactly who he was referring to.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.220]   In fact, he was referring to all mankind.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.860]   What an offensive thing to say.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:28.180]   Who would want to be a follower of Jesus if this is how Jesus describes the people who
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.940]   are interested in following him?
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:39.820]   Especially in our generation, where we're so concerned about our self-esteem.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:45.460]   Any little discouragement is the greatest sin.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:53.300]   And yet the gospel begins by an indictment, because he didn't come to help us because
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.620]   our life is hard.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:02.100]   He didn't come so that we can lean our heads on his shoulders and cry when things get tough.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.660]   Now all of these things are true.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.260]   God invites us, because he cares about us.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.700]   But the primary reason is to set us free from the bondage of our own sins.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:16.740]   That's why David says in Psalm 51, verse 4, as he is repenting over his sin of what he
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:23.660]   did to Bathsheba and her husband, he says, "Against you and you only I have sinned."
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.860]   How can he say that?
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.400]   He murdered somebody.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.380]   He forcefully took somebody else's wife.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.620]   How can he possibly say, "Only to you have I sinned"?
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.240]   I mean, he sinned, clearly he sinned against Uriah.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.840]   Clearly he sinned against Bathsheba.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.440]   He clearly sinned against their family.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.640]   He sinned against Israel itself.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.860]   He was the king.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.700]   What kind of hypocrisy is this?
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.660]   "Only to you have I sinned."
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.900]   What does he mean by this?
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.700]   He's not excusing himself and saying that he did nothing wrong to them.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.620]   He's not saying that.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.540]   What he is saying is ultimate sin was against God.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.580]   Ultimate sin against God.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:13.980]   That every sin that he commits ultimately is a cosmic rebellion against this holy God
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:19.180]   who created him to reflect his glory.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:25.780]   That's why he says, "To you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight so that
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:34.580]   you are justified when you speak and are blameless when you judge."
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.460]   You see where David is?
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:42.020]   David is exactly where Apostle Paul is trying to get the readers of Romans in Romans 3,
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.020]   10 through 13.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.020]   It's me.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.020]   It's not them.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.020]   It's not the Assyrians.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.020]   It's not the Babylonians.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.020]   It's me.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.020]   I'm a sinner.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.020]   I'm a sinner in need of your grace.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:27:01.060]   Romans chapter 118, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness,
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:08.780]   unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:16.900]   Christ came to mediate us, to protect us against the wrath of God.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:22.740]   If we miss that, if the church becomes anything less than that, all Jesus becomes is a security
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:30.700]   blanket that we run to when we are scared, tired, lonely, or in despair.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.500]   Sometimes God causes us to be in despair so that we can recognize our sin.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:41.020]   Sometimes God causes poverty so that we can recognize what we're truly bound by.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.820]   He will put us in fear.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.740]   He will put us in terror.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:51.780]   He will put us in desperation because God's primary reason why He came is to bring us
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.740]   to God, to mediate us between this holy God and sinful man.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:02.060]   And if the church becomes anything less than that, if we get sidetracked from that, if
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.540]   it becomes a place where we meet our family, raise our children, do some good things, and
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.780]   feed the orphans, and yet we stray from this, you haven't just missed something important.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:17.380]   You've missed everything about what we are about, about why He came.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:23.420]   Verse 18, it says, "He was tempted in that which He suffered."
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.980]   What a strange thing to say.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:34.460]   You know, temptation itself means that you were coveting something, you desired something.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.220]   How can God be tempted?
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.860]   He can't.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.740]   He has everything.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.740]   He made everything.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.100]   He can do everything.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.060]   God does not covet.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:54.380]   He experienced temptation because He took on human form.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:29:00.780]   What a strange, strange thing for Satan to take Jesus up to the temple and say, "If
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:07.060]   you would just bow down to me, I will give you all of this."
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.220]   He created all of that.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:17.380]   I mean, what Satan was showing Jesus was not even 1%, .00001% maybe less than that, than
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.020]   what he did in the universe.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:26.300]   And yet Satan, in his audacity, stupidity, thought possibly that he could tempt Jesus,
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.180]   that if you bow down to me, I will give you this.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.180]   It's because Satan didn't see his deity.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:41.860]   For the first time in Satan's existence, he saw Jesus vulnerable in his humanity.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.340]   Jesus came, took on human flesh.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.140]   He experienced temptation.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.860]   He suffered in order that he may become a merciful and faithful high priest.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:57.580]   Hebrews 5, 8-10, "Although he was a son, he learned obedience."
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:03.380]   He learned obedience from things which he suffered and having been made perfect, meaning
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.780]   his natural purpose of why he came.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.320]   He experienced humanity.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.860]   He became the perfect mediator.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.380]   He became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation and being designated
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.340]   by God as high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.300]   He became the perfect high priest.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:29.980]   That's why he came, to save us from the power of death and to become a permanent, merciful,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:36.020]   faithful high priest who mediates for us for eternity.
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.100]   Jesus became merciful because he suffered and he was tempted.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:45.500]   You know, I found out, this is a survey that went out in 2018.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:52.660]   They said that every year now, there's at least 1.4 million attempts of suicide, 1.4
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.460]   million people per year.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:02.420]   47,173 are actually successful per day.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.620]   Suicide, people who choose to take their own life.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:12.260]   In the last 10 years, the suicide rate in the United States has increased almost 5%.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.940]   It's increasing.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.020]   There's this many people who are broken.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:24.080]   There's this many people who are in despair to the point where they believe ending this
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.220]   life is better.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:31.580]   You know, recently I read an article about this young man who's 16 years old who took
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.580]   his life last year.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.540]   He was a baseball player at Coronado del Mar High School.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.740]   Some of you guys know, it's Mission Viejo.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:44.780]   And he wrote this long letter of why he committed suicide and it made national news.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:49.140]   In his letter, I was combing through what he was writing and it was a common frustration
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.740]   of many teenagers.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.220]   Just the pressure of getting good grades.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.980]   And any little mistake that he makes, he feels this pressure and he said he couldn't take
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.420]   it anymore and he took his life.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:08.500]   And it made national news because his experience, his frustration is very common to many young
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.060]   men and women.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:17.660]   In fact, when you look up the reasons for suicide, it may sound very mundane unless
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.680]   you're in the thick of things right now.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:31.020]   The most common suicide letters are about breakups in relationships, losing of jobs,
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:40.020]   financial problems, academic failure, bullying, and loneliness.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:45.340]   Every single one of us have experienced some of this.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.100]   Many of us probably experienced all of this.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.260]   And these are the reasons why people take their life.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.760]   Now if we're not emotionally attached to any of this and this is not the state of mind
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.540]   that we are in now, we may look at that and say, "Man, taking your life because you broke
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.540]   up?
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.140]   Taking your life because you lost a job?
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.940]   I mean, we've lost jobs.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.580]   Taking your life because you have financial problems?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.620]   We've had financial problems.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:13.300]   We've experienced some form of bullying and academic failure and you took your life for
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.860]   that?"
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.700]   Imagine if we feel that way, what God would think.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.100]   Consider what he has done.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.120]   He created us.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.980]   He separated us from all the other animals.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.160]   He gave us his glory.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:34.320]   He's allowing the sun to stay where it is and everything that was made and sustained
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.620]   for our life, for our life and enjoyment.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:42.180]   And because this didn't go right or that didn't, because I don't know if we're going to pay
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.940]   my next bill, that we take our lives.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:54.500]   And we would expect God to say, "What's wrong with these people?"
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.680]   But that's not what he did.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:03.540]   He took on human form and he walked in our shoes.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.660]   He felt the pain.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.980]   He felt the sorrow.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.980]   He felt the loneliness.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.540]   Hungry.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.820]   Thirsty.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.700]   Longing for his father.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:18.700]   Friendships.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:26.980]   He experienced all of that in order that he may be a merciful high priest.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.180]   That's why he says in 1 Peter 5, 7, "Cast all your anxieties upon him because he cares
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.180]   for you."
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:36.140]   He didn't just hammer and say, "What's wrong with you?"
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:42.940]   He had compassion when he heard our groaning and then he came and he walked among us.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.740]   He was tempted in that which he suffered.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.820]   He learned obedience through his suffering.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:52.220]   And that's why he became a sympathetic high priest that we can relate to.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:35:02.500]   I told you that I felt like I had no channel to communicate with my dad.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.500]   Part of it was language.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.860]   You know, I can speak language, but I can...
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.860]   Not language.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.300]   I can speak Korean, you know, but I can't speak Korean the way I speak English.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.380]   So usually when people hear me speak Korean, like for the first time, they say, "Oh, your
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.380]   Korean is really good."
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.380]   Until we have a deep conversation.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.940]   And then we get deeper.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.140]   We really want to express what I really feel.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.020]   I can't go beyond that because I don't have the vocabulary.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.820]   And so people can tell right away I was raised here, not in Korea, once we get beyond the
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:30.940]   surface.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:37.540]   So I feel for many of you because you're in that situation where your parents aren't good
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:42.260]   in English and you guys aren't good in your parents' mother tongue, so the communication
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.260]   is always limited.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.740]   So I always felt that distance.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.700]   And I never had any kind of animosity.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.700]   That's just what happened.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.820]   I felt bad for them more than me.
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:36:04.920]   But as I get older, without a word being spoken, I understand my dad more than ever.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.340]   And I know he would understand me because he was in my shoes all his life.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:18.240]   And I find comfort and strength to know that he was in my shoes and I'm going in his shoes.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:26.740]   How much more to know the God who counts the hair on your head, who created you, who loved
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:32.620]   you, experience what we experienced when you and I was deserving of death.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.280]   He wasn't disgusted by us.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.840]   He came toward us.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:44.960]   How much more should we draw near to our Father's throne with confidence?
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.480]   But not only was he merciful, he said he was faithful.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.340]   And that's the problem of mankind.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.500]   You may have somebody in your life that is very, very merciful to you.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.400]   Your mom, your dad.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:01.080]   You may have a really close friend who no matter what you do, you can rely on them.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.960]   You've done horrendous things, said horrendous things, but they forgave you and they've been
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   merciful to you.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   Usually it's our parents.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.640]   You know, most people won't put up with our sins to that degree.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.000]   But no matter how merciful they have been to you, they have limitations to their faithfulness
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.120]   because they are also sinners.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.460]   They also have their own problems.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:26.360]   Even with the best of intentions, they will never fully understand you.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.120]   They can never come to you fully.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.800]   Not only was Jesus merciful, he was faithful.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.560]   In Hebrews 4, 15, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:43.400]   but one who has been tempted in every way, in all things, as we are, yet without sin."
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:48.440]   He was merciful and yet he was faithful.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.080]   That's why we can go to him for confidence.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.780]   That's why he became the perfect mediator.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.600]   He represents the holy God in his perfectness.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:04.160]   And he represents frail humanity in his frail humanity.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.380]   How long?
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:11.840]   As long as you and I exist, he will be mediating on our behalf.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.240]   Does that blow your mind?
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:22.920]   I know we knew the love of God and that's why we were attracted to him.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.240]   That's why we praise him.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.280]   That's why we sing to him.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.160]   That's why we study him.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.200]   But when we first come to know the love of God, it's very superficial.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.480]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:41.840]   All of that is true, but spiritual maturity and sanctification is knowing the depth and
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.840]   width and height of the love of Christ.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.880]   And when we begin to understand that we had a very tunnel vision and then the more we
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.120]   studied the Bible and why inductive Bible study is so important, that's a plug for our
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.840]   Philippines Bible study.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.560]   Why this is so important is because the more we intently look upon it, we see the depth
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:07.360]   and the width and the length and height of the love of Christ.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.920]   And that's where sanctification happens.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.640]   The more we are exposed to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we are changed.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:21.680]   Let me read you this song.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.680]   Andrew Peterson.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.560]   It's a Christian song.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.960]   You can't tell it's a Christian song because I'm only going to read the first part and
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.480]   then because he gets to the cross at the end, but I'm just going to read the first part.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   You'll find your way.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:37.080]   And basically it's a song that our father wrote for his growing son, recognizing that
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.360]   at one day he's going to grow up and experience hardship and live in this sinful world.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.400]   And he's writing this song as an advice to his son.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.240]   He says, "When I look at you, boy, I can see the road that lies ahead.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:55.320]   I can see the love and the sorrow, bright fields of joy, dark nights awake in a stormy
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.680]   bed.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.180]   I want to go with you, but I can't follow.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:06.020]   So keep to the old roads, keep to the old roads, and you'll find your way.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:13.800]   Your first kiss, your first crush, the first time you know you're not enough.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.180]   The first time there's no one there to hold you.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:23.340]   The first time you pack it all up and drive alone across America.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.260]   Please remember the words that I told you.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.780]   Keep to the old roads, keep to the old roads, and you'll find your way.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.780]   You'll find your way."
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:39.180]   And you know the part that really gripped me was when he says, "The first time you know
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.140]   you're not enough."
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:47.300]   First time, what he means by that, when the despair is so deep.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.540]   And this pain is so real.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:54.780]   And you have no way to help yourself.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.700]   And the father's looking on that and says, "First time there's no one there to hold you."
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:06.160]   And as a child, the parent, if we could, we would take the pain for them.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.260]   Every single one of you who have small children, taking them to get vaccines or shots, or they've
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.140]   broken their arms, and you see how much they hate to be there.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:20.980]   And they're screaming their heads off because they're screaming in fear and terror.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:27.900]   How many of you parents thought to yourself, "I wish I could take your place."
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.740]   But you couldn't.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.460]   That's what the father is saying.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:37.660]   When you come to your wits end, and you come to realize for the first time you don't have
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.140]   it in yourself.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.740]   And there's nobody there to help you.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.920]   Keep to the old roads.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   Keep to the old roads.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.140]   And you'll find your way.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.780]   You'll find your way.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.960]   The old road he's talking about is the cross.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:02.100]   The old road he's talking about is the path of Christ.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.460]   This is why Jesus came.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.820]   None of us are smart enough.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.260]   None of us are strong enough.
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.260]   None of us are old enough.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.740]   None of us are experienced enough.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:20.620]   We will all experience the fall of mankind one way or another.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:30.020]   But when that happens, and maybe you are in that now, remember why Jesus came.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:34.500]   Before you go to the counselors, before you go to your friends, before you go to your
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:41.460]   leaders, before you go to your church, before you veg on Netflix, before you make your next
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:48.660]   travel plans, before you go to get your next meal, remember why Jesus came.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:56.620]   He tasted death to free us from the bondage of our own sins and to become a sympathetic,
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:01.580]   merciful, faithful high priest on our behalf.
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.740]   Come to Christ.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.380]   Come to Christ.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.540]   This is why he came.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:15.740]   As our worship team leads us, I want to invite you to take some time to pray.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:21.780]   I'm not exactly sure what all of you are going through at this time.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.700]   It comes in waves at times.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.780]   Sometimes it's harder than others.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:36.460]   But as I said, God will allow us to feel certain pains at times in order to highlight the cross.
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:41.820]   If that's you right now, I invite you, don't run to things, don't run to people, come to
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:49.160]   Christ, the mediator, merciful, faithful, sympathetic.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:54.260]   Let's take some time to pray as we come before the Lord and ask him, "Open my eyes, Lord,
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.720]   that I may see you and love you and worship you."
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.060]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship.
