[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:19.300]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.340]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.060]   I wanted to go ahead and read a passage in Psalm 92,
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.260]   reference this first song we're gonna sing,
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.920]   "It is Good to Praise the Lord."
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.760]   Psalm 92, one says, "It is good to give thanks to the Lord
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.140]   "and to sing praises to your name, O Most High,
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.140]   "to declare your loving kindness in the morning
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.380]   "and your faithfulness by night,
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.140]   "with a 10-stringed lute, with the harp,
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.060]   "with resounding music upon the lyre.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:54.060]   "For you, O Lord, have made me glad by what you have done.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.760]   "I will sing for joy at the works of your hands."
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.020]   So as we sing this song,
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.880]   it is truly a joy,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.600]   and it's good to praise the Lord.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.180]   (gentle music)

[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:36.140]   - Good morning, let me get to a few announcements
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:36.980]   before we get started.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.580]   First of all, I think today's the last day
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.060]   for the membership class that's been taking place.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.540]   So a new session is gonna be starting in April.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.460]   So if you know of someone who needs to be taking that class,
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.780]   April, I think it's the first week of April,
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.620]   they're gonna be starting.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.220]   So please contact either Pastor Nate or Pastor Mark,
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.300]   and they'll give you more information about that coming up.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.380]   This week, we're gonna pick back up on our Bible study.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.180]   So whether it's a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.340]   or home group, so that regular Bible study
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.960]   is gonna be starting for that.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.860]   And also our leadership is going on a leadership retreat
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.940]   that's starting today and we'll be back on Wednesday.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.460]   So if anybody is thinking of coming to church before that,
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.980]   like we won't be here until Wednesday,
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.280]   just to give you a heads up.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.780]   But we ask that you would keep us in your prayers.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.500]   We're not going far, but it is a leadership retreat
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.600]   so to take some time to discuss certain things.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.660]   And so if you guys can keep us in your prayer for that.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.380]   Okay, let's take some time to pray for the offering
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.060]   and we'll give you time to give the offering
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.140]   before we get started.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.240]   All right, let's pray.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:43.800]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.960]   that we have to come and worship you.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.540]   Help us, Lord, to give you worship that you truly deserve.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.700]   Open our eyes that we may see your glory
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.060]   in a greater light, Lord God,
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.900]   that we may be transformed from one form of glory
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.220]   to another.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.660]   We ask, Lord, that your grace would be sufficient
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.620]   and that our love for you may continue to increase
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.980]   as we learn more and more about who you are
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.020]   and your faithfulness to us.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.900]   We ask, Lord, as we give our offering,
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.020]   may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100 fold,
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.700]   that more people may come to Christ,
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.840]   more people may hear the gospel.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.480]   And we ask, Lord God, that your glory
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.260]   may be magnified through it.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.660]   We thank you, Lord, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:56.080]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.000]   to Hebrews chapter 11, verses 30 and 31.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.080]   Okay, Hebrews chapter 11, verse 30 and 31.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.160]   So we're going much faster, two verses today.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.320]   So don't worry.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.380]   Okay, chapter 30, chapter 11, verse 30 and 31.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.640]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.920]   By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.260]   after they had been encircled for seven days.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.900]   By faith, Rahab the harlot did not perish
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.880]   along with those who were disobedient
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.520]   after she had welcomed the spies in peace.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.360]   Let's pray.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:39.140]   Heavenly Father, we pray for greater insight,
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:44.720]   greater knowledge of Christ and what he has done,
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.320]   that all that we do may simply be a reasonable response
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.560]   to your great mercy.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.880]   Lord, as we continue to study your redemptive history
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.680]   and the examples that have gone before us,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.100]   help us, Lord God, not to simply take it as knowledge,
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:05.000]   but the source of strength for application in our lives,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.960]   to put our confidence and trust in you and you alone.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.760]   So we pray for your grace and your Holy Spirit
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.200]   to lead and guide us through your word.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.100]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.760]   All right, so now we're jumping into
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.600]   the next great event that took place.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.720]   40 years have gone by since they've come out of Egypt,
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.080]   and so we're skipping literally from Exodus 14, 15,
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.440]   and we're just speeding through Exodus,
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.160]   Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.400]   and then now we're at the event that takes place in Joshua.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.680]   And so, but before we jump into this text
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.240]   in verse 30 and 31, I wanted to remind us
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.000]   of how we got to chapter 11,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.220]   so that we can understand this in the proper context, okay?
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.640]   So if you remember, the whole book of Hebrews
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.200]   is written to a group of people
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.960]   who have been drifting from their faith.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.560]   So they've been tempted,
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.200]   in the very beginning of their faith,
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.560]   they were celebrating their love for Christ,
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.040]   and they were fellowshipping with those
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.560]   who were being imprisoned,
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.600]   and so it was a very strong church,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.820]   but at some point, maybe after 10, 20, 30 years,
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.680]   persecution was intensified,
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.260]   and so many of them started drifting back to their old life,
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.060]   to the Judaistic life,
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.740]   and so the remedy for that, for the author,
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.800]   is to remind them of the supremacy of Christ.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.240]   So we had chapter 10, 10 chapters,
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.300]   of talking about how Jesus Christ
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.740]   is better than everything that they value.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.420]   He's better than the angels, better than Moses,
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.660]   better than the prophets, better than the priests,
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.940]   and he's a greater sacrifice.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.140]   So that's what he's been talking about.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.180]   He's been laying out Christology
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.800]   to demonstrate to them that this great salvation
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.820]   that we have in Christ,
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.140]   that if we neglect such a great salvation,
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.100]   how much more deserving of judgment would we have?
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.960]   So we had 11 chapters, or 10 chapters of Christology.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.700]   When we get to chapter 12 and chapter 13,
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.740]   it's the application of those 10 chapters.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:07.380]   If we truly believe that Christ is supreme
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.300]   over everything else, then this is how we ought to live.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.340]   So chapter 12 and chapter 13,
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.760]   there's a lot of imperatives teaching us instructions
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.180]   on what we ought to do.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.720]   Chapter 11 is right in the middle
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.420]   where he's transitioning from the indicatives
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.460]   to the imperatives, where he's teaching us,
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.980]   this is who Jesus is, and if he truly is supreme
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.260]   over everything that we value,
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.560]   then we ought to live this way.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.500]   And so chapter 11 is, he's saying,
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.100]   but that gap is because of faith, by faith.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.420]   So everything that we've been talking about in chapter 11,
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.220]   that if you believe this, chapter one through 10,
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.540]   then you will do this.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.500]   And here's some examples of some people
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.860]   who by faith have done this, by faith have done that.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.100]   So it's important for us to recognize
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.120]   that I think every one of us have a tendency.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.740]   Some of us are more prone to action,
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.200]   and so we don't have a lot of patience
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.780]   for the theological aspect.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.020]   We just wanna, teach me the basics
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.480]   and then tell me what to do.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.300]   I wanna get to work.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.560]   I wanna do something practical.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.860]   So we kinda leave our theology at a kinda superficial
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.900]   or at a basic level, and then we wanna get to work.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.460]   Or we may have a tendency to be on the other end,
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.420]   where we're so into, like, we wanna know biblical theology,
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.140]   we wanna know all the systematic theology,
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.140]   we wanna know exegesis, and then when it comes
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.900]   to the application, we don't pay as much attention to that.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.420]   Well, chapter 11 really is the core of our Christian faith,
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.720]   where it's not one or the other.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.400]   Both part is just as crucial.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.500]   It's by faith, it's what we believe,
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.220]   not just the superficial, fundamental,
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.180]   Jesus loves you, died for you, was resurrected,
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.240]   so now let's get to work.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.260]   By faith reminds us that everything that he says
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.340]   in 11 chapters, 10 chapters, is just as crucial
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.820]   as what we do, because that's the foundation,
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.060]   that's the motivation, that's the strength,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.860]   that's the reason why we do what we do.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.380]   If you're running and doing something
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.780]   and you forget why you're doing that,
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.140]   eventually you're gonna get burned out.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.340]   So it's by faith, faith is the fuel,
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.120]   the action that they took is because
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.020]   they had the right faith.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.740]   So again, I wanted to revisit that before we jump into this,
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.880]   'cause we wanna ask the question,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.540]   what are we to learn from this?
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.100]   And obviously we have the same theme
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.060]   that's kinda going through all of it is,
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.820]   that this is God's redemptive history,
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.860]   he's being faithful to his promise,
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.800]   and through the ups and downs of Israel's history,
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.600]   that God remains faithful throughout the whole thing.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.820]   There's two questions that we wanna answer here.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.420]   First of it is in verse 30, when it says,
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.100]   "By faith the walls of Jericho fell down
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.800]   "after they had been encircled for seven days,"
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.000]   how come Joshua's name is not mentioned here?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.580]   I mean, he's the central figure in what's going on here.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.940]   So up to this point, we've had,
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.540]   by faith, you know, by faith Abraham did this,
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.080]   by faith Jacob did this, by faith Isaac did this,
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.140]   by faith Joseph did this.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.220]   But when we come to the falling of the wall of Jericho,
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.500]   Joshua's the central figure in this,
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.340]   and his name is not mentioned.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.740]   We get to verse 31, and it says,
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.040]   "By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.620]   "along with those who were disobedient
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:28.620]   "after she had welcomed the spies in peace."
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.580]   Why is Rahab's name mentioned here, right?
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.140]   This great event that takes place through Joshua,
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.100]   this man of faith, and his name is not mentioned,
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.800]   and the person that is highlighted
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.460]   in the conquering of Jericho is Rahab the harlot, right?
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.000]   Why is her name here?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.200]   So the two questions, okay?
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.940]   Why is Joshua's name not here,
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.740]   and why is Rahab's name not here?
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.060]   And again, whenever we do inductive Bible study,
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.260]   it's very important to ask a lot of questions,
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.240]   because if you don't ask questions,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.180]   you won't know when you get the answer, okay?
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.320]   So people who ask a lot of questions
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.380]   are usually the ones who end up learning.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.220]   If you come in and I have no questions,
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.600]   it just means even when something profound comes up,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.640]   you're not really gonna catch it,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.460]   'cause you didn't really search, right?
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.200]   And so again, you get in a habit
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.560]   when we are studying the scripture
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.900]   to ask a lot of questions.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.260]   And so again, that's not the,
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.380]   what we're saying about Joshua's name and Rahab's name
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.220]   is not the central thing that we're gonna be talking about,
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.800]   but it is going to help us to see
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.040]   why it is written in this way, okay?
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.460]   Before we get into it,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.060]   I think we need to understand the background context behind,
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.820]   before they go into Jericho, what exactly happened, right?
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.740]   For 40 years, they come out,
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.260]   and that history of 40 years,
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.340]   there's a lot of things that happened
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.580]   during those 40 years.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.520]   Remember, they got the law, they built the tabernacle,
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.100]   spies went and they came back and they were afraid,
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.340]   and as a result, they wandered in the desert for 40 years.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.420]   And so Moses was a leader during those 40 years, right?
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.220]   Reluctant leader, but he was a good leader.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.800]   And, but right before they are about to face
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.340]   their biggest challenge, up to now, for 40 years,
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.900]   all they had to do was when God said to move, you move.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.820]   God said to sit down, you sit down.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.060]   He said, you touch this, then you touch,
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.500]   God says, don't touch it, you don't touch it.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.420]   He just had to do exactly what he had,
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.080]   he, God told him to do.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.200]   But they were wandering in the desert.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.700]   So it wasn't like there was some, you know,
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.500]   enemies waiting to ambush them every corner.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.940]   But this was the real test.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.660]   The first time they needed to go against a fortified city,
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.900]   God takes Moses out, this great leader out,
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.700]   and he puts this inexperienced leader, Joshua,
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.240]   to lead this charge.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.420]   So if you are a military commander,
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.560]   you say, well, that's a bad time to do this.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.660]   God didn't, in fact, when God removed Moses,
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.980]   like, again, to this day, I'm not exactly sure
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.180]   what Moses did, other than God says,
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.040]   you didn't show me as holy.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.820]   So I've combed through that passage,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.900]   I've heard sermons, read through commentaries,
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.280]   and to be honest, I don't really understand,
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.260]   other than he hit the rock.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:15.720]   And I've heard whole sermons and exposition
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.340]   about what that hitting the rock meant
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.700]   and why he shouldn't have done that.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.640]   It's like, I'm not convinced.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.960]   I don't know exactly what he did,
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.220]   but what God said was, whatever it was,
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.620]   he didn't present God the way God wanted to be presented.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.160]   He misrepresented God to Israel.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.400]   And as a result of that,
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.340]   he couldn't get into the Promised Land.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.380]   So Moses actually is begging God,
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.700]   like, please, look at that land filled with milk and honey.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.020]   I've been waiting 40 years.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.300]   I told you I didn't wanna do this,
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.720]   but here's the payoff, but he couldn't get in.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.980]   So there was no transitional time
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.180]   for Joshua to learn the trades
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:57.060]   and Moses to disciple him and raise him up as a leader.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.420]   There was none of that.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.420]   You switch him out, Joshua gets plugged in,
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.220]   and then they cross the Jordan River,
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.780]   and in order to get to the Promised Land,
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.060]   they face their biggest challenge.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.540]   Here's this fortified city,
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.540]   and in fact, this is how God describes
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.980]   to the nation of Israel who they're up against.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.340]   Deuteronomy 9, one through seven.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.260]   "Hear, O Israel, you are crossing over the Jordan today
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.220]   to go into a dispensation of nations
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.940]   greater and mightier than you."
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.020]   They're all greater and mightier than you, right?
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.940]   It's a great pep talk.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.020]   "Great cities fortified to heaven,
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.100]   a people great and tall, sons of Anakim,
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.660]   whom you know and of whom you have heard it said,
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.340]   who can stand before the sons of Anak?"
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.900]   I mean, I don't think God even needed to remind them.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.280]   They knew what they were up against,
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.660]   but God made it sure that they understood, right?
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.780]   You're going against a fortified city.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.780]   They have a reputation of being great.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.700]   They're bigger than you, right?
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.820]   They're taller than you.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.820]   You know, the only thing I don't mention
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.860]   is they're better looking than you, right?
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.100]   It's almost kind of like
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.380]   he's deliberately trying to discourage them,
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:14.060]   and you have to remember the experienced adults
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.540]   among the Israelites, what happened to them?
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.840]   They all died out, right?
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.160]   So not only do they have a young commanding leader
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.040]   who doesn't have experience,
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.720]   anybody who's older and more mature already died out.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.080]   So it's all the kids from that generation,
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.120]   brand new, are going into the city,
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.240]   and then right before they go, God says,
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.960]   "They're better than you.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.920]   They're stronger than you."
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   You know, and they've been wandering out in the desert.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.320]   These guys aren't trained soldiers.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.840]   All they know how to do is march.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.480]   They know how to carry that box.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.300]   They're good at carrying that box, right?
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.120]   God tells you to sit, you sit.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.020]   He tells you to get up, you get up.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:54.860]   That's what they've been doing,
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.800]   basic training for 40 years.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.840]   So it's kind of like getting a bunch of soldiers
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.080]   who've been doing basic training,
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.920]   and then the biggest battle, right?
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.580]   And then they give a brand new commander,
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.620]   it's like, "Go!
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.560]   By the way, they have better weapons than you."
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.700]   They have a reputation of this army.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.820]   They've destroyed everybody else before you, right?
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.260]   Why is he saying that?
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.020]   Well, he says in verse three, Deuteronomy 9, three,
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.620]   "Know therefore today that it is the Lord your God
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:29.220]   who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire."
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.460]   In other words, if you're going in there
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.920]   with any kind of self-confidence, right,
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.540]   by human standards, they'll destroy you.
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.700]   And that's why I want to let you know it is not you.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.900]   I'm not sending you in.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.780]   I'm going in.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.300]   I just want you to follow me.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.260]   "The Lord your God who is crossing over before you
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.500]   as a consuming fire, he will destroy them,
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.500]   and he will subdue them before you
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.200]   so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly,
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.580]   just as the Lord has spoken to you."
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.140]   And then he goes on even further in verse four.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.660]   And I want you to see how many times he says to them,
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.460]   "Remember that it is not because of your righteousness
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:09.300]   that this is happening."
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.420]   Verse four, "Do not say in your heart
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.980]   when the Lord your God has driven them out before you
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.380]   because of my righteousness,
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.260]   the Lord has brought me to possess this land.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.180]   But it is because of the weakness of the nations
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.620]   that the Lord is possessing them before you.
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.260]   It is not your righteousness
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.260]   for your uprightness of your heart
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.040]   that you are going to possess this land.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.500]   But it is because of the weakness of these nations,
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.620]   the Lord your God is driving them out before you
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.440]   in order to confirm the oath
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.020]   which the Lord spoke to your fathers,
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.060]   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.660]   Know then it is not because of your righteousness
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.420]   that the Lord your God giving you this good land to possess
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.700]   for you are a stubborn people."
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.260]   You kind of get the idea that maybe God was concerned
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.180]   that they're gonna become proud, right?
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.820]   That they're gonna have such an easy time
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.200]   conquering this fortified city
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.040]   that at the end of that,
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.260]   they're gonna come out thinking like,
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.060]   "We must have done something right, right?
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.540]   Maybe it's because all this marching
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.640]   strengthened their legs."
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.220]   You know, "It must have been something," he said.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.840]   But he wanted to make sure.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.340]   And the reason why he wanted to make sure
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.900]   is because our tendency to become proud
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.240]   when things go well.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.540]   And that was their fault.
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:23.780]   When they were the strongest
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.540]   was when they were completely dependent upon God, right?
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.660]   How could they have possibly thought
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.540]   that they came out of Egypt by their own strength?
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.700]   How can they have possibly thought
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.860]   they would have survived in the desert?
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.660]   The water and the food that they ate was miraculous food.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.380]   Normal people would have just died within months
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.940]   with no food, no water.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.420]   God was providing for them.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.640]   But just in case you forgot,
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.900]   I'm not sending you into this city to conquer them
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.920]   because I've done enough training
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.380]   and we have a bunch of trained people
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.060]   who are able to fight.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.020]   And we strengthened you,
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.620]   we worked on your arms and your legs,
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.780]   we worked on strategy.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.900]   And so when we get over there,
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.700]   that we're gonna put all that to use.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.020]   He said, "No, they're bigger than you,
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.440]   they're stronger than you, they're mightier than you.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.900]   So make sure when you get over there
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.940]   that you realize I'm going over and you follow me.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.260]   And just in case after it's done,
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.780]   it is not because of your righteousness.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.500]   Not only are they greater than you,
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.900]   you're not righteous."
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.580]   He goes even further than that, verse seven.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.180]   "Remember, do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.900]   to wrath in the wilderness.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.260]   From the day that you left the land of Egypt
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.660]   until you arrived at this place,
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.820]   you have been rebellious against the Lord."
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.260]   He says, if you have any confidence thinking like,
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.500]   oh, there are no 40 years,
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.300]   maybe that's, you know, we've been good
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.780]   and that's why God is giving us this land.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.820]   He said, "You forgot already what the 40 years was like?"
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.020]   Right?
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.260]   Remember the 40 years, right off,
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.100]   right before they even crossed the Red Sea, right?
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.660]   They started grumbling.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.100]   "You brought us out here to kill us here,
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.380]   it would have been better to go to Egypt."
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.860]   They crossed to the other side
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.100]   and they get a little thirsty.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.940]   "You brought us out here where there's no water?"
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.140]   Then a little bit later, they get hungry.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.300]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, you brought us out here
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.140]   with no food?"
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.540]   God gives them miraculous manna from heaven
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.460]   and it's like, "Oh my gosh, you brought us out here
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:23.180]   to eat the same bread over and over?"
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.900]   So God gives them quail and they eat the quail.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.420]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, the same thing over and over again?"
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.580]   If there's anything in 40 years,
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.060]   remember how many times you provoked the Lord.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.980]   So just in case that you think
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.060]   that somehow you deserve this,
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.220]   it's not because of your righteousness,
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.220]   it's not because of your strength,
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.940]   it's not because they're weaker than you,
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.020]   it's because I'm going ahead.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:54.460]   He said, "Because the promise I made to your forefathers."
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.820]   He's being faithful to himself.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.060]   The covenant that he has made, he is keeping it.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.300]   He says again in Deuteronomy 7, 7-9,
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.300]   "The Lord did not set his love on you,
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.340]   nor chose you, because you were more in number
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.140]   than any of the people.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.020]   For you were the fewest of all the peoples,
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.660]   but because the Lord loved you and kept the oath
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.900]   which he swore to the forefathers,
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.860]   the Lord brought you out by a mighty hand
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.580]   and redeemed you from the house of slavery,
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.380]   from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.180]   Know therefore that the Lord your God, he is God,
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.020]   the faithful God who keeps his covenant
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.180]   and his loving kindness to the thousands generation
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:35.020]   and to those with those who love him
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.100]   and keep his commandments."
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.100]   You know, the mystery of our salvation
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:46.100]   isn't that somehow God has seen a diamond in the rough.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.100]   Every once in a while I hear somebody saying that.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.980]   There's something in us that God saw
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.420]   that maybe even we didn't see,
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.740]   and therefore he chose, right?
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.780]   The diamond in the rough, and he polished us,
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.380]   and he made us his great people.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.520]   Which means that the non-Christians
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.820]   were not worth saving
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.500]   because there was something special about us.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.540]   It's us that God saw.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.420]   And he says, "No."
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.420]   The fundamental question is that he just chose to love us.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.460]   It's not because of your righteousness.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:19.640]   In fact, if you're honest with yourself, right?
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.860]   If you're honest with yourself,
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.260]   we're not even talking about before you became a Christian.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.700]   We're talking about after you became a Christian.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.800]   Do you really think you've lived up to the calling
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.100]   of what God has given you?
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:40.060]   Don't answer that 'cause I don't wanna refute you, right?
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:44.220]   How many of you, including myself,
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.460]   after we've been a Christian,
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.300]   whether you've been a Christian a year,
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.980]   or 30 years, or 40 years, or 50 years,
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.340]   look back on those 30, 40, 50 years of our Christian life
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.860]   and say, "You know what?
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.500]   "I know I was an unfaithful person, you know,
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.140]   "didn't know God,
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.960]   "but after I became a Christian,
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.540]   "majority of my life was lived in obedience.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.960]   "Majority of my thoughts, my human relationships,
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.820]   "was faithful.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.520]   "I lived up to the gospel that the Bible talks.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.560]   "I've loved up to the calling that God has given me."
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.960]   Right?
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.000]   How many of you can confidently say that?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.240]   Right?
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.320]   My guess is if you're honest with yourself,
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.480]   you have memories year after year after year
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.640]   of struggling with certain sins,
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.800]   with anger, bitterness, maybe pride.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.000]   All these things that we can think of,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.640]   and we probably feel more unworthy today
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.680]   than we did when we first met Christ.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:48.440]   The fundamental questions of the gospel isn't,
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.280]   "Why did God punish the sinners?"
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:57.760]   That answer is pretty easy, right?
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.360]   Because they rebelled against him, he's God.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.600]   Why wouldn't he punish them?
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.380]   If somebody irritates you, do you not punish them?
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.240]   Somebody slaps you, do you not slap them back,
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.920]   or at least that's your temptation, right?
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.520]   So we know why rebellious people get punished.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.120]   The question is, why did he love us?
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.840]   So when Jesus comes, I don't think the first question
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.600]   that we should be asking is, "Why did you create hell?
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.740]   "Why is there so much suffering in the world?"
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.120]   The answer is clear, because mankind, all have sinned
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.520]   and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.440]   But the question that remains a mystery,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.080]   and I'm not sure exactly if it's gonna make sense
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.240]   even after we die, when we meet Christ, is,
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   "Why did you choose us?
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.980]   "Why were we chosen?
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.160]   "What did we do?"
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.440]   There really isn't a clear answer,
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.760]   other than the fact he said he chose you,
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.000]   and he chose to love you,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.840]   and he's being faithful to his covenant promise.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.900]   See, he wanted Israel to make sure that they believe,
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:02.740]   because the moment we stray from that,
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.940]   and we begin to think to ourselves,
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.300]   that maybe I was bad before,
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.700]   but maybe if I'm good afterwards,
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.860]   and that's the difference between a good Christian
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.820]   and a bad Christian, or somebody who bears fruit,
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.420]   somebody who doesn't bear fruit,
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.860]   is somebody who works hard
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.760]   versus somebody who doesn't work hard.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.820]   Don't get me wrong, does the Bible tell us
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.660]   to pick up the cross?
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.480]   Yes.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.820]   Does the Bible tell us to pick up the cross?
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:24.660]   Yes.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.260]   Does the Bible tell us, like Paul said,
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.060]   I buffet my body and make it my slave,
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.220]   after I preach to others that I may be disqualified?
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.660]   Yes.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.300]   Does the Bible tell us to sacrifice?
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.820]   Yes.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.700]   All those things are true,
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.980]   but the fundamental place where the gospel brings us,
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.600]   always, past, present, and future,
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.940]   is absolute helplessness before God.
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.060]   'Cause our battle is not against flesh and blood.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.300]   You can't get into a demonic wrestling match
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.980]   by working hard.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:03.340]   You can't change the Spirit's work
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:07.020]   by being smart, by being determined.
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:11.220]   Remember the Corinthians?
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:15.940]   There's a church that really was battling each other
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.540]   for righteousness.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.020]   And so the church started splitting
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:19.900]   because they said, you know,
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.220]   in order to be really righteous and right with God,
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.100]   you need to have the right leader.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.780]   So some were saying, I follow Paul,
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.600]   some saying Paul, some saying Peter.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.460]   And it was causing all kinds of divisions,
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.220]   and then Paul is trying to remind them,
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.980]   the division is coming because of your spiritual pride.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:39.620]   That somehow, some of you think you're more righteous
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:42.060]   because you've stood in the right line.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.460]   Some of you think you're more righteous
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.420]   because you have the right training,
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.520]   or whatever it is that you think you are.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.140]   And Paul comes in, and he says,
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.820]   "For consider your calling, brethren,
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.380]   "that there were not many wise according to the flesh."
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:59.180]   I want you to think about what he's saying here, okay?
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.960]   In other words, you weren't wise.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.660]   Not many were mighty.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.440]   You weren't mighty.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.780]   Not many were noble.
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.480]   You weren't noble.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.580]   But God has chosen the foolish things of the world,
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.980]   in other words, you were foolish,
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.940]   to shame the wise.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.900]   And God has chosen the weak things of the world,
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.020]   in other words, you are weak,
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.700]   to shame the things that are strong,
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.460]   and the base things of the world,
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.860]   the most fundamental.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.020]   In other words, you guys were low class.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.360]   And despised, God has chosen the things that are not,
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.060]   so that he may nullify the things that are.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.580]   So that no man may boast before God,
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.940]   but by his doing, you are in Christ Jesus.
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   The whole rebellion of mankind is his pride.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.340]   Satan wanted to get the glory and worship that God had.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.100]   Adam and Eve wanted to be like God.
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.620]   As soon as they had the opportunity,
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.780]   they built the Tower of Babel,
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.500]   because they wanted to get to God by their own strength.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.340]   And God deliberately destroys them and scatters them.
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:04.540]   And so the fundamental rebellion of mankind,
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.460]   is he wants to elevate himself near to God or above God.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:13.740]   God says he comes, and the gospel message is,
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.780]   that he's coming to destroy
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:21.240]   what the world considers wise,
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.040]   what the world considers strong,
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.660]   what the world considers noble.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:30.400]   And he's deliberately chosen the weak things,
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.240]   in order to dumbfound the wise.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.300]   So basically, what did he do?
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.340]   He flipped the table,
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:37.000]   and that's what he was trying to tell the disciples.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.220]   They were like anybody else.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.540]   They wanted to follow Jesus,
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:41.880]   and if they stay close to him enough,
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.020]   when the kingdom comes,
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.800]   am I gonna sit to the left or to the right?
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.220]   And that's why he deliberately got on his knees,
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:51.440]   to serve his disciples.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.560]   And to do the most menial task of washing their feet.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:59.300]   And he said, those who are the servants
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.140]   in the kingdom of God,
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.240]   they are the greatest in the kingdom.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.120]   He was taking the weakest things,
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.920]   and he was flipping the table over this sinful world,
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.600]   that's trying so hard to get on the top.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.920]   And that's why our salvation is described by,
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.760]   in Ephesians 2.8.9,
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.900]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.680]   "that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.680]   "not as a result of us, so that no one may boast."
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.580]   There is no boasting in the kingdom of God.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.680]   'Cause you didn't earn it.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.480]   I didn't earn it, you didn't earn it.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.800]   There is no boasting in the kingdom of God.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.980]   A Christian who is boasting, doesn't know the gospel.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.920]   He doesn't know Christ.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.320]   Because he thinks somehow he did it.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.800]   He thinks somehow he worked harder than other people.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.760]   He thinks somehow he achieved greater things.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.960]   See, the whole point of this Jericho,
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.160]   before he goes in, he reminds Joshua
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.720]   and the rest of Israel, it is not you.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:56.480]   This wall's gonna fall, but it has nothing to do with you.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.600]   If anything, you deserve to be crushed.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.940]   If this promise that God made was a conditional promise
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.720]   that God made to Abraham,
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.620]   it would've been done a long time ago.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.480]   You guys would've never made it out of Egypt.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.280]   You would've never made it through the Red Sea.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.100]   You would've never crossed the Jordan River, if it was you.
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:22.200]   That was the point that he was trying to make.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.080]   He's trying to be faithful to his own covenant.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:30.320]   Now, as fundamental as this is to our faith,
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.200]   it is so hard to shake.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.100]   It's so hard to shake.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:42.040]   Because ever since we were born, we're taught to mature.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.400]   And what does mature mean?
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.840]   To be independent, to take care of yourself, right?
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:51.400]   I remember when that thought really gripped me.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:55.320]   I think I was a freshman or a sophomore in college,
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.560]   and I had a job out here in Irvine.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:01.360]   I was going to Biola, and somebody I knew
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.920]   was a manager of some restaurant over here,
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.540]   so I had to come here every day,
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.860]   five to one in the afternoon.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:12.240]   And I remember working, and I just happened
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.840]   to be really sick that day, and there was nobody
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.700]   to replace me, so I came into work.
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:20.660]   And I was just sweating, I had a fever,
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.320]   and I was a cashier, and I was feeling so bad,
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.920]   and I was thinking, I need a break.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.040]   But there's no break, 'cause no one could take my place,
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.360]   and the boss who was there, he needed me to do my job,
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.920]   'cause nobody else, he can't run the thing.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.300]   So I remember feeling so bad, and it got so bad
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:43.020]   in the middle, I went into the closet, and I threw up.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:45.580]   And I was coughing, I was sweating,
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.980]   and as soon as I caught my breath,
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.380]   I had to go back out to work.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.100]   And I was there for the rest of the day,
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.980]   probably about three, four hours, just sweating,
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.420]   and just barely making it.
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.680]   And through that whole process of misery,
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.960]   I was thinking, this is life.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:02.820]   That's what I was thinking, this is life.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.020]   No one's gonna help you.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.480]   Right?
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.880]   Your mom is not around, you're not a kid anymore.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.200]   Grow up, Peter, this is life, right?
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.680]   Things get hard, suck it up.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.480]   So that's been my theme of life since, suck it up.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.320]   Right, there's certain things that you can't change.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.960]   Sometimes bad things happen, right?
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.320]   Sometimes you're sick and you have to go to work.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.740]   Suck it up, right?
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.760]   So that's kind of like, I pride myself being,
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.020]   you know, suck it up, but it needs to get done,
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.740]   needs to get done, you know?
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.220]   So I thought I was the suck it up king,
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:42.160]   and then I met my wife, and she's really the suck it up king.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.740]   But the reason why this is so hard is because
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.820]   the world values hard work, right?
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.700]   We talk about how many of our immigrant parents
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.140]   work two jobs and three jobs.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.100]   They work so hard to achieve what they,
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.260]   and we value that, we look up to that.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:03.520]   When we raise our kids, right?
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.400]   Money doesn't grow off of trees, you bum.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.240]   Get a job, right?
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.040]   Do your work, the harder you work,
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.840]   the more you can achieve.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:15.280]   So everything that we do since we're children,
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.320]   we're taught to work hard, to move ahead, to get ahead.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.040]   Even as Christians, work hard to be disciplined,
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.680]   to memorize scripture, to pray longer,
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.060]   and study the Bible, all of these things.
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.620]   Again, none of these things in and of itself,
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:31.000]   innately, is wrong.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.700]   But that is so hard to shake.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:38.860]   Because when it comes to our spiritual life,
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.920]   it does so much damage.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.280]   Because the very get-go of our salvation
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:49.360]   is to come before God and recognize how helpless we are,
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.360]   and that's what brings us to repentance.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.280]   Repentance isn't, you know what,
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.160]   I should've gotten an A, but I got a C,
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.400]   but I'm gonna try harder to get an A.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.800]   That's not repentance.
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.020]   Repentance that leads to salvation is recognizing
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.260]   that I can never bridge this gap.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:10.060]   There is nothing I can do to bridge this gap
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.300]   between me and this holy God.
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:14.580]   And so I surrender.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:18.140]   I repent not only of what I did, I repent of who I am.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:21.420]   And you completely surrender everything to God,
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:22.740]   you're in charge now.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.200]   That's what begins our salvation.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:31.180]   But at some point in our sanctification, we pick back up.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:35.640]   I'm gonna work harder, I'm gonna be better.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.560]   We make resolutions.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.000]   And then when things don't turn out the way it does,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.560]   we get frustrated, where's God?
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.000]   Again, don't get me wrong, right?
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.280]   Remember where chapter 11 is.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.980]   By faith, they did all of this.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:53.160]   But the important part of this is by faith.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.560]   By faith.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.060]   Our strength to do anything is by faith.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.420]   Not simply our determination,
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.300]   not simply because of our knowledge,
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.060]   not because of our experience,
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.420]   but because of our connection to God.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.980]   And that's the point that he's trying to tell us.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.060]   Remember when Jesus shows up?
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:15.240]   Remember the zealots?
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.420]   The zealots were people who were willing to die
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.300]   to preserve Israel.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.500]   So they were always ready to go.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.140]   They had a knife carrying around,
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.300]   and if they get an opportunity,
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.660]   they're gonna knife somebody and create a revolution.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.900]   So these guys, in their own way, were picking up the cross.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.860]   They were sacrificing,
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.780]   because they were willing to die for Israel.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.900]   Jesus didn't come to them and say, "Good job.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.020]   "Good job, zealots."
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.380]   He didn't see the Sadducees,
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.620]   who were very politically savvy.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.140]   They're going to preserve Israel
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.460]   through having a great relationship with the Romans,
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.460]   and they use their intellect and their influence
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.500]   to be able to preserve Israel.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.540]   So they were politically trying to preserve the nation.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.700]   Jesus didn't show up to the Sadducees and say, "Good job.
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.820]   "You guys are so savvy,
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:06.620]   "and because of you, Israel is being preserved."
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.060]   He didn't say to the Sadducees,
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.220]   who were trying so hard to keep the law.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:14.500]   The Bible says, and Jesus says,
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.460]   they were proselytizing, they were praying,
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.580]   they were tithing.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.300]   As far as discipline is concerned,
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.260]   they were more disciplined than anybody else.
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:25.260]   And he didn't say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant,
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.300]   "because you tried harder than anybody else."
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.500]   That's not what he said.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:33.440]   He said, "You pray, but you pray for other people to see.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.060]   "You study the Bible so that you can show off.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.460]   "You're proselytizing, and you proselytize and convert them
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.420]   "and make them just as much,
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.140]   "twice as much the son of the devil than you.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.120]   "You give, but you give so that other people
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.820]   "can recognize how generous you are.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.900]   "Everything that you're doing,
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.300]   "you're doing for other people to see."
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.220]   He didn't say, "Good job."
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.300]   You know what, he was always amazed.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.940]   Whenever you see the term, "Jesus was amazed,"
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.500]   do you know what follows after that?
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.340]   He was amazed by their faith.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:06.340]   Whether they were rich or poor,
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.380]   whether they were strong or weak,
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:11.540]   what surprised Jesus was always their faith.
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.380]   What disappointment, when he was disappointed,
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.100]   he would say, "You of little faith."
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.960]   It was their faith.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.260]   It was what connected them to the holy God,
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:27.060]   because their power didn't come from them.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.660]   Their righteousness didn't come from them.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.800]   Their fruit didn't come from them.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.860]   It's their faith.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.340]   Whatever faith that they had is what connected them
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.300]   to this holy God that caused them to be fruitful.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.340]   That's why he said, "If you wanna be fruitful,
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.860]   "work hard, wanna be fruitful, study hard.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.820]   "If you wanna be fruitful," he said, "Abide."
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.620]   Abide.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:56.060]   Stay, stay, remain, remain.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:01.060]   So our primary call as Christians is to abide in Christ,
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.620]   abide in Christ, to stay in Christ,
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.780]   to remain in Christ, to trust in Christ,
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.620]   to continue in Christ.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.380]   That is our primary call.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.320]   Anything else is human arrogance.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.940]   It's our effort to work hard to get ahead,
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.280]   to move ahead, to be better, stronger.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:27.220]   It is when we are weak, he is strong.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.780]   That's why the only instruction that God gives Joshua
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.940]   in Joshua 1, six through nine,
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.020]   he says, "To be strong and courageous.
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.860]   "For you shall give this people possession of the land
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.100]   "which I swore to their forefathers.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.540]   "Only be strong and courageous."
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.260]   Verse eight, "This book of the law
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.540]   "shall not depart from your mouth,
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.080]   "but you shall meditate on it day and night
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.680]   "so that you may be careful to do all that is written in it,
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.160]   "for then you will make your way prosperous
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.820]   "and then you will have success."
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.380]   And it said, the only instruction is,
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:59.260]   "Be strong and courageous, do exactly as I tell you."
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.380]   Don't turn from it to the left or to the right.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.460]   Whether it makes sense or doesn't make sense.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.900]   And remember, the instruction God gave them was,
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.300]   when you get in there, remember that Ark of the Covenant,
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.540]   remember that box that I gave you, right?
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:16.300]   Get seven priests to walk ahead of the rest of you,
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.300]   and the distance was about 2,000 cubit.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.380]   2,000 cubit is about half a mile,
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:22.960]   a little bit more than half a mile, right?
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.460]   So seven priests, I mean, think about it.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:29.940]   If you're going into battle, that's the worst thing to do.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.740]   Like, all they're doing is marching, right?
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.520]   And my guess is, while they're marching,
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.900]   they're muslim, these guys are descendants of grumblers.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.740]   You know what I mean?
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.580]   My guess is somebody grumbling is like,
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.540]   "What are we doing?
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:46.460]   Didn't he say we're gonna conquer this land?
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.300]   How's this train?
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.580]   We're tired."
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.340]   Every day, carry the box, seven priests.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.820]   And this is what they did for six days, right?
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:58.880]   I mean, this is going to conquer Jericho?
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.660]   My guess is there was some grumbling in there, right?
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.940]   It's not recorded, but my guess is, right?
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.420]   Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, right?
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.880]   On the seventh day, this is the day
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.000]   that the Lord's gonna give you this.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.400]   What should we do?
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.440]   Well, remember how you carry that box?
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.800]   This time, do it seven times.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.800]   Seven times.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.400]   That's what they did.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.920]   Exactly what God said.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.000]   Don't turn from it to the left or to the right.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.440]   They carried this box, seven priests, right?
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.480]   And it wasn't sharpen your sword, right?
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.920]   Go in there and flank.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.440]   You go left, you go right,
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.280]   and then I'll be the command when I blow the trumpet,
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.040]   all you guys rise, none of that.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.480]   Just carry this box, right?
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.040]   Which, the covenant was representative
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.200]   of the presence of God in Israel.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.360]   And it was to show the nation of Israel
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.720]   that the Lord is gonna give you this, not you.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.820]   So you know what happens.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.240]   They marched seven times.
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.800]   Can you imagine how tired they were after seven?
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.240]   I know there were wanderers in the desert,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.400]   but seven times around the city carrying this box.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.480]   And then they stopped and they're like,
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.920]   oh my gosh, I'm so tired.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.240]   Okay, and then blow the trumpet.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.760]   They blow the trumpet, exactly as God said,
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.720]   and the wall comes tumbling down,
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.480]   and all they did was just walk in, right?
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.800]   And exactly as God said, it wasn't you.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.640]   It wasn't you.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.040]   In fact, the primary sin of Israel
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.200]   was whenever they forgot that and they became proud,
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.440]   and that's when sin started coming into their camp.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.180]   So the same lesson that God's been trying to teach them
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.960]   over and over again, it is not you.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.360]   Your strength does not come from you.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.560]   Your might does not come from you.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.000]   Your wisdom doesn't come from you.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.840]   Your power, your fruit, it doesn't come from you.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:57.780]   Abide in me, abide in me, abide in me, abide in me.
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:02.820]   Do not boast, do not boast, do not boast, do not boast.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:08.420]   It's like Joshua, when he was ready in Joshua 3, 5,
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.340]   he says, "Consecrate yourselves,
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.140]   "for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you."
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.800]   So Joshua knew, right?
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.140]   So that was the first question.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:18.400]   Why is Joshua's name not there?
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.700]   Because Joshua was not the central figure.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.820]   Whether his name was mentioned or it wasn't mentioned,
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.340]   it was not, that was not the point.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:29.380]   The point is what God was doing, right?
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.780]   But the second question,
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.340]   we're not gonna spend a lot of time on this one,
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.060]   then why is Rahab's name mentioned?
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.780]   In fact, it's not just Rahab, right?
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:42.220]   At some point in history, Rahab was a harlot.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.700]   But because her name is written in the Bible,
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:48.420]   she will forever be known as Rahab the harlot.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.980]   Because that's how it was mentioned to us in Joshua,
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.100]   and that's how it's mentioned to us here.
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.940]   Why is the fact that she was a harlot described here?
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.060]   David is not described as David the murderer.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:01.820]   Right?
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.740]   David is not described to us as David the adulterer,
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.180]   David the murderer, right?
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:08.540]   God forgave David.
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:13.060]   But why is Rahab's name even on this list of,
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.940]   I mean, think about who's on this list, right?
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.420]   Abraham, right?
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.260]   Abraham's on it.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:23.020]   Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joseph.
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.540]   I mean, think about the people on this list.
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.100]   And then we skip Joshua.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.940]   And then Rahab the harlot, right?
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:33.420]   Do you think when we get to heaven,
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.580]   we're gonna see Rahab's like,
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.060]   there's Rahab the harlot, right?
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.080]   And I don't, I hope not.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.700]   But why is that emphasized here?
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.180]   Why is her name here when Joshua's name is not?
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:49.420]   And think about what exactly did Rahab do
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:54.320]   that was worth being on this list?
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.980]   Well, only thing that we know is Joshua 2, 8 through 11,
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.180]   this is what Rahab says.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.220]   The spies come to spy out the land
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.780]   and she basically protects them.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:05.300]   But the reason why she protects them
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.060]   is what is mentioned in verse eight.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.220]   Now, before they lay down,
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.560]   she came up to them on the roof and said to the men,
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.220]   this is the Israelites who are hiding,
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.980]   "I know that the Lord has given you the land
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.220]   "and that the terror of you has fallen on us
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.980]   "and that all the inhabitants of the land
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.740]   "have melted away before you."
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.580]   In other words, she was scared, right?
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.700]   Before they even came,
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.260]   there was a reputation of the Israelites.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.100]   And this is what she says.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.620]   Verse 10, "For we have heard how the Lord
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.620]   "dried up the water of the Red Sea."
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:37.180]   Remember when that happened 40 years ago, right?
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.500]   "Dried up the water of the Red Sea before you
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.340]   "when you came out of Egypt."
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:44.580]   I said, wow, the Egyptians couldn't find them.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.380]   God delivered them from Egypt.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.580]   They heard about that.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:52.280]   And what you did to the two kings of Amorites
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.420]   and beyond the Jordan to Sihon and Og,
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.500]   whom you utterly destroyed.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.700]   "When we heard of it, our hearts melted
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.780]   "and no courage remained in any man
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.520]   "any longer because of you.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.780]   "For the Lord your God, he is God in heaven,
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.780]   "above and on the earth below."
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.460]   Think about this great faith
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.620]   that made it into the Hall of Fame, right?
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.660]   What was it that she did?
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:18.260]   Look at the way it's described.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:21.500]   "By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish."
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.460]   Did not perish along with the other disobedient.
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.540]   That was the claim to fame.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.620]   She didn't die.
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:32.460]   That's why she's on this list of people, right?
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.400]   The cloud of witnesses that went there.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.680]   "Rahab the harlot by faith did not perish
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.940]   "along with the others who were disobedient."
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:45.100]   She was trying to save herself
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:49.820]   'cause she heard that here's this nation coming.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.300]   Clearly they're not powerful.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.300]   "But there's something supernatural going on."
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.060]   And she believed it was their God.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:02.260]   I mean, what kind of God do you serve
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.260]   that even the Egyptians can't bind you?
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.480]   And so the terror fell upon everybody else,
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.500]   but the difference with her
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.800]   is she decided to side with Israel.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.140]   She lies.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.040]   No, they're not here, right?
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.740]   There's nothing necessarily noble about what she did
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.740]   other than she was trying to save her neck
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.740]   and she was trying to save her family, that's it.
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.860]   But the reason why she made it on this list
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.060]   is because by faith.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.440]   It's because she believed.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:37.020]   She believed in the God of Israel
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:40.460]   more than whatever it is that she was holding on to.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:43.580]   So the point of this isn't about Rahab,
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.700]   it's not about Joshua, it's not about Moses,
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.180]   it's not about Abraham.
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:48.220]   It's about by faith.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.940]   That's why each of these passages
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:53.420]   start with by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.740]   That even Rahab the harlot was preserved
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.900]   and even in her imperfect life,
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.540]   known as a harlot, because of faith,
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.280]   she made it into the Hall of Fame.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:13.680]   There's going to be a lot of people in heaven,
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.140]   I believe, that we're gonna be surprised to see.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.500]   You got there?
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:22.420]   How did you get up here?
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:27.300]   I know your life, I know what you did.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.200]   You're constantly struggling.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.340]   Yeah, but I believed.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.300]   There's gonna be some people up there
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:38.500]   that I think many of us are gonna be surprised.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.100]   And then there's gonna be some people up there
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.300]   thinking like, how come he's not here?
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.380]   How come she's not here?
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.100]   Because you and I have a tendency
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.060]   to measure everything by what we see.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.860]   What did they achieve, what did they not achieve?
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.500]   What did they do, how much did they sacrifice?
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.580]   We measure everything by what we see.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:01.100]   God measures our righteousness by our faith.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:05.960]   God measures our production by our faith.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.500]   And so by faith, even somebody like a harlot
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.180]   made it onto this list of Hall of Fame.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:19.900]   In fact, eventually she ends up marrying an Israelite.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.340]   She becomes a great, great, great, great grandfather
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.940]   of King David, and then King David's
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.740]   a great, great, great, great, great grandfather of Jesus.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.340]   And so she made it onto this list.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:37.500]   I don't know about you, but our God is amazing.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:44.880]   I mean, it humbles us and lifts us up at the same time.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.880]   It destroys our pride and fills us with hope
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.780]   all at the same time.
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:58.280]   Like, you're nothing, they'll kill you.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.040]   And then you're filled with confidence
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.040]   and courage at the same time.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:09.760]   He destroys our pride because only when our pride
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.200]   is destroyed will he be lifted up.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.540]   And let me finish with this.
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:19.540]   Remember the story of Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.640]   And those two stories are really meant to be read together
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.320]   because John is introducing the gospel
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.520]   and Nicodemus comes out because he's considered
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.520]   the most righteous man because he's on the Sanhedrin
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.160]   and he's a Pharisee among Pharisees,
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.220]   so he kept the law perfect.
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.920]   So he comes, and remember, he's afraid of his reputation.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.200]   He comes at night so that his friends wouldn't see.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.840]   And he's conversing with Jesus like,
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.440]   how do I get to heaven?
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.000]   Jesus says, you must be born again.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:47.840]   Born again?
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.720]   How does a man be born again?
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.360]   It's like, well, you can't.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.000]   That's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.840]   So he tells this man who had a reputation of being holy,
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.280]   who's already made it to the top of the heap,
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.520]   all of that's not gonna help you at all, right?
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.960]   You have to be born again.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.160]   The very next chapter, he meets a Samaritan woman.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.240]   We don't even know her name.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.360]   She's not even mentioned by name,
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.760]   she's just Samaritan woman.
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.840]   By the Jews, who's considered half-breeds, right?
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.760]   They were compromisers.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.780]   They weren't considered righteous.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.520]   And Jesus actually pursues after her.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.580]   She's come to the middle of the day,
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.400]   and she was probably considered a harlot
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.760]   among the Samaritans, and he talks to her,
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.420]   and he draws her out and says,
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.560]   the water that I give you will give you eternal life,
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.640]   and you won't be thirsty again.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.140]   And then she meets Christ,
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:42.560]   and she becomes the first evangelist to the Samaritans.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.160]   The Samaritans come to Christ as a result of her.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.080]   But if you read that two-story together,
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.920]   here's this man who's filled with pride,
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.480]   who's top of righteousness, according to Israel.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.380]   He humbles him and says, you must be born again.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:59.460]   And then he chases after this woman who was living in sin,
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.040]   and then raises her up,
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:06.200]   to tell them that the gospel brings the mountains low
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.360]   and the valleys high,
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.480]   and the entrance into the kingdom is the same door.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.880]   Whether you are high, whether you are significant,
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.520]   whether you are educated, whether you are talented,
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.160]   no matter how old you are,
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.640]   no matter how awful you think you are,
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.040]   no matter what your past is,
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040]   no matter how much you've fallen,
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.440]   it is the same grace of God
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.520]   that brings us through the same door.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:35.480]   So the point of chapter 11 is by faith, by faith,
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.280]   by faith, by faith.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   It is not, it is not because of my faithfulness
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:51.360]   that our church has gotten here.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.120]   It is not because of the faithfulness
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.940]   of a few of the leaders that our church got here.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:02.640]   And I'm not saying that as a humble brag,
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.920]   'cause I know myself better than you know me.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.200]   And God knows me much better than even I know myself.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:18.260]   Whatever fruit that we are allowed to experience,
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.980]   God is pursuing his own glory.
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.000]   If there's anything that I have to work toward,
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.200]   it's to make sure that we don't touch that glory.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:32.240]   It is man's arrogance to think that somehow,
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.360]   if we have the right smart people, disciplined people,
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.820]   trained people, good people, that we'll see good things.
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:44.260]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.800]   See, when we recognize that,
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.240]   we can be more patient with people who are struggling.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.740]   We can be more patient with people who are not up to par.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:59.400]   We can help them, we can assist them,
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.960]   but we can be more patient
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.460]   because we see ourselves in the same boat.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.320]   'Cause we're all saved by grace.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.820]   We're all working to get to God.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:14.320]   So whether you are Rahab, whether you are Joshua,
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:18.320]   by faith and by faith alone, we're gonna make it to heaven.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.560]   I pray that this truth that Hebrews 11
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.840]   keeps pounding over and over and over and over again
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:31.120]   would really transform our paradigm
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.000]   of how we look at our spiritual life
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.780]   and how we work toward honoring God.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:43.880]   Because what God has called us to show the world
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.020]   should look different than the world.
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:50.860]   In the world, you work hard, you make a lot of money,
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:55.860]   you become something successful, you become influential,
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:58.880]   then you become honored, then people follow you,
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.780]   then you are adored, that's the world.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.680]   But the kingdom of God is completely different.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.540]   The kingdom of God challenges the principles of this world
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.720]   where he dumbfounds the world
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.280]   where people who are nothing,
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.740]   people who recognize that we have nothing,
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:24.400]   and yet this community glorifies and magnifies Christ.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.480]   By faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.920]   Let's take a few minutes to pray.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.040]   Again, as we ask the, pray seem to come back up.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.140]   To take some time to reflect and think.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:42.680]   All of us, to some degree or another,
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.560]   some of you are A students, spiritually,
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.920]   or maybe you think you are.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:53.700]   Some of you are F students.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:57.620]   You're like, oh my gosh, I keep struggling
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.620]   with the same thing over and over again.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:00.980]   Right?
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:05.100]   And many of us fall somewhere in between
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:10.160]   because all of our eyes are focused on ourselves.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.540]   And that's the whole point, is to take our eyes off
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.080]   of ourselves and see God.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:20.220]   Because if your hope is on yourself, look at God.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:24.820]   You will lose all confidence, you will lose all hope.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.140]   And yet when we look at the cross,
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:29.620]   God restores all of it back.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.460]   So let's take a step back and think, right?
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:39.660]   And to thank God that it is by faith and by faith alone.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:43.660]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship people lead us.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.580]   (soft piano music)
[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.420]   (soft piano music)

[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:26.820]   Let's go ahead and rise together for a closing praise.

[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:28.660]   - Let's pray.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:35.420]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for our salvation.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:41.140]   Help us, Lord God, not to take for granted how we got here.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:45.540]   That it is only by your grace, only by your love,
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:51.060]   help us, Lord God, to take our eyes off of ourselves,
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:56.860]   our tendency, Lord, to look for man for comfort and refuge.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:59.900]   I pray that you would help us,
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:04.460]   that you would not simply be a figure
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.700]   that we've imagined in our head,
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.980]   but that you would become more and more real to us each day,
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.980]   that our greatest longing is to see you face to face,
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.980]   to worship you, Father God, not from a distance,
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.940]   but to draw near to you,
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.580]   that our longing would be for your second coming.
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:26.880]   And so we pray, Father God, that you would cause us,
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.520]   whether we have small faith or whether we have great faith,
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.400]   that through it, Lord,
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.660]   that we may have a greater vision of who you are.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:38.820]   Open our eyes this week, Lord God, to your word.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.340]   Open our eyes to see your glory in creation.
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:44.740]   Open our eyes, Lord God, to see the greatness
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:47.260]   of the things that you've already given us,
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:50.700]   that our hearts may be filled with thankfulness, Lord God,
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:53.340]   to not to live day to day longing, Lord,
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:55.600]   for something to be fixed in our surrounding,
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.260]   but to give you glory for all the things
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.740]   that you've already given us.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:04.420]   So we pray, Father God, that as we celebrate your name,
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:07.380]   that we would live lives in such a way
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:11.600]   that the world may see that we are your followers,
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:15.940]   that we will be able to proclaim, Lord God,
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:19.300]   that Christ is the only hope of salvation.
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.940]   So help us wherever you send us,
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:23.540]   that we would be the aroma of Christ this week.
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.380]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
