[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.900]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 14, starting from verse 13 to 19.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.640]   And I know Elder Gerald already read that, but again, I want you guys to be familiar
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.160]   with the text that we're going to be in this morning.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.480]   Romans chapter 14, 13 to 19.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.880]   "Teachers, let us not pass judgment on one another."
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880]   Oh, sorry.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.980]   "Therefore, let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.520]   to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.320]   I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but is
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.800]   unclean for anyone who thinks it's unclean.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.080]   For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.080]   By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.040]   So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.220]   For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.360]   and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.140]   Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.480]   So thus let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding."
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.600]   Let's pray.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.480]   Heavenly Father, we entrust this time to you, asking Lord God that you would bless us.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.880]   Let your word speak and convict and guide and encourage this morning.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520]   If I was to ask you a question, how do you measure if someone is a mature Christian or
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.280]   not?
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.120]   The way you answer that question may depend on your background, what you have been taught,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.960]   maybe the previous church that you came from, maybe the denomination.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.560]   Some people might say that, again, if you go to a heavily Bible-emphasizing church,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.840]   that if you know the Bible well, if you read plenty of books and you know theology, that
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.720]   maybe that's how we measure if somebody is mature, because they spent a lot of time wrestling
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.220]   over theology.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.080]   If you happen to come from maybe a charismatic background, the way that that community may
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.720]   have emphasized, and maybe various spiritual gifts, and maybe you have healing, maybe you
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.480]   have prophecy, whatever it may be, maybe in that context, that's how you measured if somebody
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   was mature.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.100]   They had many encounters with God, many testimonies.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.520]   Or maybe you came from a background where there was a lot of discipline emphasized,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.860]   structure.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.320]   And so the way that spiritual maturity is measured by how disciplined you are and how
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.920]   many disciples that you have made.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.040]   All of these things, on the surface, may point to certain things and say that that may look
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.160]   like what a mature Christian should look like.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.600]   But it's not as complicated as that.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.800]   I think the scripture is pretty clear what we ought to be looking for to measure if someone
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.600]   is a mature Christian or not.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.440]   All of these things may be true, but in and of itself, all it does is make someone a good
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.760]   Pharisee.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.600]   In Matthew chapter 23, 23, Jesus says to the Pharisees, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   hypocrites!
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.880]   For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.800]   law, justice and mercy and faithfulness.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.960]   These you ought to have done without neglecting the others."
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.640]   The problem was not that they didn't study the Bible or they didn't pray enough or they
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.120]   didn't evangelize enough.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.600]   He said you should have done all of that, but they were neglecting the weightier matters.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.400]   And if you look at the weightier matters, the weightier matters were things of internal,
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.140]   of mercy, of justice.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.440]   In fact, Jesus made it very clear.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.040]   You could tell someone by what?
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.160]   By their fruit, what they produce.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.440]   Now all of these things that I've mentioned, whether it's proper theology or discipline
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.320]   or discipleship or spiritual gifts, all of these things may be signs of fruit, one of
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.780]   the fruits.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.280]   But the main fruit that the scripture tells us to look for is what?
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.880]   The fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.160]   In the fruit of the Holy Spirit, in Galatians 5.22, it says, "But the fruit of the Spirit
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.000]   is first and foremost," what?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   "Love."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.280]   Love is the primary fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.800]   The evidence that the Holy Spirit is indwelling in an individual and having its effect on
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.580]   us is love.
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.600]   And all these other descriptions of peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.960]   gentleness, self-control, against such things there is no law.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.440]   All of these things are directly connected to the fruit of love.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.120]   You can't have peace if there is no love.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.660]   You can't have kindness if there is no love.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.260]   You can't have goodness if there is no love.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.540]   So love is not just one of many fruits, it is the fruit in how we ought to determine
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.720]   whether somebody is mature or immature.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.480]   Because without love, and you can have all these other spiritual qualities, but without
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.040]   love it just makes you a good Pharisee.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.960]   And that's exactly what Jesus was saying to these Pharisees.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:11.920]   That you are so concerned about these external matters, but internally all you are is a nicely
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.600]   decorated tomb.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.680]   Paul has been talking about in 11 chapters of what justification of faith looks like.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.280]   How we've been justified, the blood of Christ, what does it mean?
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.480]   What does adoption look like?
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   What does it mean to be saved?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.800]   He's in 11 chapters of exposition, and then now we're in chapter 12 describing about the
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.960]   application considering this mercy.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.320]   And he begins by offering your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, not to be conformed but
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.360]   be transformed by the reading of your mind.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.160]   And then since then he's been on this topic of love.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.380]   Even though whether he used the word love or not, you can clearly see starting from
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:01.480]   chapter 12, the whole application of our Christian life is the practice of love.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.040]   Jesus himself said, if there's one quality that's going to distinguish you from the world
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.460]   is love.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.240]   How you practice love, what kind of love you practice, the kind of love that he practiced
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.520]   with us.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.960]   So all these other qualities, there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.400]   In fact, as a maturing Christian, these are qualities that we should be growing and increasing
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   in.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.420]   But in and of itself, devoid of love, only makes us hypocrites and Pharisees.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.480]   So this morning, we want to look at these few verses that Paul is describing about the
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   practice of his love.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.040]   Like, what does it mean to walk in love?
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   If walking is love is the central, most important aspect of Christian life, what does it mean
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.160]   to walk in love?
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.360]   So again, today's message is pretty simple.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.960]   It's a two point outline.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.600]   And then if you pay attention, you'll realize it could only, it really is just one.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.760]   But I separate it in two so that I don't lose you in the middle of the sermon.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.920]   Okay, but really it's just one point.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.280]   What does it mean to walk in love?
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:08.760]   The first point, Paul describes in verse 13, walking in love means to judge to build and
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   not judge to condemn.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.240]   Let me say that again.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.720]   Walking in love means to judge to build and not judge to condemn.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.120]   Romans chapter 14, 13, in the ESV, you don't really get the full meaning of what Paul is
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   trying to say here.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.840]   In verse 13, it says, "Therefore, let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.280]   rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother."
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:43.800]   The word for decide here in the ESV is actually the same word for what he used to, in English,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.640]   translated judgment.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.240]   So King James actually translated literally, and this is what you would read literally
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.320]   in the English if you were to translate literally.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.820]   "Let us not therefore judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.920]   a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way."
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:13.480]   So in other words, he's saying, don't judge to condemn, but judge to build up.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.480]   He says it again in 1 Corinthians 10.23, "All things are lawful, but not all things are
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.480]   helpful.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.840]   All things are lawful, but not all things build up."
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.000]   Let me clarify this before we go any further.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.480]   Paul is not advocating relativism in the church.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.320]   He's not saying, it doesn't matter what you believe as long as you're sincere about it,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.120]   so let's just not fight over any issue.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.440]   He's talking about, remember last week we talked about who is a weak brother and who
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.360]   is a strong brother.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:50.160]   He's talking about in the matters that are not essential, in the matters that are not
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.720]   essential, that we ought to practice grace and love.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:03.520]   Paul has a clear opinion upon this, but how do you deal with issues where you can easily
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.840]   divide because of various opinions?
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.680]   The reason why Paul says what he says in Corinthians 10, where he says, "All things are lawful,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.560]   but not all things are helpful," is because this is exactly what was happening in Corinth.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.720]   Remember what the problem was?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.400]   The problem was not a divide between a group of people who wanted to chase after the world
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.000]   and another group of people who wanted to have idol worship and other people who wanted
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   to follow Jesus.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.720]   That's not where the divide was happening.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   The divide was happening with sincere believers who had a difference of opinion of who should
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.640]   be the leader of Corinth.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.640]   It should be Apollos because he's the gifted guy.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.160]   It should be Peter because he's the leader among the apostles.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   It should be Paul because Paul is the one who first brought the gospel to Corinth.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.520]   So it is in the context of doing what they believe is righteous, but they weren't on
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520]   the same page.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.000]   And then this divided the church and all kinds of chaos came into the church.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.240]   They couldn't deal with sin.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.120]   The worship was in absolute chaos.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.640]   Even the communion table ended up causing bitterness and anger.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:15.080]   The root of all of that was a church who was refusing to give in to each other.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.200]   So that's why Paul says, "All things are lawful."
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.120]   What you're doing is not sinful, but it's not helpful.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.520]   It is not building up the church.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520]   It's dividing the church.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.480]   Again, in 1 Corinthians 14, 12.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.760]   So with yourself, since you are eager for manifestation of the Spirit, strive to excel
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.320]   in building up the church.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.500]   This was a church that was blessed by God and all kinds of spiritual gifts were given
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.720]   to this church.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   They had prophets.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.080]   They had speaking in tongues.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:49.280]   They had various manifestations of the gifts in the early church.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:55.120]   And they were practicing this without considering how their practice of the gifts were affecting
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.840]   other people.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.720]   So one of the things that Paul points out here is that they had a group of people who
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.040]   were speaking in tongues, but they were coming out and they just didn't care how it affected
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   other people.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   And then there were people who were prophesying in the middle of the server, just standing
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.040]   up.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.440]   "I have something for me to tell you."
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.240]   And they were just prophesying one another in chaos.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.060]   So it's in that context where Paul is saying, all of these things may be a blessing to you,
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:30.340]   but the purpose why he gave it to you was to bless and to build up the body of Christ.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.640]   So this division in the church wasn't happening because they wanted the world over God.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.200]   It was a group of people who wanted to pursue God, but had differences of opinion.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.300]   And it is in that context he says all things are lawful, but not all things are helpful.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.820]   Some people eat, some people don't eat, but the end conclusion of our judgment ought to
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.440]   be not to condemn, but to build up.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.760]   Let me make this very clear.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   And this really is the main point of the whole sermon.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:11.720]   The practice of truth without love always leads to condemnation.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:17.680]   The practice of truth without love always leads to condemnation.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.200]   If we pursue truth without practicing grace and love, ultimately for the purpose of building
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.840]   up the church, there is nobody who will pass this test.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.680]   Some people have been Christians longer, some people may be more disciplined, some people
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:39.960]   may have better theology, but nobody will pass this test of somebody's intention to
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:45.760]   examine everybody else to see if they're living up to what they deem to be righteous.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.480]   You won't know enough theology.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.320]   You won't be disciplined enough.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.680]   You won't be sacrificial enough.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:58.440]   If we pursue truth without love and grace, it will always lead to condemnation.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.800]   And I'm going to revisit that later on, because that's the main thrust of what Paul is really
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.400]   trying to say, that we ought to judge to build and not judge to condemn.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.340]   The church is a tremendous blessing that God has given us.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.620]   We mourn together and we celebrate together.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.960]   We encourage one another.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.600]   We lean on each other.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.320]   As a church, there are things that we can do that we would never be able to do by ourselves.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.440]   The reason why we're able to go out to China and to India and then Japan this summer and
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   do all we do is because of the collective body of Christ that we're running this race
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.800]   together.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:46.560]   There's a benefit of having diversity in the church from various backgrounds, education,
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.600]   different fields, various ages, different culture.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.320]   All of these things benefit the body of Christ.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.120]   Especially now, we live in a culture where there really isn't true community.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.360]   More and more people are becoming isolated, where you work in a little cubicle, you sit
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.560]   in front of a computer screen, you go home, and then you sit in front of another computer
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   screen.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.800]   Then if that's not enough, you sit in front of a tiny computer screen.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.400]   You go to a coffee shop and you blast the music so you can't hear each other.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:23.040]   True community really doesn't exist, at least in our generation, at least not where we live.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.920]   This is a tremendous blessing from God.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:30.360]   In fact, I would say I don't ever remember not attending church.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.520]   Some of my best memories of childhood was from church.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.240]   My dad was a pastor as long as I can remember.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.360]   Earliest childhood memories is celebrating Christmas together at the church and doing
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.760]   presentations up on the stage and receiving gifts and somebody dressing up like Santa
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.240]   and passing out gifts.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.680]   Whether you agree with that or not, that was some of my best memories as a child.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.880]   But also, some of the worst memories I have of childhood is also in the church.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:09.040]   Slandering, divisions in the church, backbiting, sometimes even physical fighting I've seen
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.100]   in the church.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:18.200]   The church could either be a place of tremendous blessing, but if love, the glue that brings
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.320]   us together, is not the central motivation, is not the central pursuit of the church,
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.240]   all of our diversity becomes a conflict.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.400]   All of our differences, all of the different perspectives, all of it ends up becoming a
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.480]   source of contention in the church.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.600]   It's no different in the marriage.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:45.400]   In Romans 14, 16, it says, "So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil."
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.240]   What he means by that is eating meat or not eating meat, in and of itself, could be a
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   blessing.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.720]   It's just food for you.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.680]   But if you eat that, just completely ignoring the context, while it is destroying the conscience
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:03.540]   of other people, the very gift that God has given you can easily turn into something evil.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.040]   The very blessing that God has given the Corinthian church, the spiritual gift to build up the
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.620]   body of Christ, but because they were completely ignoring other people, it was causing confusion
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.240]   and bitterness and hatred toward one another.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.440]   That's what he's saying.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.800]   Don't turn what is good and turn it into evil.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.240]   God gave them the gospel to build up the body of Christ, to continue to spread this good
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.960]   news, but because they were fighting over, "Well, who should we listen to?
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.280]   Who shouldn't we listen to?"
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.440]   All of a sudden, this very gift of God became a source of contention because it broke up
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   the body of Christ.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:41.800]   That's why, again, in 1 Peter 4, 7, and 8, it says, "The end of all things is at hand.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.320]   Therefore, be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers."
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.240]   He says, "The end of all things is coming, so therefore, you should live as if there's
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.440]   a countdown, there's a clock ticking, that every minute of our lives should really be
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.240]   intentional in what we invest in."
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:05.040]   But he says, in verse 8, "But above all, above prayer, above being self-controlled, being
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:11.680]   sober-minded, above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.880]   sins."
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:23.920]   If we practice prayer, righteousness, reading, theology, devoid of love, all of a sudden,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.480]   all we have are people who are practicing righteousness, pointing out what's wrong
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   with everybody else.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.440]   And let me say it again.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.560]   Pursuit of truth without love always leads to condemnation.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.480]   I'm going to keep saying that so that you're going to remember this after this service.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.360]   Pursuit of truth without love always leads to condemnation.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.840]   And he's teaching this church, above everything that you know about Christianity, above all
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.880]   of that, practice love, because if you do not have love, you will not cover over the
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.600]   sins of others.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.300]   If you've ever studied Corinthians, especially 1 Corinthians, you know that the highlight
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.040]   of 1 Corinthians is chapter 13, right?
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   Even people who don't know, never studied the Bible, they know chapter 13.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.600]   It is a chapter of love.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.760]   It hangs on people's walls, even non-Christian stores, you'll see sometimes chapter 13, you
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.520]   know, 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   It's a beautiful chapter about what love is.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.120]   But just like everything else, you have to understand it in context.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.520]   You can't just take chapter 13, it's a beautiful chapter, and just kind of use that.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.280]   And in and of itself, there's a lot of significance.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.160]   But when you understand it in the context of what Paul has been arguing, chapter 13
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.480]   is a culmination and the conclusion of an argument that Paul's been making starting
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.840]   from chapter 1.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.600]   The problem that the church had is described in this way, "If I speak in tongues of men
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal."
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.160]   Do you think Paul is just talking theoretically?
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.360]   That something like might happen?
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.440]   No, he's talking to the Corinthian church.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.600]   And when he says, "If I have tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.360]   gong or a clanging cymbal," he's talking to a specific problem in the early church.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.920]   And he mentions that later on in chapter 14.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:24.400]   God has given you this gift to speak in tongues, but because you're not practicing in love
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:32.040]   concerned about the other people, all it's producing is noisy sounds and clanging cymbals.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.320]   This is not just some theory.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.040]   He's talking to a problem in the church.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.080]   He says, verse 2, "And if I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.680]   knowledge and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   nothing."
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.800]   I mean, this is the superlative.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.120]   I mean, you can say, "Paul's exaggerating, even if he had prophetic powers."
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.840]   Again, he's not talking theoretically because this is exactly what was happening in the
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.160]   Corinthian church.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.500]   They were tremendously blessed.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.780]   There were prophets in the church.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.380]   There were people who had the gift of knowledge who were prophesying about what God was revealing
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.960]   to them, but they weren't practicing in love.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.000]   They weren't concerned about the other brothers, the weak brothers, the new brothers, the people
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.760]   who had come from the outside.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.880]   They weren't concerned about any of that.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.080]   He said, "I have this gift and I just wanted to use it, and it was causing all kinds of
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.160]   divisions and chaos in the church."
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160]   Consider what he just said.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.580]   I mean, in our generation, if somebody has a PhD in theology, you know, and spent the
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.920]   last 15 years studying, you know, theology, we automatically assume you must know God
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.360]   better than me.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:50.280]   He says if you have all the prophecies, all the knowledge, all the mysteries, even if
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:55.240]   you have faith, I'm going to get to that later on, even if you have that as to remove
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:01.200]   mountains, can you imagine if somebody actually removed a mountain?
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   I mean, the whole world would be flocking to listen to him.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.560]   But Paul says, "Even if you did all of that and you have not love, you are nothing."
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.480]   Again, this is not theory.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.560]   He's talking to a church that was divided, causing all kinds of chaos because these spiritual
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.180]   gifts were not being used to build up the body of Christ.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:28.720]   If I give away all that I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.200]   am nothing because this was causing the problem in the Corinthian church.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:40.920]   Again, all in the context of pursuing righteousness, all in the context of practicing God's gift,
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:47.240]   all in the context of wanting to supposedly do what pleases God.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.920]   And yet they missed the whole point.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.480]   That point was to practice love.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:22:00.000]   That's why in verse 4, it's a description when it says love is patient and love is kind.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.080]   I don't think Paul was just kind of sitting there thinking like, "What is love?"
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.960]   And he's thinking about all the philosophical things and all the beauty of love and just
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.200]   sat there and just jotted these things down.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.760]   I think if there was any book, just humanly speaking, obviously the Holy Spirit is the
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.680]   ultimate author of all of these things, but He used human agents.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.200]   I think Paul probably put more thought into writing 1 and 2 Corinthians than any other
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   letter.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.640]   Maybe Romans, but outside of Romans, maybe 1 and 2 Corinthians because he was grieved
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.400]   over what he was seeing in 1 Corinthians.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.320]   This is a church that he literally almost gave his life to bring the gospel, and then
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.080]   now he sees this chaos, and then now they're questioning his apostleship.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.280]   So he was heartbroken over what was happening.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.000]   So when he says love is patient and love is kind, I don't think he was just generically
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.120]   getting these things out of the sky.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.760]   I think he was probably thinking about a particular person.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.800]   He was probably thinking about a particular circumstance, a particular conflict.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:08.360]   And he's trying to teach this church, if you want to practice this love, love is patient.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.800]   Love is kind.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.840]   Love does not envy.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.000]   It does not boast.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.240]   Maybe the reason why the church was divided was because there was envy.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   They were competing.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.760]   There was jealousy.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.600]   There was one-upping one another.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.960]   It is not arrogant.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.520]   I think Paul is saying that because he's seeing some arrogance in this division.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.320]   He's seeing some envying and boasting.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.280]   It is not rude.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.200]   It does not insist on its own way.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   Wasn't that what was causing this division?
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:47.680]   People who have maybe good intentions could not come to terms with each other.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.160]   It is not irritable or resentful.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.280]   It does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.800]   Why would somebody rejoice in wrongdoing?
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.960]   In the context of pursuing righteousness, and the person who is on the other side, they
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.660]   start to fumble and fail.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.880]   If you don't love that person, it's like, "I told you.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.160]   Look what happened to that guy."
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.920]   You start to rejoice over their failing.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.960]   If you really love, you wouldn't rejoice in wrongdoing.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:26.160]   Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.360]   Love never ends.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.320]   Jesus said to pursue the things that have eternal value.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.360]   Everything that is on earth is going to perish when Jesus comes.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.040]   Our whole life is to be lived to invest in things that we're going to be able to carry
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.440]   with us when he comes to eternity.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:52.440]   He says, "All prophecies, once it has fulfilled its purpose on here, it will end.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.440]   They will pass away.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.880]   All tongues, it is temporary.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.480]   While we're here, it'll cease.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.080]   That's for all knowledge.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.320]   There's no use for it when we get up to heaven.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:10.600]   But love, love that is sanctified and learned and practiced, it will never end.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.040]   That is something eternal that we're going to carry on for eternity.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.200]   All other things, all the theology that we know.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.560]   You can be a PhD.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.200]   When you get in the presence of this holy God, all of that stuff is going to just go
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.360]   out the window.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.280]   Because now you have a first-hand view.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.600]   And so much of our knowledge of God is going to seem so elementary when we're in the presence
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   of his glory.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.520]   All the spiritual gifts, all the disciplines, all the stuff that we have achieved, when
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.760]   we get into the presence of glory of God, you're not going to be wrestling with your
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760]   flesh.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.840]   I mean, you're going to want to give him the glory.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.960]   And you're going to beat yourself on the head thinking, "Why didn't I notice this earlier
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.680]   if God is this good?"
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.480]   All of this is going to pass when he comes.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.240]   But love, love will never end.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   Love is going to continue.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.560]   You're going to invest it in here, and you're not going to regret it when you get there.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:13.320]   That's why Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13, 13, "So now faith, hope, and love abide, these
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.560]   three, but greatest of these is love."
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.080]   Think about what Paul's been saying for 11 chapters, that salvation is by faith and by
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   faith alone.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.560]   The righteous shall be saved by faith.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.920]   Without faith, we don't have God.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.160]   Without faith, we don't have forgiveness.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.080]   Think about the importance of hope.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.960]   Without hope, we can't persevere.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.000]   Our tomorrow, no matter how dark it gets, we are able to persevere and make it because
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   of hope.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.120]   Think how important faith and hope is.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:52.060]   He says, "They abide, but of them love is the greatest."
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.560]   Love is our goal.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.560]   Love is our purpose.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.240]   Love is what we are pursuing.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:03.800]   In 1 Timothy 1.5, Paul tells Timothy, this young man, to go back to Ephesus and command
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:08.480]   these men who are teaching false doctrines to stop preaching the false gospel.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.560]   He was giving Timothy authority as the apostle of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, authority
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.200]   to go and stand up for the truth.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.040]   But he wanted to make sure that Timothy didn't get carried away, that he was going to practice
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.360]   righteousness without grace.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   So he qualifies his command by saying in chapter 1 verse 5, "The aim of our charge is love,
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith."
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.880]   He's calling Timothy to fight.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.160]   But in this fight, he says, "Don't forget, the goal of this fight is to love."
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.680]   The reason why you need to judge is to love.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:48.280]   The reason why you need to stand up ultimately is for the purpose of love.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.760]   Test of truth without love always leads to condemnation.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:00.200]   Because all it does is truth is like a flashlight that we put on everybody to see if they're
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.120]   going to pass this test.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:08.100]   But the bottom line of the gospel is nobody passes this test.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.760]   Nobody passes the test of truth.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.360]   Nobody.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.400]   The only reason why you and I are here is because we've been covered because we were
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.280]   all failures of this test.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.640]   So if we pursue truth without love, it only leads to condemnation.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.080]   Romans 14, 17, "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.920]   righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.800]   In other words, Paul is saying it's not about eating or drinking.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.080]   It's not ultimately about rule keeping.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.320]   The kingdom of God is about peace and righteousness and joy.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.280]   This is not a new command in the New Testament.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.880]   It's not all of a sudden God had one way of dealing with people and then comes a New Testament
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.520]   and he introduces something brand new.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:01.080]   He says the same thing in Hosea chapter 6, 6, "For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice,
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.000]   knowledge of God rather than burnt offering."
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.160]   Why does he say that when he's the one who commanded them to give sacrifices?
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:17.440]   We've been studying Leviticus and the burnt offering was commanded to be given every single
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.840]   day morning and night.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.840]   Why does he say it?
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   Did he change his mind?
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.760]   All of a sudden he said, "No, I don't want these burnt offerings.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.000]   I don't want these sacrifices."
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.160]   No.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:34.840]   Hosea is one of the few prophets who was sent by God before Israel went into exile.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.520]   So we call them pre-exile prophets.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.520]   Hosea was one of them.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.520]   Amos was one of them.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.000]   Isaiah was one of them.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:50.680]   And in those prophets, it gives the same warning to Israel that they are busy giving many sacrifices
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:57.240]   but they were just noisy gongs and clanging cymbals to God.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:04.200]   Because in it, they were neglecting or ignoring the weightier matters of mercy and grace and
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.400]   love to the orphans and widows.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.120]   And so God says your burnt offering means nothing.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.360]   It's empty.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.160]   This is not a new teaching in the New Testament.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.320]   This is what God's been telling them all along.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.840]   The purpose of all of this is love.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.060]   Romans 14.8, "For if we live, we live to the Lord.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.480]   If we die, we die to the Lord.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.120]   So then whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's."
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.740]   In other words, you can glorify God in life.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.600]   You can glorify God in death.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:43.280]   You can glorify God by eating or not eating, by being sick or being healthy, by living
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.400]   long or short, by being rich or poor.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.320]   Because the whole purpose ultimately is to honor and glorify God.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.640]   The kingdom of God is not about eating or drinking.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.000]   It's about peace.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.880]   And what brings God the most glory is when we reflect Him.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.320]   And what is it about Him that we are to reflect?
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.520]   Jesus said that very clearly.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.120]   If you love one another as I have loved you, then they will know that you are my disciples.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.040]   So if there's one character that's going to glorify God above everything else that we
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.080]   pursue, He says it's love.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.720]   So the first thing we are to judge, to build, and not to condemn.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:33.800]   And again, the second point is really the same point, but I want you to stay with me.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.240]   Walking in love means to consider others first.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   Walking in love means to consider others first.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.720]   Romans 14, 15, it says, "For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   walking in love.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.280]   By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died."
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.800]   Again, Paul is not calling us to relativism.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.320]   Paul makes it very clear what his opinion is.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.840]   In verse 14, he says, "I know, and I'm persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:06.200]   in and of itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it is unclean."
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.640]   We talked about, I'm not going to get into that this morning because I've already talked
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:15.080]   about it, that the weaker and the strong brother, he says he's strong, and the weaker brothers
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.280]   are the ones who are taking their time transitioning into the new covenant.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:25.400]   And so he's asking the church to be gracious and be conscious in the context of pursuing
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.640]   Christ, not to be divided over this eating or drinking.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.960]   Paul goes even further than that, and not simply to say, you know, to be concerned about
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.200]   their conscience.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   In Philippians chapter 2, 3 to 4, Paul said, "Do nothing from rivalry or conceit."
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.200]   Do nothing.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.520]   "But in humility, count others more significant than yourself.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:52.040]   Let each of you look not only for his own interest, but also to the interest of others."
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:58.360]   Whenever we read something like this or 1 Corinthians 13, it sounds beautiful, right?
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:04.080]   Jesus is the perfect example of somebody who had the highest glory and emptied himself,
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.560]   became nothing.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:10.740]   And we look at that and we admire that, we sing about it, we share about the love of
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.600]   Christ and how awesome it is.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:19.640]   But as we draw near to God and God commands us to practice that, I say, "Are you kidding
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   me?"
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:25.140]   I mean, we want to honor you and want to thank you for what you did, but you don't really
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.160]   expect us to practice that.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   And we don't practice it.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.560]   I mean, humanly speaking, our natural instinct is to survive.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.280]   And in order to survive, we have to be selfish.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.480]   We have to look out for us.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.800]   The house is burning, we're going to run out, right?
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.240]   I mean, even on the airplane, it says, "Well, you survive first.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.520]   You put the air, oxygen on, and then you take care of your kid."
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:54.280]   And obviously, we know that there's wisdom in that, but it's our natural instinct to
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.240]   look out for ourselves.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:02.200]   We don't teach our children to go to school and say, "Everybody's better than you."
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.520]   We wouldn't tell them that.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.760]   If your child comes home and say, "Somebody bullied me."
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.360]   It's like, it's okay, because they're better than you.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.920]   Consider them better than you, right?
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.580]   We would never tell them that, even when we tell them to share, right?
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.680]   They have to eat and then you have this, "Oh, okay, you don't need all of it."
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.360]   So you take what you need and the stuff that you don't need, you share with other people.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.880]   So that's being a good parent, teaching them how to share, but you're not going to say,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.360]   "Don't touch any of that.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.360]   Give it to them."
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.360]   "Oh, but I'm hungry."
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.040]   "But they're better than you.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.040]   Give it to them."
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.320]   We would never teach that.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.820]   We don't even value that.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:49.280]   So it's beautiful to read, to hang on the wall, but to practice this, to make decisions
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.960]   because it benefits them, even at my own harm, but yet that's exactly what he's called to
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.780]   do.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.000]   And that's what agape love is.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.960]   And Jesus said that the greatest love is to lay down his whole life for his friend.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.220]   Jesus' love goes even beyond that, because he laid out his life for enemies.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:16.360]   We can celebrate that, we can admire that, we can sing about that, we can worship that,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.520]   but the Bible tells us to practice that.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:27.600]   If there's one command that will filter nominal Christians and genuine Christians, it's this
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.920]   command.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:36.400]   This is not something you can do in the flesh, because it is not in us.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.720]   We don't value this.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   We'll celebrate it from a distance, but we would never practice this in our flesh.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:51.360]   If there's any commandment, if there's anything about Christian discipline that divides between
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.280]   lip service and genuine worship, it's this.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:02.020]   Because only an individual who has experienced this love can practice this love.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:08.140]   Only an individual who understands that he failed the test, that he was the weak brother,
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.620]   can ever even think of practicing this.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.500]   This divides the church.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.320]   This tests the church to see who is real and who is not.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.320]   This is the test.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.540]   This is the litmus test of an individual who has seen the glory of the gospel in Jesus
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.960]   Christ and has broken over his sins, and as a result, he lives a reasonable life, offering
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.100]   his body as a living sacrifice.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:38.280]   You can know theology without practicing this.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.380]   You can avoid the world and live an aesthetic life.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.380]   Even Buddhists do that.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:49.640]   You can be very disciplined without practicing this.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:56.200]   You can read tons of books and know all the answers and be the best counselors, and yet
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.100]   not practice love.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.620]   And at the end of your life, it was all for nothing.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:10.320]   This you cannot practice until you have not only seen it up close, until you've experienced
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.320]   it yourself.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:17.880]   And that's why Paul says, "The love of Christ consumes me.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.440]   It compels me to do what I do."
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.760]   The reason why he doesn't walk away from this church, the reason why he doesn't burn this
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.700]   bridge is because he's been affected by the love of Christ.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.480]   This is not something we can do in our own flesh.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:40.880]   Ultimately, what Paul is calling us to do is to do exactly what Jesus did with us.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.880]   Romans 8.26 is, "Likewise, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.460]   For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.200]   us with groaning too deep for words."
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.400]   How many of you struggle with praying and not knowing what to pray for?
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.200]   I've never met anybody who didn't struggle with this.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:08.920]   And I've met some prayer warriors, you know, in the 30 years, 30 plus years that I've been
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.460]   a Christian, I've met some prayer warriors, but I've never met anybody who didn't struggle
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.460]   in prayer.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:17.520]   He says, "The Spirit helps us in our weakness."
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.880]   He saw our weakness and he didn't say, "You know what?
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.360]   I've given them enough.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.520]   I've erased their sins and do you want more?"
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.920]   He said, "God knew we were going to struggle in prayer and in our weakness, he came and
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.240]   covered us and gave us the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.920]   Even when we didn't know what to pray, the Holy Spirit is interceding on our behalf,
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   groaning.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:44.480]   There's prayers being offered to his children constantly, whether we know it or not.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.960]   The Holy Spirit is interceding.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.680]   He saw our weakness and he didn't walk the other way.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.880]   He saw our weakness and he didn't condemn us."
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:58.400]   If Jesus practiced truth without love, you and I would not be here.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:03.440]   If he looked at us to see who was weak and who was strong and he drew near to condemn
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:08.360]   the weak and strengthen the strong, we would not be here.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.560]   All he's doing is telling us to practice what he did with us.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.140]   Hebrews chapter 4, 15 to 16, "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:22.240]   with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.520]   sin.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.240]   Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.000]   and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.640]   Not only did he see our weaknesses and then not run the other direction, he came and he
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.040]   took on our weakness.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.040]   He sympathized.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.040]   He walked among us.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.280]   He was humiliated.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.600]   All for what purpose?
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.680]   To draw weak people to himself.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.480]   So that when he says, "Come," that we would not be afraid.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.740]   That we would not be trembling in fear when he says, "Come."
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.900]   Because we were weak.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.960]   If we were strong, he didn't need to.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:10.460]   See, only an individual who has been deeply affected by the love of Christ can practice
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.460]   this love.
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.460]   You can love your children.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.460]   You can love your husband.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.460]   You can love the world.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:19.820]   You can love like the world loves, but the love that Jesus practices can only be practiced
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:25.780]   if you've been a recipient of that grace.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.140]   You see why this is central to the church?
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.340]   Central to our worship?
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:36.700]   That's why he says, he sums it up in Romans 14, 18, 19, "Whoever thus serves Christ is
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:43.240]   acceptable to God and approved by men."
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:49.840]   It is this that causes Christ to look at us and say, "He is approved."
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:57.160]   So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:05.380]   As we contemplate and think this morning, this afternoon, what is it are we pursuing?
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:10.620]   Especially those of us who are busy, whether it's being disciplined and doing the right
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.860]   thing and serving and evangelizing, memorizing scripture, and all of these things are great.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.320]   Every Christian should be propelled to do that.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.700]   But never forget what Paul says to Timothy.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:26.600]   The aim of this commandment is love.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.820]   If love is not our pursuit, if love is not the glue that brings us together, if love
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:35.940]   is not the reason why we fellowship, persevere, are kind and patient with one another, sooner
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:41.200]   or later it will just lead to condemnation.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:47.120]   This morning as we invite our praise team to come, if I can ask the praise team to come.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.900]   We've given this time after the service so that we can, not just so that we can praise,
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.960]   but give you time to respond in prayer.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.500]   So they're going to give us some time to pray and then they're going to lead us in the main
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.640]   part of worship.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.280]   I really want to encourage you, if there's anything that we need to practically apply,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   it's this.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:11.920]   Because there's not a single person in this room where this does not apply.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.460]   You may be oblivious.
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.500]   You just need somebody to remind you.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:24.560]   But there's not a single person in this room where this does not apply.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.680]   Not to simply be hearers of the word and say, "Well, okay, that's great.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:33.380]   That's another beautiful thing that we've been reminded about the love of Christ."
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.700]   And to not to admire God from a distance.
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.800]   Worship God from a distance and watching him from a distance and say, "Wow, that's great.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.240]   That's awesome."
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.640]   Never drawing near to God.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.960]   The whole purpose of salvation was to open the door so when he says, "Come," that we
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.560]   would come, come to him.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:02.920]   As you recognize that there are aspects of our lives that we practice truth without grace.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.640]   We practice truth without love.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:10.240]   That we would come before the Lord in very specific application.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.800]   That we would reflect his glory.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:20.140]   If you've been affected by the love of Christ, respond and bear fruit to practice what he
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.140]   did with us.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.600]   And that by doing so, that we would bring glory to him.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.360]   So let's take some time as our worship team leads us to pray before God.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.640]   And if you're not aware, to be very specific and come before the Lord, "Lord, soften my
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.400]   heart.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.840]   I've been practicing truth without love.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.460]   Give me the grace that I need to reflect him."
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.940]   So let's take some time to pray and to apply as we take some time to come before the Lord
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:46.940]   and worship.
