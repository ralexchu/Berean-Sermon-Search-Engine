[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   So, it's kind of loud. Can you lower the volume? No? Okay, cool.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Alright, so, thank you for coming on time.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   We're going to get started because even though we're only covering about two chapters, it's a lot of material.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   So, we want to just get right into it and start this study.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   So, let's begin with a word of prayer and then we'll start.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Father God, we thank you again so much for tonight and just allowing us to study your word
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   without any pressure from the world of any kind of persecution or what not.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   We thank you that you have given us your word that through it we may understand more of who you are
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   and what you have done for us. We thank you so much that you have given us the Gospel of Mark,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   that through the Gospel of Mark, Lord, we're able to understand better and more deeply, Lord God, our Lord and Savior.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And I pray, Father God, that the study of your word would truly transform our lives, our minds, our hearts,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   so that, Father, we may be more inspired, Lord God, to live out our lives in faith.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I pray, Father God, that as we begin our study, that you will give all of us attentive minds and hearts, Lord,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   to be able to just really understand the text and to find ways to apply it in our lives, Lord.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And that, Father, that the study of your word will not simply end with us, but, Father, may it be transferred over, Lord God,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   to someone else, perhaps a non-believer who does not know Jesus Christ or perhaps a believer who is in need of encouragement.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We pray, Lord God, that the study of the Gospel of Mark would accomplish that.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And so, God, I pray for much fruit to come forth from not only tonight's study, but for the studies ahead.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And that, Father, ultimately this would be used to glorify you.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So, God, we thank you, and in your name we pray. Amen.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Alright.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So, just very briefly, we're going to do a little review here.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And the review basically is, we're going to, you know, we have a three-fold purpose of the Gospel of Mark, and that's found in verse 1.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   The first purpose is to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Secondly, to teach that Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And thirdly, to present Jesus as the servant of God.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   That's pretty basic. We've gone over it.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   But again, this is something that I really want to press onto you guys as much as I can.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   We covered last week a lot of material, but here are some significant hits.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   We covered the battle cry.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   We call that the battle cry because that was when Jesus was baptized and he began his ministry.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Again, remember the veil was, the heavens were torn open as a connection back to the veil being torn
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   when Christ was crucified on the cross.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   We also covered the beginnings of his ministry where he healed many people, he casted demons out of the synagogue.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And also we covered the four offenses of Christ where he offended the religious teachers of the day,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and thus ending with the Pharisees and the Herodians gathering together to plot to destroy Jesus.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Again, very vivid words, vivid language, and Mark is using that so he can make his point.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Again, we covered the outline of Mark.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Again, I thought this was important just so that we can have in our minds just the progress of movement
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   that Christ has with his ministry.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   We notice that in the first 13 verses of chapter 1, Jesus is in Judea.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And then from chapter 1 verse 14 until the end of chapter 9, he's in Galilee conducting his ministry.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Starting from chapter 10, that's when we have a turning point.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   We would call that, I guess, the hinge of the Gospel of Mark where he begins his journey towards Jerusalem.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And then from chapter 11 verse 1 all the way to the end, we see Jesus in Jerusalem
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   where he will ultimately be sacrificed for our sins and will be resurrected from the dead.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And so that's the basic outline. I include that in your notes again.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It may be there next week. I don't know. I have a very short memory, so I don't know.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It might be there next week, but anyways.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   So that's the basic outline of Mark.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Just a brief outlook of what's ahead.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   We're going to cover basically two parts ofâ€”I broke off today's text into two different parts.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   We have the rise of the opposition, and that's from Mark chapter 3 verse 7 until the end of the book,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   or end of the chapter.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And then we have the planting of the parables, and that's from Mark chapter 4 verse 1 until 34.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And so that's basically the breakdown of today's text.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So we're going to get right into it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Oh yeah, if you guys haven't checked in yet, just go ahead and check in.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   You have your names there and stuff like that. It'll be good for attendance sake.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So I can know who's coming and who's not coming.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   All right.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Chapter 3 verse 7 begins with Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and a great multitude from Galilee followed, and also from Judea,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and from Jerusalem, and from Edomaea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   A great number of people heard of all that he was doing and came to him.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And so again, what we see here is Jesus' ministry expanding.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   We see it expanding.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   We have people from nearby region of Galilee.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   We have people coming from Judea and Jerusalem, which is all the way down south.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   So people are traveling this great distance to go see Jesus.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You have Edomaea, which is down here.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Something worthy of note is that that's Judas Iscariot's hometown.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Edomaea is also another name for Edom.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   If I remember you guys from the Genesis Bible study, this would be considered Edom.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   We also have people coming from beyond the Jordan River.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I believe the Jordan River would be somewhere around here.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And Tyre and Sidon, which is up north.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And if you notice that there is no mention of Samaria in this list of this great crowd that's following Jesus.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   There's more seats in the front.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   If you guys could move up front. I won't name names, but I'm looking at you.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So just come up front. Thank you.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I'm looking over there too. Yeah, I see you too.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So come up front.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So again, we have this great mixture of people coming from different areas of Israel.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Some of them coming outside of Israel.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Most of them are Jews.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   All the areas that are listed are heavily populated with Jews.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   But it wouldn't escape our minds if there were some Gentiles that are part of,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   that are coming in and wanting to see what's going on with Jesus.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Oh yeah, I mean there is significance that there's no mentions of Samaritans coming to the crowds.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Mainly indicating the, I guess the spiritual aloofness of that region.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   That they're not aware of the Messiah because they're so caught up with the Old Testament.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Not just the Old Testament, but the Pentateuch in general.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And so they're so caught up with that, that any kind of prophecy about a Messiah was kind of lost on them.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And so I think that gives great accredence to John, I think chapter 3 or 4,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   where he meets with the Samaritan women.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   But again, there's no Samaritans that are coming to see Jesus in this kind of great crowd that's following him.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   So that's something to note of.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So despite the miracles and the teachings that are going on,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   no Samaritans came up to see Jesus.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And another thing is that again, we see in verse 10.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   We start in verse 10, "For he had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed around him in order to touch him."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And we see in verse 11 that he heals people from their unclean spirits.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And so there's a lot of healings going on.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And so all this is to say that within this great crowd, it's becoming more and more dangerous and disorderly.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Mark is using very, again, detailed language depicting how dangerous it was.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   They were surrounding him. They were almost crushing him, pressed around him to touch him.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I don't know if you guys deal well with large crowds. I don't, and I'm a big guy, so I tend to like try to create space.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   But Jesus was surrounded by many people.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And I'll kind of explain verse 9 where he says, "Have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, so that they will not crowd him."
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I guess the image that Mark is trying to portray for us in this section is to show that
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   even though there's a large crowd of people coming to see what Jesus is all about and the healings that he's conducting,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   they really were there just to satisfy their interests and their physical needs.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And nothing was being noted of them actually following Jesus.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And again, that falls in line with his ministry.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Remember in John chapter 6, verse 66, where many of his so-called disciples fell away
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   after Jesus was giving some very strong teaching.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   But, so what we see here again is that even though there's a large crowd of people around him,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   they weren't there for the right reasons.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   They were just simply there to see a spectacle and to perhaps even get healed from their sicknesses.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And so that's something to take note of with this section of the text.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Okay, moving on. Is that okay? Can we move on? Alright.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Next part is called "The Appointment of the Twelve," and that's Mark chapter 3, verse 13 through 19.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And it says, "And he went up to the mountain and summoned those whom he himself wanted, and they came to him.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And he appointed twelve so that they would be with him, and that he could send them out to preach
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and to have authority to cast out the demons."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   And then after that, from 16 until verse 19, is the list of the apostles, or list of the disciples.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And so this is a turning point in Jesus's ministry.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Whereas before, he was just generally teaching and he had general disciples kind of following him,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   but now Jesus has called the twelve. He has called out the twelve to him.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And so this is a turning point in Jesus's ministry.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   He is beginning to see that, you know, he's initiating a new part of his ministry
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   where he could focus on just twelve individuals to pass on his teachings to.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   This appointment by Jesus was not simply based upon merit or ability,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   but it's an appointment motivated by love and service.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   That's something to take note of. We see in verse 13, he says,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   "And he went up on the mount and summoned those whom he himself wanted."
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Again, there's an emphasis on Jesus and what he wanted.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   And they came to him. And in verse 14 it says, "So that," again, the reason why he appointed them,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   "was so that they would be with him."
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And so there's great significance there with Jesus just really loving his disciples.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And it's like part of the reason why he called them out is that he could spend more time with them.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Yes?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   [audience member] I have a quick question on the list of the disciples.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   He listed almost in order of his likes to the very last Judas Iscariot.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Is that something you see or is it just random?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I think the ordering of the disciples is by significance.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Yeah. And so you notice it starts off with the inner three.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Even within the twelve, there was an inner three that was involved with Peter, James, and John.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And then you have the next set of three, which starts off with Andrew, Philip, and Bartholomew.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And you have Matthew, Thomas, and James, and Thaddeus, and then Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   So I think it's in order of significance.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   So yeah, so yes, the answer to your question.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And that's something that's really significant.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Even Judas Iscariot being called to Jesus.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I mean, he wanted Judas to be with him.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   There is a significant affection that Jesus has for Judas.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Even him, you know, even the one who was going to betray him.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And it's a beautiful picture of Jesus' act of love.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   So that he could garner his disciples so that he could be with them.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And so that he could send them out to serve the kingdom of God.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And so something that I was kind of thinking about in practical application is like,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   you know, when we serve the church,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   how often do we think that by us serving the church, we're in fact investing into our relationship with Christ?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   That's something that I was really struck by when I read the text.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   That was something that I realized was causing me to be off balance in my service to the church,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   and in my service to Christ.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Sometimes we serve the church and think of Christ as being our master.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And usually what that results in is usually a burnout.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   You know, we feel so burned out that we can't serve the church anymore.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   But one of the things that this section of the text really reminds us
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   is the fact that when Jesus called us, when Jesus saved us,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and he's calling us to serve the church, he's not just calling us to just serve.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   He's calling us so that we could serve with him.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   You know, this appointment was of love and of concern and care.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And so again, for any service in the church, it's absolutely vital to channel our motivation
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   through this love that Christ has for us.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Again, that's something that Mark really wants to capture in this text.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And so, you know, something to pause and ponder is this question.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   You know, in what ways does your relationship with Jesus Christ
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   affect your service, ministry, or fellowship in the church?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I guess sometimes we can just, again, get so caught up in just serving the church
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   and serving others that we lose sight of the fact that our act of service is really
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   an act of service that's motivated by a relationship, a divine relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And so I think that's something to really consider.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Maybe we can open up for discussion.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Most of us are Asian here, so I don't know if we'll say anything or share anything.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   So in what ways does your relationship with Christ affect the way you serve the church
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   or affect your fellowship?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Not a rhetorical question.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   [pause]
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I mean, if you're really walking with Christ, like, you can't help but have genuine worship towards Him.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And because you have genuine worship towards Him, you're inspired.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I mean, it's a response to, like, your service is a response to your inspiration with Christ.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And so you just become more genuine in whatever you do for the church.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Right.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   That totally is right on.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   That relationship with Christ often gets neglected when we serve.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And I just can't emphasize that enough, that if our own private devotion time with Christ
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   is not so hot or is not doing well, then it's going to greatly affect our service to anyone.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   It doesn't even have to be service to the church. It can be service at work.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And I think that's so important, the fact that we need Christ as our motivation in order to serve the church.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Cool.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Any other thoughts?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   [pause]
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Alright.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Okay, we're going to move on then. [laughs]
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Thank you, Becky.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   [laughs]
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   So moving on.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   [pause]
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Starting at verse 20.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   From verse 20 to verse 35, we're beginning to see the apex of the opposition.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   The apex of the opposition.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And really the pinnacle of the rise of opposition is going to occur in verses 20 to 30.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   What we see first is that it begins with family opposition, right.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   It says that Jesus came home, or into a house,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and a crowd gathered again to such an extent that they could not even eat a meal.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Verse 21, "When his own people heard of this," which could be translated as his own family or friends,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   "when they heard of this, they went out to take custody of him, for they were saying he has lost his senses."
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Or in other translations, he's being out of his mind.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   And so his family from Nazareth, they're hearing all this news about Jesus,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   and they're beginning to say, "Man, this guy's crazy. We need to bring him back home."
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And so the reason why I put another map up here is because I want to show you guys where they were.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Here's Nazareth, the hometown of Jesus.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And they're coming up to Capernaum, which is basically where the majority of Jesus' ministry took place.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And so, as you can see, it's inconvenient for them to go and do this,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   but because of the fame and just the widespread news of Jesus' ministry and his teaching being spread out so quickly,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   they were convicted. They were convicted to bring him back home.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   They felt they were doing Jesus a service by saying, "Here, we're going to take you back home
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   and take care of you so that you're not as out of your mind."
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And so we see that going on, but you have to keep that there because they're traveling,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   so some time elapses over. And we go into verse 22.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   In verse 22, we see the scribes who came down from Jerusalem are saying,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and he cast out the demons by the ruler of the demons."
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Again, right here, this is a tremendous, tremendous accusation that these scribes from Jerusalem are making.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Again, remember the first week, we described Jerusalem as being the scholastic center of Israel, right?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   All the smart people want to go to Jerusalem to study.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And so these scribes from Jerusalem are coming, and they have this proposition, this explanation
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   to explain everything that Jesus was doing. How was Jesus casting out these demons?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   How was Jesus healing the sick?
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And these scholarly scribes come up with this proposition that the reason why Jesus is casting out these demons
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   and healing the sick is because he's possessed by Beelzebul and by the prince of demons.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And so, they make this accusation, and Jesus responds.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Jesus responds by telling them a parable.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And again, this is the first mention of the word "parable" or "parables" in verse 23.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And again, there's going to be a shift now. There's a shift now.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   There's a shift, but in regards to Jesus' teaching ministry.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   There's a shift where he's going to be teaching mainly in parables, and he's no longer making calls to repentance.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Or Jesus is. And so now, he's going to reply back in a parable to them.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And he talks about how can a kingdom stand on its own if it's divided against itself?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And he gives them like three responses to their preposterous proposition.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And then he concludes by saying in verse 28, "Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And whatever blasphemies they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   but is guilty of an eternal sin, because they are saying he has an unclean spirit."
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And so this accusation that Jesus was working in cahoots with Satan
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   really brings up this concept of the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   The blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is broken down into three significant parts.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   The blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is when you have a clear knowledge of Christ and his identity and the source of his power.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   We see that in Matthew chapter 12 verse 28. It's a parallel section with this event.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And Jesus makes it clear. It's like, this is the spirit of God working.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   He made it loud and clear to the scribes that were in the room.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And yet they still made up this accusation that he was working in cahoots with Satan.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   So these scribes already had a clear knowledge of who Christ was and the source of his power.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   So there you go, that's checkmark number one.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   The blasphemy of the Holy Spirit also consists of an intentional rejection of Christ's identity.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And again, we see that when the scribes accuse him of working in cahoots with the devil, with Satan.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And then the third one, maliciously attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to Satan.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And so we see here with the scribes that they had all three lined up against them.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And so in essence, you could say that they committed the eternal sin.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   They committed the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit against the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And so I guess the question that is often asked today is whether or not,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   can people still commit the eternal sin of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit today?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Can people still commit the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit?
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And my answer is yes, people can still commit the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I don't know of anyone who've committed all three of these facets of the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   but it can still happen today where people know who Jesus Christ is,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   they will acknowledge that he is the Son of God, and he is the Savior of the world.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And yet, despite all that, they may still turn around and still say that he still works with Satan.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   So yes, I agree that the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit can still occur today.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Now you might meet people who might just simply say they have a clear knowledge of Christ's identity
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   and the source of his power, and they still reject Christ's identity.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   But does that mean they committed the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit? I don't think so.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Nonetheless, those who don't believe Christ will still suffer the consequences of their sins.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And so in the end, they're going to fall into the same consequences of those
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   who are committing the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit anyways.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   But I think that's something of significance for us to just clarify and to just understand that
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   that the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit still can occur today.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Any questions?
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   [inaudible]
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Yes.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Okay.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   So you're saying I go to three conditions that if fulfilled,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   it would be considered blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which ultimately is the eternal sin.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   That can't be forgiven.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Yeah, it can't be forgiven.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   So are you saying it's more like, because I don't know, what I would think is more than just the utterance of it,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   more than the saying or belief of it, I thought it was more like a state of mind type of thing
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   that's kind of consistent over the duration of an entire life.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Like once you have that thought, it's pretty much always going to be there,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   more than just the mere utterance of it.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   No, I think it's definitely a mindset.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   I think it's a lifestyle.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Usually those who get to the point where they deny Christ that harshly or that passionately,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   they're not going to turn from their ways.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I agree.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   [inaudible]
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   I don't know if that would really be a blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Looking at the context of what's going on here, you have people who are very much aware of the prophecies
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   in the Old Testament, you have these scribes coming up, you have people who are well-versed in the scriptures,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   and yet they still came to this conclusion that Jesus Christ is not the Son of God,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   he is a partner with Satan.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And so, yeah, so if it was someone young and they're saying all these different things,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   I think it would just be maybe a little bit different.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I guess just realistically, I can see the first two things kind of happening with people,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   like us, or just any type of person.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   They go to church early, or their friend goes to church, but they reject Christ's identity as God.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   They might have an understanding and have a knowledge of Christ's identity, but reject that also.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   [inaudible]
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Maliciously means intent, so there's great intent in attributing the Holy Spirit's work with Satan's work.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Alright.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   So, like, I don't know if you've met people, other Christians, who've said that they've thought they've committed
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   This is like a helpful tool to guide them and show them that maybe they didn't.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   I think there was a story with Spurgeon where someone was so concerned that they committed this sin
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   that they weren't able to be forgiven that Spurgeon had to remind them,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   "The fact that you're so concerned about this sin shows that you haven't really blasphemed against the Holy Spirit,"
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   and it calmed them down.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   So, again, you might meet Christians who are questioning this, and they're not sure if they blasphemed.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Rest assured that you can point them to this passage and show them that
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   these are truly the people who have committed the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Do you fit this model? And it's like, "No? Okay."
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   [audience member] What if they mentioned Apostle Paul before he was committed?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Like, how would you explain that?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   [Joseph] If Apostle Paul...
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   If someone comes up to you and says, "Apostle Paul committed this sin, how can he be forgiven?"
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I don't think Apostle Paul really committed this sin. He never really maliciously attributed, like,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan. I think he was just persecuting the Christians.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Um...
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Oh, man, I'm trying to remember right now.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Yeah, I don't think Paul really committed that sin.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Yeah, because there's nothing in there where it shows that he was motivated because he wants to
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   kill these Christians because, "Oh, you know, they work for Satan, and I want to end Satan's rule on Earth,"
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   or something like that. So, I don't really see that in the book of Acts.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   It just seemed that he really just wanted to promote Judaism, and he wanted to go to extremes,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   and he wanted to wipe out the Church.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   So I don't think that it would be right to attribute Apostle Paul as committing this particular sin.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Yes?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   [audience member] Would you say the same for Apostle Peter when he denied Christ three times?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Would I? No.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   No.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   [audience member] I'm sorry to keep on this, but, um, would this be similar to the Ananias-Sapphira?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   No.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   [audience member] And how about the Hebrew 6?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Um, it says, um, I guess, Hebrew 6, 4...
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   [reading from Hebrew 6]
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   [reading from Hebrew 6]
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Right.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   [reading from Hebrew 6]
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   I'll answer that question after class. Yeah, we gotta move on.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   So, yeah. Okay, so I'll get back to you on that one after class.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Alright. Alright, any more questions about the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Have any of you guys ever thought you committed the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit?
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   I know I did.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Praise the Lord for the Gospel of Mark.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Anyways, um, moving on.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   We're gonna conclude this part of the opposition with the family.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Again, after all this happens, Jesus' family finally arrives in verse 31,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and they make a distinction between his mother and his brothers,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   and standing outside, because the crowds are so great, they send word to him and call them.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And the crowd passed along this message saying,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   "Behold, your mother and your brothers are waiting outside looking for you."
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And Jesus replies back, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And looking at those who are sitting around him,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother."
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Again, the main point of this part of the text is just showing
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   that Jesus is delineating a priority between the physical and spiritual family.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   He's showing that his priority belongs to those who obey the will of God.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   He's prioritizing the spiritual family over his physical family.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And perhaps this may have hurt him, perhaps he's probably discouraged
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   at the fact that his family doesn't understand what he's trying to do.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   But nonetheless, he makes his point clear that the priority that he's gonna spend with people
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   are gonna be with those who obey or follow the will of God along with him.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Moving on.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Chapter 4.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Chapter 4, I titled it "The Planting of the Parables."
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   And I think the reason why I titled it that way was because
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   there's just a lot of parables in this chapter that deal with plants.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And so I thought it would be cool to call it "The Planting of the Parables."
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And another reason why that's there is also because, again, there's a clear shift in teaching.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Jesus is no longer making direct calls to repentance.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   He is now teaching the public using parables.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   And this is the first portion of Mark that really emphasizes Jesus' teaching ministry.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And so that's something that we want to take note of.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Okay.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   The first parable that we run into is the parable of the sower,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   which is a little bit misleading because the parable is not really about the sower,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   it's about the four soils.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   So I call it "The Four Soils."
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   So in this parable, we have the sower, we have the seeds,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   and we also have the four soils.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And again, we have the side of the row, the rocky soil, the thorny soil, and the good soil.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Right?
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   All right.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   And so that's that.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I'm going to move on really quickly, guys. Is that okay?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   All right.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   And so he gives us a parable of the soils, and then starting in verse 10,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Jesus is alone with his disciples, or the twelve and his followers,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   and he began asking them about the parables.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   And Jesus was saying to them, "To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   but those who are outside get everything in parables."
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And so basically, and then he quotes from Isaiah chapter 6, verse 9 through 10,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   basically explaining why parables are being used.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And the reason why they're being used is because of Israel's spiritual blindness.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I quoted Hebert from his commentary in Mark,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and it's basically stating the purpose of these parables, and it's,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   "Christ's parables serve to veil the truth concerning the kingdom, as well as to unveil it,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   depending upon the attitude of the hearer towards him."
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And we see that when he quotes from Isaiah,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   saying that, "While seeing, they may see, but not perceive,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   and while hearing, they may not hear and not understand,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   otherwise they might return and be forgiven."
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   So it really is dependent upon the person who hears the parables,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   whether or not that truth will be veiled or unveiled.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   But to his disciples, but to Christ's disciples, he chooses to unveil it for them,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   to unpack the parable for them.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   And so, we can move on, right?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Okay.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   And so what we see in the first soil is, obviously,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   he explains that, well, the seed is the word, right?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   That's what he says in verse 14.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And then in verse 15, he describes the first soil,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   and he talks about how the seed that's been casted beside the road,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   And so, again, Jesus is emphasizing here that there's not much time given for the seed to grow.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   It's just immediately snatched up.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Or, I guess, in other translations, it's described as immediately devoured.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Satan works in very, very quick ways.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   In this context, in this soil, he just moves right in and takes it away.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   The second soil, again, so this is something I just noticed today,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   it was saying that, you know, it starts off with, "In a similar way,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   these are the ones on whom the seed was sown in the rocky places,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   and they have no firm root in themselves, but are only temporary.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Then when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away."
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And so, Jesus kind of already setting the table up to describe the result of the second soil
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   by relating it to the first soil.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   We see that immediately the seed, there's a reception of the word,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   there's joy, immediate joy in receiving the word.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And just as fast as it goes up, it comes down.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   And he brings about, there's a taking away of that seed when persecution arrives.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   In some translations, they describe it as,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   "When affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they were offended."
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   So it's as if, like, they weren't expecting to be persecuted.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Or, "When suffering was demanded because of their faith, they didn't like it, so they just fell away."
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   In the Gospel of Luke, in this same account, a word is used to describe this as apostasy.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   There's a falling away.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   The third soil is, "They heard the word, but the worries of the world chokes the word out."
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And that's pretty basic.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   And in the fourth soil, what we have there is the good soil, and the seed produces fruit in accordance to the word.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   And I'm sure most of you guys have wrestled with this text and have asked this question, right?
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   So which soil represents the genuine believers?
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Which soil represents the genuine believers?
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   I remember when I was in youth group, I was taught that, you know,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   definitely not the first soil, definitely not the second soil, but
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   possibly the third and the fourth soil represents the genuine believers.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   However, the one thing that the third soil does not contain,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and again, what I would now view it as not being saved,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   is the fact that there's no fruit, there's no bearing of fruit.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   And that's the key component that differentiates the fourth soil with the other three soils,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   as some of you guys may already know.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And so, what we have here is like a grid, a grid of how we can view
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   who are genuine believers and who are not.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   And that's something to consider.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Not just for ourselves in discerning, like, you know, maybe my non-Christian,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   maybe my friend who claims to be a Christian, but doesn't really live a life like a Christian,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   not only on top of that, but I think it also helps us understand how we need to pray.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   How we ought to pray for non-believers, and even those who profess to be Christians, but maybe are not.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   I know there's a lot of times where I share the gospel with someone,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   and, you know, it looks like they may respond pretty positively,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   but the next day I talk to them and they just like, you know, they just kind of lost interest.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   And it's kind of sad, I mean, if I was going to categorize, I think I would categorize that under the first soil.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   And so it helps me to pray, you know, especially when we're evangelizing,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   to really pray and ask God, like, God, like, you know, don't allow this seed, this word, this gospel
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   to be planted into this person's heart and not have it be like the first soil,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   where Satan immediately comes and takes away that gospel.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Or even the second and third soil, we pray for the fourth.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And so, again, I think this parable really helps us in understanding that,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   and clarifies for us how we ought to pray as we evangelize.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Any questions?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Alright.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Responsibility hearers. That's Mark chapter 4, verse 21 through 25.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   I had a hard time understanding why this was placed here, and so,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   and the understanding that I got from the study of this part of the passage was the fact that
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Jesus is now changing subjects and he's focusing on those who are hearing the gospel,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   who are hearing the teachings of Jesus, and what is their responsibility.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And so, Jesus is saying to them, the disciples,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   "A lamp is not brought to be put under a basket, is it? Or under a bed?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand?
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, nor has anything been secret but that it will come to light.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   And he was saying to them, "Take care of what you listen to.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   By your standard of measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given you besides.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   For whoever has to him, more shall be given, and whoever does not have,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   even what he has shall be taken away from him."
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And so, again, the emphasis is the fact that what these disciples are learning from Jesus at this point,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   about these parables, were not designed to be kept to themselves,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   but it was meant to be distributed as the teachings of Jesus.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   That's the responsibility that the hearers had.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   And just like you, or just like me, we're all considered hearers of the word.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   This is a personal call to responsibility for those who read the word of God.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Again, we might just read over this and be like, "Okay, like, okay, a lampstand not to be brought to the basket.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Okay, yeah, that's true. Like, a lamp is meant to be put on, you know, it's supposed to be put on display."
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And so Jesus is making it clear, like, to those who are hearing, you guys have a responsibility with these teachings.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   And basically, you know, we could sum it up as this, "The more one applies the truth given from the word,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   more capacity will be given to understand more truth."
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   And so, as we understand the word of God more, as you understand the gospel of Mark more,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   again, I'm hoping, I'm praying that the spirit will work within you guys to really take this Bible study and apply it to someone else.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   You know, lead someone else through this book study, whether it be a Christian or non-Christian.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   I'm really hoping that we can all be responsible as hearers of the word of God to apply this.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   And I think it will pay rich dividends for you, as it did for me, as we just continue on with our study of the gospel of Mark.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   So, again, making a little plug for the optional project in this class, but I'm hoping that some of you guys will find someone to go over the gospel of Mark with someone else.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Any questions?
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Alright.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   We're almost winding down here.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   The next parable is the parable of the seed, or the seed's growth.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   We see that in Mark chapter 4, verse 26-29.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   And the purpose of this is to focus our attention upon the kingdom of God's growth.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   How is the kingdom of God going to grow?
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   And this particular parable is only distinct in the gospel of Mark.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   So you won't find this in Matthew or Luke or John.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   This is only found in the gospel of Mark.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   And the point of this parable is the fact that the kingdom of God is going to grow in ways in which man cannot explain.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   You know, there are a lot of programs that try to promote church growth.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   You gotta have this program in your church in order to make your church grow.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   You gotta have this. You gotta have that.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   And, you know, it might be true, but from what I read in this parable,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   there's no surefire way to grow a church.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Only God can grow his church.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   And so, we can't explain how this church grows.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   One of the things I like about Berean is like, we make mistakes.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   We make mistakes on Sunday mornings. We make mistakes at Bible studies.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   There's technical difficulties and whatnot.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   And usually people might be turned off by that.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   And yet, God has blessed our church so much.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   And have you guys oversee those technical difficulties and whatnot.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   And again, I think that attributes the fact that God is the one that's causing the growth of our church.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   And so again, the parable of the seed is really to show the disciples and to show us that there really is no
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   explanation for the growth of the church other than what we find in the Word of God.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Parable of the mustard seed, again, the point of this is it's small beginnings of God's kingdom on earth
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   and its stupendous growth.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   We see that the kingdom of God is gonna come in as something small, a band of 12 disciples.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   And we come to centuries later and now we still have the church and it's grown so much.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   And for those who are curious, there's a little Old Testament quote at the end of this parable
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   talking about the birds of the air.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   And you could cross-reference that to Psalm 104, verse 12, Ezekiel 17, 23, 31.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Ezekiel 31, verse 6, and Daniel chapter 4, verse 12.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   And basically, that's all in reference to Gentile nations being part of the kingdom of God.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   And so these birds of the air that are nesting in the mustard tree that has now grown to be so large
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   is really Christ's indication that Gentiles will be admitted into the kingdom of God.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   And I believe we're all Gentiles here, since we all love eating pork.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   So, praise God for that.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   For the fact that Gentile nations are admitted to the kingdom of God.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Anyways.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Alright.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Moving on.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Mark chapter 4, verse 33 and 34 is just a summary of Jesus' parable ministry.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   From here on out, we don't hear any more parables in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   And so this is it.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   But we know that there are other parables given.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   And we find that in the other Gospels.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   But yet again, Mark's point in his Gospel is not to emphasize his teachings, but to emphasize his acts of mercy.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Right? Because his audience is to the Gentiles.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   And so he wants to emphasize and prove that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   And by doing that, he's going to focus more on his acts, and not so much on his teachings.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   And so we know that Jesus taught a lot of parables.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   This picture is the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   And yet, this is where Mark ends Jesus' teachings concerning parables.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   And again, something that's really interesting is that he spoke to the crowds using parables,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   but he used illustrations that the crowds knew.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   And we see that in verse 33, with so many such parables, he was speaking the word to them so far as they were able to hear it.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   And so again, he took in mind of the crowds around him so that he's able to teach them these parables
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   using illustrations that they may know.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Alright.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   And so in conclusion, we talk about the rise of the opposition.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   You have the family coming up, and they're opposing Jesus.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   You have the scribes from Jerusalem coming to oppose Jesus.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   And then you have the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit by these scribes from Jerusalem.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   And then you have Jesus' parable ministry, and then only four or three of these parables are mentioned in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   Alright.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   So, we'll conclude here with, if you guys have any questions or encouragements,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   maybe something that you've read in the Gospel of Mark that encouraged you.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   I didn't get to read everyone's comments from last week.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   I'll get it to you guys, hopefully next week. Yes.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   You can email it, or you could submit it.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Oh, no, no. I want it every week. Yeah.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   [inaudible]
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   I don't think so.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   I honestly think that Mary went along partly because,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   if you notice in the text, Joseph is not mentioned.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   Joseph is not mentioned in this track from Nazareth to Galilee.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   And I think the reason why is because Joseph is already dead.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   Joseph died already, and so I think Mary went along because, you know, the whole family went.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   And I don't think she really doubted the works of Jesus.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   I think she understood why Jesus was doing these things.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   I think it was more the brothers that were in opposition to Jesus,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   possibly putting a bad name, you know, to their family.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   So I think Mary went along because she didn't want to be left at home alone.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   So I think so. I don't know.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   I mean, it's pretty, I mean, I don't know.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   It's like, dude, like, she met an angel, you know.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   So I think she has a deep understanding of what Jesus was trying to do, or was doing.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   So I don't think Mary opposed her.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   Him.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Cool. Does that answer your question?
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Alright.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yes.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   So, you know how you said that he spoke in parables to separate, like, you know, like those who believe from those who, I mean, like, because of his real blindness.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   And then he had to explain, like, the parable to the disciples.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   Then how come the disciples didn't understand the parables? Why did he have to explain them to them?
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   So the lay person in the crowd who's hearing the parable, how would he have understood what it meant if he had to explain it to, like, his own disciples?
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Right. I think, um,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   I think even the disciples had to be explained to.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   And the fact that Jesus explained the meaning of the parables to his disciples is significant.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   You know, this explanation of all these different parables
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   only occurred with the disciples.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   You mean, like, understand it right off the bat?
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Yeah, because if they're really, like, the whole point is, like, if you're really, you know, know, like, then you'll understand it, like, right?
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   So then why would he have to explain it to his own disciples?
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Like, even he said, like, how come you don't understand?
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   You know, why do I have to explain it to you, but I'll explain it to you.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   So why did he have to explain it if they're really disciples, wouldn't they just know?
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Because isn't that the point when he was, the point of why he was talking to them?
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Well, I think they were, I think they were just like the rest.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   I think they were spiritually blind as well.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   It's just that Jesus had to, um, because they were his disciples, he had to teach them what these parables meant.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   And again, we see, um, in verse 21 to 25, the responsibility of the hearers.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   You know, if they're held responsible to pass on the teachings of Jesus to other people,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   then they need to be equipped, and they need to know what are the meanings of these parables.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   And so I think that's the reason why, one of the reasons why Jesus, um, took the time to explain to them,
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   even though, you know, we see in verse, um, verse 13, do you not understand this parable, how we understand all the parables?
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   And so I think part of it was to unveil it to them, and part of it too was also to, um, equip them,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   um, to be able to dispense this teaching to others.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   Yeah, okay, we'll talk more later. Yeah.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   Any other questions, encouragements?
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   I am really emphasizing the encouragements, guys.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   I want to hear what you guys think about the Gospel of Mark.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Maybe I'll just get it from your observations.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   Can I ask one more question before we go?
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   You know, like, when he names his disciples, how he changes Peter's name,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   and it also says how he changes John's name to Glen, Glen, or something like that.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   Son of Leonard.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   Is there significance to that name change?
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Because I know he mentioned Peter's name later, like, as the rock on the spot, on the building.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Yeah, um, I think the Sons of Thunder is just a reference to John and James' tendency to get angry.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   But it's not in reference to anything else?
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   Because you know how, like, usually when someone's name is in the Bible,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   it's more like to kind of, you know, like when Eliam, or something like that.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   Right, right, right.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   So there's no other significance to their name?
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   No, I think that was just a--
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   Yeah, I think it was just a name that he gave them to describe who they were.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   I don't think--
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   But it says that he--it doesn't seem to be named any of the--
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   Yeah, he gave the name.
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   Um, I don't know, that's a good question.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   I'll get back to you on that one.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   Any other questions, encouragements?
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   All right, we're going to close then.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   All right, break off into, or grab someone next to you,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   or grab someone that you know who is in need of unveiling the truth, you know.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Someone you think who needs to be unveiled the truth.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   And go ahead and pray with them.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   Share any prayer requests, share encouragements.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   I would really emphasize that, and then we'll close here.
