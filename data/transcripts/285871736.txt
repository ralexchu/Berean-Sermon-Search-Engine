[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   All right, I hope you guys had enough time to be able to look through the passages before
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280]   you came.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.680]   Again, and you're going to hear me say this over and over again, Leviticus is not a book
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.000]   that you can just study casually.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.460]   This is not a book that you can just stroll in in the middle and then hear about the different
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.040]   laws that are going on.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.180]   It will definitely go over your head.
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.740]   This is one of those books that you at least need to know the content, what are the questions.
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.760]   After you read it, what are the tension?
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.820]   What are the problems?
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.820]   What are some issues?
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.820]   What makes sense?
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.820]   What doesn't make sense?
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.420]   And you kind of have to come in with those questioning or else when we begin to expose
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.100]   it, the chances are it's going to go over your head.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.320]   So again, I just want to strongly encourage you at least try to read it, read it thoroughly,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.700]   read it slowly.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.040]   And then so at least you can catch the content of it before you come.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.040]   Okay.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.940]   So we're looking at chapter 18 today.
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.500]   And as you guys know, the primary thing he talks about is the immoral relations.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.580]   And so let me pray for us and then we're just going to jump right in.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.580]   Okay.
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.120]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this evening.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.140]   We pray, Father God, that your word would truly make sense and come alive.
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.180]   That the study of your word would not just be seeking knowledge or putting in our time,
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.860]   but especially Lord Leviticus and the importance of how it connects us to all that you have
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.720]   done in the New Testament, the sacrifice of Christ, what it means to be pure and impure.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.560]   What has required Lord God of sinful people to be in the presence of a holy God?
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.780]   We pray this evening as we discuss the importance of sexual morality and its ramification, what
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.500]   it means and how you view all of this.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.900]   I pray, Father God, for strength, for openness, for tools, Lord God, to be motivated, convicted
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.260]   and strengthened that we may be resolved, Lord, to honor you in this way.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.020]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.020]   Amen.
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.020]   All right.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.440]   So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over chapter 18 in parts, in section.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.400]   The first section that I'm going to be looking at is in verse 1 through 7.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.760]   Okay.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.800]   Where it begins by God calling Moses and telling him, telling the nation of Israel
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.240]   not to adopt the culture or the status of the nation they left in Egypt or in Canaan.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.600]   So Egypt is obviously where they came from and then Canaan is where they are headed.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.800]   This is actually repeated seven times in this passage over, right?
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   Seven separate times.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.320]   It says, "Do not adopt the culture that you are entering.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.040]   Do not look back and imitate where you came from."
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.000]   Because this is a common theme, not only in the Old Testament but also in the New Testament,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.320]   in the New Covenant, our constant challenge is to look back from the culture that we came
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.240]   from and then to look with envy or wherever it is that we are headed, right?
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.440]   So when you're young, when you first become a Christian, there's a lot of baggage that
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.640]   you bring from the past before you became a Christian.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.000]   But after you become a Christian, there's a lot of temptations, especially when you're
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   young.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.680]   You know, when you have money, the temptation is to not, is to be so worried not to lose
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.080]   money, but when you don't have money, your temptation is about the money that you may
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.800]   or may not get if you make certain decisions, right?
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.120]   This is a common theme that we see in the Bible, Ezekiel 20, 18-19, where it says, "I
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.220]   said to their children in the wilderness, 'Do not walk in the statues of your fathers
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.600]   or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.800]   Walk in my statues and keep my ordinances and observe them.'"
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.620]   So over and over again in this text where it says, "Do not live by their standards,
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.620]   but my standards.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.600]   Do not live by their ordinance, but my ordinance," right?
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.520]   So after having said that and having said that over and over again, what is the primary
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.720]   thing that he says not to repeat, which is already in the title, right?
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.760]   He said, "Do not follow their ordinances.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.560]   Do not follow their statues.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.160]   Do not imitate where you are heading," and what is the primary sin in this chapter where
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.000]   he says not to imitate?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.440]   Sexual sin, right?
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.640]   So of all the things about greed, about coveting, idolatry, all of these things are obviously
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.160]   there, but of all the things that he highlights not to imitate, the primary thing that he
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.800]   says is not to imitate their perversion, the sexual perversion.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.720]   So if you've read this chapter, you know, right, especially in our sinful, sexually
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.560]   open culture where almost any perversion you can think of, you probably either heard of
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.840]   it, maybe even seen it.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.280]   But I'll bet you there are certain things in this chapter that you probably didn't even
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.840]   think of, right?
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.720]   The perversion in here.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.600]   So he goes in and says, "Make sure that you do not copy them," but the primary sin that
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.480]   he brings up is their perversion, and he says this phrase over and over again, "You shall
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.760]   not uncover," and it is specifically referring to sexual relations.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.240]   This is repeated 17 separate times.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.380]   You shall not uncover.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.320]   You shall not uncover, right?
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.800]   This clearly is speaking about sexual immorality, right?
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.880]   And why didn't he just say, "Do not commit sexual immorality"?
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.840]   Why does he use the word uncover?
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.160]   Because the word, "You shall not uncover," it covers a lot more than just intercourse.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.840]   You guys are, most of you guys are too young, but many years ago, our former president,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.880]   Bill Clinton, he got caught in sexual relations, and they were interviewing him and said, "Did
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.120]   you have sexual relationship with this young woman, Monica Lewinsky?"
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.520]   And he said, "I did not have sexual relations."
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.680]   Again, you guys are too young to remember this, but he was on national TV, and he denied
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.920]   it many times, and then when it finally, it came out that he could not deny it, they asked
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.080]   him, "Why did you say you did not have sexual relations?"
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.280]   And he basically said, "I did not have intercourse."
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.120]   I'm not going to describe what he did, but he did everything else, but he did not have
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.120]   intercourse.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.360]   So when he said, "I did not have sexual relations," it means, "I did not have intercourse."
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.560]   That's how he explained it.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.080]   And so at that time, there was a big debate, like, "What does it mean to have sex?
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.080]   Can you have oral sex?
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.100]   Is that considered sex?
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.480]   Can you fondle each other?
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.240]   Is that sexual?"
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:04.120]   How far can you go in your sexual encounter, and then say, "No, I didn't have sex because
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.920]   we didn't cross the boundary and actually have penetration and intercourse."
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:17.600]   I know it's graphic, but it's necessary because the term that he uses here to uncover covers
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.980]   any sexual immorality, not just intercourse.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.440]   And that's why this term is used, to describe sexual immorality, because again, when sexual
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.160]   immorality is being rampant, you kind of start to get technical.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.640]   "No, but I didn't actually, right?
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.880]   I didn't actually have sex.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.160]   I didn't actually do this."
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.920]   So even though it talks about sexual immorality, "I never committed adultery because that didn't
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   happen.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.920]   I didn't take it that far."
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.080]   Well, this particular phrase covers that.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:57.700]   Any kind of sexual activity that is inappropriate outside of God-ordained marriage relationship.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:08.020]   So this would include being naked, fondling, touching, anything that you, your wife, your
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:14.060]   spouse would consider inappropriate, anything outside of marriage.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.100]   Again, I'm not going to go through all the lists.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.340]   Just in case there's anyone thinking I'm going to wiggle it, all I did was watch.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.480]   All I did was touch.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   All I did was that.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.340]   This covers all of it.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:36.860]   The ancient Near East cults all contain some kind of cult sexual perversions as a part
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.060]   of their worship ritual.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.100]   You ever wonder why the Israelites were so tempted?
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:49.660]   I mean, they worshiped a God that provided miraculous bread, food, that parted red seeds,
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.580]   performed miracles, had clouds over them.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.460]   And was such a magnificent God.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.380]   But as soon as they forgot God, they ran to these idols.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.080]   What was the attraction of these idols?
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.660]   I have a picture of a couple of these idols that were very popular in the Old Testament,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.220]   and you probably heard their names.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.040]   And it's just, on the surface, it's like, why would you be attracted to that?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.100]   Why was this so tempting?
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.600]   One of the main reasons why the idol worship was so attractive is because there was always
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.580]   some kind of a sexual activity attached to the idol worship.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.000]   Remember the golden calf?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.700]   Why were they so eager to establish the golden calf and worship it?
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:38.500]   Remember when Moses goes up, Aaron creates his golden calf, and he says, "Oh, it just
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   popped out of the fire."
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.600]   This is Yahweh that delivered you out of Egypt.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:54.180]   The golden calf worship was believed to be an influence from Egypt.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.400]   And the bull worship, which promised great fertility if worshipped.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:04.460]   So obviously, even to this day, when you think of bull, you think of power, you think of
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.420]   fertility.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.300]   And so that's basically what their temptation was.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.140]   Because at that time, in order to be rich, you need to be able to reproduce a lot, right?
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.100]   Not just have one or two children, maybe 10, 20, 30 children.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.300]   Your calf, if you're going to have, you know, if you're raising goat or bulls, in order
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.740]   for you to be rich, they need to be very reproductive.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.820]   If you're going to plant seeds, they need to be able to produce well.
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.860]   So you were completely dependent upon whatever it was that you were raising, whatever it
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.180]   was you were planting, to be fruitful.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.320]   And so this calf worship from Egypt basically represented virility.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.620]   That if you worshipped it, the promise was that you're going to be very, very fruitful.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.420]   You're going to have many, many children.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.420]   All your cattle is going to reproduce, like, in a ridiculous amount of number.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:02.100]   So the temptation for the calf worship was a desire to be rich, right?
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.980]   That was the temptation.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.980]   But not only was there a desire to be rich, along with this was, because it represented
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:17.180]   fertility, part of the calf worship ended with orgies.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.800]   And if you look at the New Testament, again, I'm not going to go too deep into the New
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.880]   Testament, but much of the temptation of idol worship in the New Testament was the same.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.000]   That at the end of the worship, there will be some kind of sexual relationship.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.220]   So that's why everyone's talking about the temple prostitution, both male and female.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:39.940]   There's a lot of warning about that because the idol worship and sexual immorality went
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.840]   hand in hand.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:51.700]   The chief male deity was Baal in Canaan, and the chief female deity was Ashtoreth.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:12:00.240]   Both of them, again, represented fertility.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.920]   Baal worship involved licentious sexual activities, which often ended in orgies.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:11.260]   They would get drunk and have what was called sacred orgies to celebrate fertility.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.440]   So sexual immorality was embedded.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.580]   And so, again, if you've read the Old Testament any number of times, you'll know that Baal
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:25.460]   worship was at the center of the temptation that Israelites constantly fell into.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.360]   Asherah was the name of a goddess originated in Assyria.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:36.740]   She was the goddess of fertility that promised health and wealth through sexual perversion.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:42.940]   So you can imagine, again, that the attraction of these idolatry was related to desire for
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.520]   wealth and desire for sex, right?
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.520]   For both.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.780]   I mean, think about the temptations that we fall into.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:58.940]   Again, as a pastor, I can tell you that one of the greatest challenges of leading a church
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:06.300]   in our generation is so many people are struggling with sexual purity.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:12.860]   You can be so committed to God, and then either you get caught in pornography or you start
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.700]   dating and you start having inappropriate relationships, and all of a sudden, your spiritual
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.180]   life is destroyed.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:27.460]   You cannot worship God with a clear conscience if sexual immorality is a regular part of
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.700]   your life.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.700]   You just cannot.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.580]   No matter how much you've compromised it, no matter how much you've justified it, you
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.580]   cannot.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.980]   It absolutely destroys your walk with God.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.260]   I don't care how much time you spend in reading the Word of God, how much time you spend in
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:50.380]   evangelizing or counseling or serving the church or giving, if sexual immorality is
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:57.720]   a regular part of your life, it absolutely destroys your ability to worship.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:03.340]   The other part of it is constant temptation to be rich.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:09.240]   The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and fear of not having enough money
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.660]   or desiring money or having money and fear of losing the money is a constant, because
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.820]   the Scripture says wherever your treasure is, your heart will be.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.300]   So you don't have to have money to seek after money.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.020]   All you have to do is desire it.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:31.260]   So we're not talking about that part of it, but at least the part of the sexual immorality.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.580]   Just how much power it had.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.720]   Those are the actual pictures of Baal on the left, and this is, again, findings that they
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.080]   found through archeology, Asherah.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:51.220]   The pictures of Asherah vary based upon which area of the world that you found it in or
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.400]   what era.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   But most of the Asherah figurines have basically larger breasts representing females and Baal
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.080]   worship.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:09.540]   So in and of itself, physically, what attracted them to this?
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.640]   Why would Israel forsake the living God to worship this?
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.320]   So it wasn't anything physical, what they represented, that if they bow down to this,
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.720]   that the promise was that they're going to be fertile, they're going to reproduce.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.080]   And then the act of worshiping these idols in and of itself was a temptation.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:35.440]   So you get pleasure by coming to it, and then if you come to it, you're promised all these
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.240]   things that your heart's already desired.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.680]   Sexual sin, even in the New Testament, is highlighted above all their sins.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.760]   In 1 Corinthians 6.18, it says, "Flee immorality."
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:55.160]   The word "immorality" in the NIV says "sexual immorality," because the word there is "pornea,"
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.680]   where we get the word "pornography."
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.040]   It's a general word that refers not only to pornography, but in this context, because
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.360]   it's written to the Corinthians, it has the idea of sexual immorality.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.720]   So it says, "Flee sexual immorality."
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:18.640]   Do you remember any other part in the New Testament where it tells you to flee?
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.120]   Where to fight, where to have accountable, memorized scripture.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   But when it comes to sexual immorality, we are told to flee.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.360]   This is not something you mess with.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.560]   This is not something that you say, "You know what?
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.560]   I'm going to try harder this time.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.200]   I don't need accountability because I have willpower."
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.480]   It's assumed that everybody is vulnerable to this.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.360]   So again, I'm going to go off a little bit.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:53.120]   If you are in a constant issue with pornography on the internet, figure out a way to have
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.680]   accountability on your internet.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.000]   It is better for you not to have internet than to be constantly struggling with the
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.840]   same thing.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.840]   But if you say, "You know what?
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:09.720]   I have to have internet," then figure out a way to have some sort of covenant eyes or
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.400]   some sort of accountability.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:17.960]   But you cannot, no matter how much you've compromised, no matter how much you've justified
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:26.200]   in it, you cannot worship God and have sexual immorality as a regular part of your life.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.200]   It is not possible.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.440]   It's a flea sexual immorality.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:36.080]   Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but immorality, man sins against
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   his own body.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.760]   Now, what does it mean to sin against your own body?
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.320]   When you steal, I mean, that hurts other people.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.440]   Typically, when you think of sexual immorality, the reason why people don't take it seriously
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.640]   is because they think it only harms me.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.880]   Other things I do, I harm others.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.200]   If I slander, I hurt other people.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.960]   I murder, obviously, I'm hurting other people.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.320]   But sexual immorality is like, "Well, no one's hurt but me."
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.000]   But here it says, "It's a greater sin because you sin against your own body."
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   So what does he mean by that?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.440]   Is your body more precious than your neighbors, that if you steal from them, but then if you
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.440]   hurt your own body, it's a greater sin?
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.440]   Is that what he means here?
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.560]   If you look at the context of what he is saying, when he says it's a greater sin because you
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.280]   sin against your own body, he's not simply talking about your own body.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.680]   The very next verse says, "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.520]   who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own, for you have been
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.480]   bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your own body."
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.000]   The second part of it in 19-20 is talking about the church.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.880]   Previously, before in verses 16 and 17, he's talking about how we have been united with
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.800]   Christ.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:04.280]   And when you unite your body to a prostitute, he says you are becoming one.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.640]   So when he says, when you have sexual immorality, he's not simply talking about how it affects
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.080]   your body, he's talking about how that affects whatever body that you've also become united
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   to.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.000]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.400]   So he says, how can an individual who has been united together with God, in the Holy
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.840]   Spirit, take that and unite that with a prostitute?
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.640]   Meaning, if you unite that body that had been united with Christ, and you unite it with
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   a prostitute, in a sense you're uniting the Holy Spirit with a prostitute.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.320]   And then, individually, we are one in the body of Christ.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.160]   We've been united together as one.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.000]   So the body here, you, is in plural.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.320]   So when he says sexual sin, in particular, is a greater sin, because we are a part of
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.240]   the greater body of Christ.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.800]   So my sexual sin doesn't just affect you, what does it affect?
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.280]   It affects your body.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.660]   Meaning, whatever you've been united with, it affects the church.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.640]   Even though you think it just affects you.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.640]   Remember what the scripture said, if one hurts, we all hurt together because we are one.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.360]   If we stub our toe, it's not just our toe, it's just a toe.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.520]   He said, no, because we're united, the whole body hurts.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:33.680]   So your sexual sin plays a part in decreasing the quality of fellowship, decreasing the
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:39.480]   quality of witness, decreasing the quality of worship that we can collectively give to
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.480]   God.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:46.600]   That's why he's saying this particular sin is so harmful, because it really erodes the
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   church.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.120]   That's what he means.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.600]   He's not simply saying, it affects you, all other sins it affects other people, but this
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.040]   particular sin affects you more, so it's a greater sin.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.680]   No, the damage is greater.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:07.560]   That's what he's saying.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:14.000]   He says, I am the Lord, and he repeats this over and over again for the purpose of emphasis
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and authority.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.500]   In other words, everything he says comes with authority.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:26.320]   But when God himself places emphasis on his name, it's just like repeating, saying, Peter,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   Peter, Simon, Simon.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.060]   In other words, pay attention.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.520]   What I'm about to say to you comes with great authority.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.020]   It comes with great consequence.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.180]   He says, I am the Lord.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.700]   This expression is a claim of divine ownership.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.820]   In other words, you are mine.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.740]   You are not to do with your body as you please.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.620]   Later on, Leviticus 25, 55, for the sons of Israel are my servants.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.460]   They are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.340]   I am the Lord, your God.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:07.220]   And over and over again, he says to obey my statutes, my judgments, my statutes, verse
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:12.620]   4, verse 5, 26, verse 30, that you are not to follow theirs.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:18.420]   You are not to follow yours, but my statutes, my standards, not your standards, not Egypt's
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.500]   standards, not the Canaanite standard, not what you think is right, but what I tell you
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   is right.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:32.260]   Again, you and I live in a generation where if it feels right to you, why is it wrong?
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.540]   Because our standard of right and wrong is based upon if it bothers you.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:42.820]   So if you hear a particular sentence, if it doesn't gross you out, if it doesn't gross
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.620]   you out, it maybe grossed people out in the previous generation, but it doesn't gross
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.180]   you out because they are trying to normalize certain kinds of sin.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:55.240]   So if it doesn't gross you out, then why is it so bad?
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.440]   And that's a problem that a lot of even Christians have because their certain kind of sexual
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:07.900]   sin has become a normal part of our society that we become weird.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.180]   God's standard has become weird.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.780]   So over and over again, he says, I am the Lord, you are to follow my statutes and my
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.220]   judgments, and he repeats that over and over and over again.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:23.620]   God is the standard of righteousness, not us.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.580]   All of that was the introduction and then verse 6 through 9, and we're going to go over
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.580]   this real faster.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:36.620]   Verse 6 through 9, he's going over various incestuous relationship.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.460]   All of this is an abomination to the Lord.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.580]   And I'm going to go over some of that later on in a chart so you can see it in all one
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:48.580]   page.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:56.620]   He talks about sexual relations between parents and children, parents and stepchildren, between
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.300]   siblings by birth or by marriage, and on and on.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.580]   So just in case you say, you know what, maybe what your child is wrong, what your mom is
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.900]   wrong, your aunt is wrong, maybe your brother.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.380]   So he just goes down the list in case there's any relation, in case anybody is thinking
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.940]   oh, he didn't say this, right?
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.660]   I mean it's almost kind of like he wants to make sure that nobody is looking at these
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.700]   laws and saying well, he didn't say this, so maybe he's okay with this.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:29.300]   So he just thoroughly goes down every relationship you can possibly think of to make sure that
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.220]   nobody wiggles out of it, that all of this is a perversion, an abomination to the Lord.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.860]   It is not just sinful.
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.060]   It doesn't just make you unclean.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:44.620]   It says it is an abomination to the Lord.
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:51.580]   The reason why he does this is because this perversion, this incestuous perversion is
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.100]   very common.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.820]   We may hear it and say, if you've read it, you look down at the list and you say, what,
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:08.300]   with your mom, your dad, your children, your sister, your brother?
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:15.980]   But if you look at and you study and if you've been around long enough, you know that most
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:28.220]   sexual immorality or molestation of any kind usually happens within the family.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.180]   Sixty-three percent of all sexual assaults on females take place within family members.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.860]   Sixty-three percent.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.100]   One in five girls and one in 20 boys is a victim of child sexual abuse.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.740]   And 63% or more usually takes place within the family structure.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.700]   So we may read something like that in chapter 18 and say, oh, that's perverse.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.700]   Which land did that?
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.900]   Maybe the Assyrians, maybe the Canaanites, maybe the Corinthians.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.540]   Sin is not logical.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.860]   Sin is not planned out.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:07.380]   When you are burning in lust, you express it in a way that is the most convenient.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:13.820]   And so that's why it happens in the context of family, because they are the closest.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.460]   It's not calculated.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:24.380]   So when lust is not tempered and you just express it without limit, it gets expressed
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.340]   with whatever is near.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:33.660]   So as perverted as it is, if you live long enough, you know just from experience, from
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.860]   hearing, from counseling, that this is very true.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.980]   So everything that he says here are not talking about some weird groups of people.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:48.620]   This is a description of how far our perversion has gone.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.140]   So when the scripture says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," when
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.580]   he says, "All have sinned," he doesn't describe every single sin.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:04.020]   But chapter 18, he goes into detail of the perversion of sin.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.920]   As a pastor, I can tell you when I was younger, I would say, "Oh, you know, I could…"
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.820]   When you even just a thought of or hearing about it, it's like, "Oh, that's gross.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.780]   That's perverted."
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:21.980]   But after all these years of just talking, counseling, and talking to other pastors,
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.300]   everything that is talked about here in chapter 18, I've heard it.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.260]   I've heard it practiced in some context.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.820]   So this is not some weird thing far away.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.420]   This perversion is inside of us in this room.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.220]   You say, "Oh, maybe those perverted people."
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.940]   No.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.740]   Sexual perversion is inside of all of us.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:47.820]   When we sinned against God, when we are away from the author of life, everything, your
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.460]   idea of right and wrong has been perverted.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.420]   Your sense of justice and fair has been perverted.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.440]   What you consider to be fun, it's been perverted.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.560]   Everything that God has intended has been perverted.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.260]   Our idea of marriage has been perverted.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.700]   Our idea of authority has been perverted.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.920]   Our idea of union has been perverted.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.920]   Everything has been perverted.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.900]   So when Christ came and he redeemed us, he didn't just redeem us so that we wouldn't
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.900]   go to hell.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.340]   He's redeeming everything that's been perverted and bringing us back to what he
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.340]   intended.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.180]   That's what sanctification is.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.700]   Sanctification isn't simply you becoming a better person.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.700]   Sanctification is restoring what got perverted.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.540]   And one of the key things that got perverted is our sexuality.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.540]   Think about it.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:43.460]   At the core of when he created us, he said to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.180]   How are you to be fruitful and multiply?
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.420]   You're supposed to have sexual relations with a man and a woman.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.060]   God created that.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.120]   He made it enjoyable to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.100]   And then when perversion came in, all of a sudden, what God created to give you as a
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.860]   gift, all of a sudden, it became an act of rebellion against God.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:13.660]   At the very core of what he gave us as a gift for our enjoyment and for the purpose of reproducing,
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:24.300]   now the very core of our rebellion is expressed in our sexual perversion.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.500]   The next section, verse 10 through 18, covers anything else that might have been missed
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.300]   in many different family relationships.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:37.980]   So he goes through grandparents and grandchildren by blood, talks about uncles, aunts, nieces,
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:45.700]   and nephews, parents and spouses of their children, siblings and the spouses of their
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.340]   other siblings, children of a spouse, siblings of a spouse.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:57.100]   I mean, he wants to make sure that nothing is left out.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:02.580]   So here's a general chart to cover every relationship.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:08.220]   And this basically covers chapter 18.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.020]   Not only does he talk about the blood relationship, he's talking about legal relationship with
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:18.460]   sister, sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, that all of these things are perversion before
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.300]   God.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.500]   So it's thorough.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.780]   So chapter 18 is thorough.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.300]   God wants us to know that this is an abomination.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.380]   Like in other words, when he says it's an abomination, you know like in the New Testament,
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.460]   he says how he despises a lukewarm church and he says he will spew you out of the mouth?
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.180]   It's like disgusting.
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.500]   So whenever we see the word abomination, it means like God sees the stench and what he
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.460]   sees and he's disgusted, right?
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.900]   That's more of a biblical way of saying God is disgusted with this.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:00.100]   That's what he means when he says abomination.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:08.540]   This is disgusting in God's eyes because again, it is at the core of human rebellion.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:13.940]   The only lawful sexual relation ordained in Scripture is between a husband and wife.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:23.540]   Any other sexual contact is considered an abomination to the Lord.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:30.940]   Think about when there is sexual perversion, which of the 10 commandments, you know how
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.780]   the 10 commandments is broken into two, love God and love your neighbor?
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.820]   The first four is about God, right?
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.020]   Have no other gods, don't make any graven images, don't use my name in vain and keep
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.420]   the Sabbath holy.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.580]   Next six is about human relations, right?
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.980]   Honor your father and mother, do not kill, do not covet, do not steal, right?
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:53.980]   The next six.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:32:03.540]   Which of the six does sexual perversion break?
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:14.020]   Think about it.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.540]   Tell me, what do you think it breaks?
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.540]   Huh?
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.540]   Huh?
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.540]   Commit adultery?
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.540]   Okay, that's one.
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.540]   What else?
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.540]   Thou shalt not covet, right?
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.540]   Because you want something that doesn't belong to you, God didn't give you, thou shalt not
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.540]   covet.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.540]   What else?
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.540]   Okay, you honor your father.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.540]   I mean, clearly you're breaking that in that perversion.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.540]   What else?
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:54.540]   I mean, if you're coveting and then you go after something that doesn't belong to you
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.840]   and you take it, what do you do?
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:05.120]   You steal, right?
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.620]   Does it cover anything else?
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:15.380]   Thou shalt not bear any false witness, right?
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.740]   Clearly you're corrupting the other person in some sense.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.380]   How about murder?
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.100]   We'll get to that.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.820]   He actually even covers that, okay?
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:35.220]   The sexual perversion actually even leads to murder.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.420]   So unlawful sexual relations breaks most, if not all, of the horizontal aspect of the
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.340]   Ten Commandments, right?
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:55.660]   You can make an argument about slander, about gossiping, but pretty much if you give in
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:00.300]   to sexual immorality, it has greater consequences, right?
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:10.340]   It's not just one, it's all of it.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:15.300]   Verse 19 to 23, just in case we missed anything, he goes into further sexual intercourse during
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.900]   menstrual cycle, right?
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.540]   Again, he covers.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:24.340]   This was already covered in Leviticus chapter 15, 19.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.100]   Adultery.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:33.420]   Again, this was repeated in Exodus chapter 20, verse 14.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.140]   Here's one.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:41.780]   In verse 21, he says, "You should not give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech,
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.940]   nor shall you profane the name of your God.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:49.300]   I am the Lord."
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.180]   Everything that he says here is about sexual immorality.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.260]   Why does he bring in child sacrifice?
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.380]   Do you understand my question?
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.060]   The whole chapter is about sexual immorality, right?
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:11.300]   Adultery, having sex during menstrual cycle, homosexuality, bestiality.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.940]   So everything he talks about in chapter 18 is sexual immorality, and yet here he says,
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.140]   "Do not offer your child as a sacrifice."
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:35.940]   Why is that here?
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.620]   The gift of Molech consisted of heating a metal statue representing Molech until it
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.900]   was red hot.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.940]   Then by placing a living infant on the outstretched hands of the statue while beating drums drowned
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.180]   out the screams of child until it burned to death.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.180]   That's what they did.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.940]   Now, why would a parent do that to their kid, right?
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.260]   Even if you're tempted.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:36:02.100]   Again, and why is this here in the context of all the other sexual immorality?
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.820]   Often the infants that were not wanted were discarded in this way, much like modern day
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.820]   abortion.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:13.820]   Basically, if you're going to have rampant sexual immorality, and I'm not saying that
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.540]   all abortion is done for that purpose, if you're going to have rampant sexual immorality,
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:24.860]   you have to be able to discard the consequences of that.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.860]   Unwanted, untimed.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.980]   And so, not all abortion is done for that purpose, but again, this child sacrifice,
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:37.660]   what was the motivating factor behind it was sexual immorality.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.580]   They would go to the temple and have orgies, right?
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.700]   Some of them would have children.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.740]   And then they didn't have abortion pills, they didn't have abortion clinics, so they
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.300]   have to wait until the child is born.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.220]   And when the child is born, how do they discard a child?
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:55.640]   They sacrificed it to Molech, right?
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.540]   So this was related to sexual immorality.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.160]   It's not random.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:07.580]   So we talked about which commandment is broken.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:14.700]   Even murder was related to this sexual immorality.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.820]   Homosexual intercourse, this is something that again, if you're being raised in this
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:26.980]   generation, almost universally, successfully, the world has been convinced that this should
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.600]   be normal.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.240]   This was not so.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.100]   When I was back in high school, Christian or non-Christian, this was not a Christian
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.100]   debate.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:42.880]   It's just like today, if you say, what about child porn?
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.540]   I mean, I don't think anybody, I mean, no one would have the guts to be able to stand
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.880]   up and try to argue that in court.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:55.320]   There was a period in majority of the world, in majority of world history, where arguing
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:00.600]   homosexuality would have been received with the same kind of disgust.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.160]   Again, even for me to say that, I have to say it carefully, because it's been sold
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.760]   so effectively that this should be accepted.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.560]   Homosexuality is not like every other sin.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:20.880]   It is highlighted in scripture as an abomination.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:29.120]   Homosexual sin is emphasized, especially egregious sin, both here and in Romans 124.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:41.200]   Again, I know you and I live in a culture where bakeries are being shut down, TV, newscasters,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:49.080]   actors are losing their jobs simply by saying homophobic slurs.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:55.040]   In the previous administration, there were talks about shutting down churches that refused
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.040]   to accept it.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.080]   If you say we're not going to perform gay marriages, that you can lose your license
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.500]   and your non-profit status.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.000]   You can practice this in your home.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.900]   Up in Canada, if you try to teach your kids, even in your home, that homosexuality is wrong,
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:17.000]   but the government is trying to go after homeschooled kids so that they can't teach their kids.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.800]   They have been so successful in brainwashing the world that you can't even mention it.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.880]   It's been equaled with civil rights.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.080]   That's why it's a challenge today.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.380]   Where do we get our morality?
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.360]   Does it come from you?
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:44.120]   Whether it disgusts you or not, whether you think it's wrong or right, or does God determine
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.120]   that?
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.840]   Is it my statutes?
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.680]   Is it my laws that we obey?
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.540]   Are we renewed in the renewing of our mind based upon his word?
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.200]   Or our sense of righteousness comes from whatever generation that you've been born in.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.260]   I was born maybe in a previous generation, so that's why I have those morals.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.960]   You were born in this generation, so therefore you have those morals.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.300]   And then when you have kids, what will be accepted in that generation, who knows?
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:19.360]   Considering the sexual perversion that's on the internet, and they're younger and younger
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.320]   that are exposed to all of these things.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.640]   So by the time you have kids and you're in your 40s and 50s, what is going to be okay
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.960]   to them?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.400]   Is that how we determine right and wrong?
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.760]   And then what's going to be by the time you have grandkids?
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.800]   Is sexual immorality going to be redetermined by this slippery slope?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.040]   That's why he says over and over again, "It is my statutes.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.500]   It is my judgment."
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.140]   What does the scripture say?
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.680]   Even bestiality.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:57.280]   I've never heard of anybody arguing for bestiality because they have not pushed this.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.280]   But why not?
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.560]   And again, you've probably heard this argument before.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   It's like, "Well, what if they were born this way?"
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.800]   There are people born with extra testosterone, which makes them extra aggressive, and they
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   get angry more easily.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.680]   But we would never say being angry with people is acceptable because I'm born with extra
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.680]   testosterone.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   There are certain things that we determine to be right or wrong, no matter how you were
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.680]   born.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.720]   In fact, the scripture says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.960]   Every inclination that we had in our sin was perverted.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.280]   Even our heterosexual sexuality is perverted.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.400]   It's not just homosexuality.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.600]   It's not just homosexuality.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.800]   It's just that homosexuality is highlighted, and it is being pushed.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.720]   And that's why there's an argument, that's why there's a debate going on.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.600]   That study in itself is questionable, but even if that study was true, just being born
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.840]   with inclination doesn't make it right or wrong.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.160]   Morality is not determined by our society.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.360]   It's not determined by what you think, what we think, or majority thinks.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.740]   It's determined by what God says.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.760]   You may have talked to somebody who tried to wiggle scripture and pervert it to say
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.320]   what it doesn't say, that that's not what it says.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.920]   That's not how this word should be translated.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:24.400]   That is not—no person who knows any Greek will argue for that.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.720]   Unless it is done for a specific agenda.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.920]   That's not what the scripture says.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.440]   It is plainly written in scripture.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.000]   Even bestiality, there's records of it.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.280]   Idol worship and Yugra involve bestiality as part of their worship ceremony.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:46.960]   All of these things are very practical prohibitions because it is embedded into history, even
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.600]   today.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:56.680]   The Romans 1, 24-28, "Therefore God gave them over in their lust of their hearts to
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.360]   impurity so that their bodies would be dishonored among them."
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.080]   So stop right there.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.880]   God's ultimate judgment is you continue to go down that path.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.360]   He said God gives them over.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.180]   How does he give them over?
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.600]   He just lets you do it.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.320]   If you're going to keep watching pornography, if you're going to keep practicing sexual
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:19.040]   immorality, okay, I'm not going to stop you.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:25.280]   It's like your kid fights, fights, fights, then at some point, I said don't touch it,
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   don't touch it.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.360]   I was having this conversation with a brother today and he was saying like, yeah, you tell
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.880]   your child, don't touch that, don't touch that, don't touch that.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   They just determine.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.480]   I said, then, okay, then touch it.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.040]   Then they touch it like, and they start screaming their head off.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   I told you.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:46.280]   That's basically what God is saying.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:50.360]   I'm telling you not to do that because of the damage it's going to do to you, to the
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.840]   church, to your wife, to your children, to your husband, to your kids.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.720]   But if you're going to keep touching that, keep touching, see what happens.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.200]   And you're going to experience the pain that I was trying to prevent you from.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.760]   And so he says, "So that their bodies would be dishonored among them, for they exchanged
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.100]   the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.480]   who is blessed forever.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   Amen."
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.600]   "For this reason, God gave them over to degrading passions.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.360]   For their woman exchanged the natural functions for that which is unnatural."
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:25.260]   So you notice how he said the first, when God just gave them over, right?
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.920]   So sexual perversion.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.000]   And he said when he gave them over, saying express it any way you want, he says homosexuality,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.520]   right?
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:40.440]   Now, I'm not saying that all homosexuality is a result of just rampant perversion, right?
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:47.280]   I've met, I met homosexuals who just in tears didn't want to be, but they had these desires,
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.280]   right?
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:54.120]   But I've also met plenty of people who came into homosexuality through perversion when
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.400]   they were young.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:02.880]   I had a good close friend of mine who told me that his child, who's a college sophomore
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:08.980]   junior now, he came confessed, not to argue with his parents because his dad's a pastor.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.960]   He said that he was having homosexual attractions.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.840]   And so his dad sat him down and says, "Tell me what happened because I want to understand."
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.360]   And he basically told him the story how he was in sixth grade, went over to his friend's
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:26.080]   house and his friend had access to pornography and they just started watching pornography.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.960]   Every time he went over to their house, he was watching pornography.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.160]   And then by the time he was seventh, eighth, ninth grade, it started getting worse.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.440]   So just like perversion, like whatever it was you started with isn't enough.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.100]   So you would get more and more with different kind of fetishes.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:46.560]   And he said that as he was flipping through the porn site, they had all these gay channels
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.500]   and out of curiosity he went and he started watching.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.940]   So it was a gradual process that led him there.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:59.300]   And all of a sudden he realized he was having these, I mean, his desires were so perverted.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.380]   It was done out of curiosity.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:07.880]   Again, for the sake of time, I'm not going to get into it, but my experience and talking
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:13.120]   to people and what I've observed, there is a connection to this.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.280]   When you allow your lust to be rampant and say, "Well, there's no guidelines.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.440]   We create our own morals."
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.400]   And you say, "God just lets you do whatever you desire."
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.200]   It's not just about homosexuality.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.720]   We don't know where that path is going to go.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.640]   It's just like pouring water into a sloped ground without any kind of channel.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.000]   You have no idea where it's going to go.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   I've talked to pedophiles.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.520]   And you ask them what happened.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.520]   Same story.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.680]   They got into pornography and they just got worse and worse and worse and out of curiosity
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.560]   it just kind of led them down to that path.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:54.000]   So the scripture says they exchanged what God desired, what God intended with a lie
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.880]   and as a result God gave them over.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.200]   When God gave them over, they started to act unnaturally.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.260]   And in the same way also men abandoned their natural function with women and burned in
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.640]   their desire toward one another.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.840]   This is all as a result of God turning them over.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.360]   Just allowing their lust to have its full expression, committing indecent acts and receiving
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.880]   in their own persons the due penalty of their error.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.760]   And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to depraved
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:26.960]   mind to do those things which are not proper.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:34.800]   Verse 25 to 30 in conclusion, the urgency of this, sexual immorality, it defiles oneself.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.960]   And we talked about already in 1 Corinthians 6, 18 to 20, what that one self, your body
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:39.960]   is talking about.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:45.120]   It's not just talking about your body, but everything else that we're connected to.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:52.640]   So it has a defiling effect of anything that we're connected to.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.800]   Sexual immorality, it affects our wives, it affects our friendship, it affects the
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:04.720]   church, it affects our witness, it affects our worship, it affects fellowship, it affects
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.200]   whatever it is that we're connected to.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:13.560]   Sexual immorality, it says over and over again, four or five separate times, it talks about
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.000]   how it defiles the land.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.080]   Let me get to that passage.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:24.200]   In Romans 8, 19 to 22, it says, "For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.000]   for the revealing of the sons of God.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.280]   For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who was
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.520]   subjected in hope.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.280]   That the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into freedom
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.000]   and glory of the children of God.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.680]   For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   until now."
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.560]   Remember when Adam and Eve falls?
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:51.280]   It wasn't just Adam and Eve that became corrupt, that was corrupted.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.960]   Remember what happened?
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.080]   Before the fall, they were being fruitful, multiplying, and it was functioning the way
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.360]   God intended, but after the fall, what did he say?
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.080]   You're going to work, right?
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.000]   You're going to work and labor, and you're going to buy the sweater of your brow.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.120]   Basically, your life is going to be hard, and at the end of all your labor, what is
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.280]   going to produce?
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.080]   Thorns and thistles, right?
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.720]   The scripture clearly says, right?
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:21.400]   Our sin and where we live, the earth, is connected.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:27.480]   That's why at the end, when God restores all things, what happens?
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.360]   How is it described in Revelation chapter 20 and 21?
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:35.060]   New heaven and new earth, right?
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.840]   New heaven and new earth.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.840]   You look at all these people who are looking at the world decreasing.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:43.320]   You know people talk about like, you know, global warming, and there's a bunch of people
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.200]   who are saying global warming is not happening.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:53.840]   Whether global warming is happening or not, the earth is decreasing, right?
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.280]   It is getting uglier.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:01.880]   Whether it's the ozone, whether it's the plastic in the ocean, whether it's overfishing, whether
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:09.280]   it's over farming, whether it's just rampant population increase, whatever it is, or war
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.080]   or pestilence, whatever it is.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.520]   The world that we're living in is not becoming more beautiful.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.400]   It's getting uglier, right?
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.960]   Physically it's getting uglier, right?
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:27.260]   The scripture talks about how the land became corrupted along with our sins and is eagerly
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:32.800]   waiting for the redemption of God's children because when we are redeemed and Christ finally
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.960]   comes, there's going to be a new heaven and new earth that's going to be restored, right?
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.400]   But he says over and over again that sexual immorality actually perverts and corrupts
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   the land itself.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.600]   And then finally, sexual immorality is an abomination to the Lord, right?
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:57.320]   It's as strong of a term that you can get, you can use, that this is how God feels towards
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:07.680]   sexual immorality.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:15.160]   Having said all of that, there isn't a single person in this room, young or old, that doesn't
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:20.520]   wrestle with perverted lust.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:27.000]   And the way that the enemy uses this against us is that because it is a sin that we don't
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   want to talk about.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.880]   You know, when you slander somebody or you said something you shouldn't have said or
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:36.800]   you compromise, you know, we're more eager to share that and say, "Yeah, I shouldn't
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   have done this or I shouldn't have compromised."
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:45.080]   But when it comes to sexual perversion or sexual immorality, there's shame attached
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:51.440]   to that so Satan uses that to cause us to hide, right?
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.800]   And we don't confess it.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.240]   I mean, we want to overcome it but we don't confess it.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.880]   And as a result of that, Satan has a hold on that part of our life where we end up creating
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.520]   two separate worlds.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.100]   We have this world where we present to God and here's a world that we hide.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.440]   And if we're not careful, we can create two worlds.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:14.240]   That's why you hear all these people who are so powerful in the pulpit and after 20, 30
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.660]   years, you find out there's all kinds of sexual perversion was happening behind the scene
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.200]   because they've created two worlds, right?
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.600]   Now having said all of that, the goal of this Bible study is not to simply say, "Shame
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:33.040]   on you," because we're all under that corruption, every single one of us, right?
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:39.440]   One, to recognize sin as sin, that if we've gotten in the habit of excusing perversion
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:45.400]   in our lives, that needs to be seen from God's eyes to recognize what kind of damage it's
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.480]   doing, right?
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.040]   It is not simply a mistake.
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.640]   It says it is an abomination to the Lord.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.240]   So we need to see that from God's perspective, right?
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   One.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:03.440]   Secondly, just like anything else, the goal of revealing sin is not to simply be shamed.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:09.400]   The goal of revealing sin is to bring us to repentance because the only answer to regenerate
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.440]   and restore and redeem is the blood of Christ.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.680]   So recognizing sin as sin is ultimately to bring us to Christ, right?
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:23.840]   But if you refuse to call it what it is in God's eyes, then there's nothing to repent,
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.840]   right?
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.440]   It's just, "Ah, we all do it.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:30.520]   This is something that everybody struggles with to a certain degree," right?
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:34.560]   As long as you keep that kind of attitude, there's no real repentance.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.880]   True repentance requires us coming before God, beating our chest, right?
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.300]   I'm a sinner in need of His grace.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:51.280]   So my encouragement is in our small groups, and if not today, at some point, if you are
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:58.140]   serious about being a worshiper of God and this is a regular part of your life, first
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.940]   find people to confess this sin to, to keep you accountable, to pray, and to run this
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.300]   together with, right?
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:11.140]   So that somebody can regularly ask you, "What's going on with you?"
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.100]   And you don't just continue to sweep sin.
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:16.980]   And any time you sweep sin under the rug, it ends up growing and defiling every other
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:20.020]   part of your life, right?
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.760]   So it says, "Flee from youthful lusts.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.660]   Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.220]   Do it not by yourself, but together," right?
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.380]   Together.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.820]   And again, I can tell you, if you are sitting here thinking like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so,
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.660]   I'm so ashamed," right?
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:42.380]   Look to your left and to your right, the people to your left and to your right are thinking
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:44.460]   the exact same thing.
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:49.980]   There's not a single person in here who has not been corrupted in our lust, right?
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:56.220]   So as long as we keep it a secret, it becomes a stronghold for Satan, right?
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.260]   That's why the scripture says to confess to one another, right?
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:03.380]   It doesn't mean tomorrow it's going to be gone, that lust is still going to be there,
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.340]   but at least you're fighting it together.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.280]   We're fleeing together, okay?
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.740]   So we have five discussion questions.
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.740]   In what way does sexual impurity damage your relationship with God and others?
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:15.180]   Be as specific as you can.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.540]   I want to, I want to ask you guys to do your best to try to go over all five questions
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.140]   if possible, okay?
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.260]   In what way have you seen it?
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:29.180]   In what way does it, right, damage your relationship with God and others?
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:33.340]   When do you feel the most vulnerable to sexual impurity?
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:37.440]   At night, when you're by yourself, when you're watching movies, right?
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.660]   If you're dating, right, when you're in a car by yourself, when you're watching movies
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:49.500]   at home on a couch, like when is sexual impurity the greatest, right?
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.540]   Has sexual impurity become an acceptable part of your life?
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:57.060]   Do you catch yourself saying like, well, you know, we always stream, when somebody asks
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:02.380]   you how you're doing, it's like, well, you know, I'm struggling, or not good, or, but
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:04.720]   you're never really confessing, right?
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.700]   Has it become an acceptable part of your spiritual life, right?
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:14.980]   What practical measures have you taken to combat sexual impurity in your life?
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:18.620]   What have you done in the past that helped you to remain pure, have some success combating
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.380]   sexual temptations, right?
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:26.020]   So if you say, you know what, you know, I got covenant life, or I read a book together,
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:31.700]   I met with a brother, and he called me every week, what did you do in the past that you
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.900]   feel was successful?
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:37.100]   Maybe share that in your group, maybe that's something that you can practice again with
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.960]   some other people.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.540]   Take some time to pray and make commitment to keep each other accountable in this area
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:47.500]   by being willing to be asked and ask accountability questions each week, right?
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:56.040]   Again, I can't exaggerate this enough, right, how important this is.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.820]   And when I say that if you ask me what is one of the biggest problems in the church,
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:06.860]   I mean, I could tell you a couple, you know, like constant distraction with entertainment,
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:11.580]   right, constantly just drifting toward lukewarmness, I mean, that's a constant problem, especially
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:17.020]   in Orange County, and I would put this as either number one or two, right?
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:25.100]   And until we take this in seriously, no matter how much we plan and desire and work, like
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:28.460]   this sin is always going to be holding us back, right?
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:34.100]   So I'm going to ask you to take some time to pray and do your best to discuss all five
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:38.260]   of these questions, and especially in the application part, right?
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:42.020]   If you absolutely feel uncomfortable, I don't think I can share this with this particular
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.420]   group, let me know.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.900]   I'll try to help you find a group, right?
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.300]   I'll try to help you find a group that you can be together.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.940]   I hope that that's not the case.
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.580]   I hope that whatever group that you're in, that you can be vulnerable with each other
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:58.220]   enough to be able to be honest, right, and wrestle with this together.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:02.700]   Okay, like I said, we're all in the same boat, right?
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:06.020]   This is not a mature Christian and immature Christian problem.
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:10.800]   This is a problem period with anyone who's in the flesh, right, until we get home.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:14.620]   So hopefully we can acknowledge that and fight and flee together, okay?
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:23.340]   So let me pray for us and then take some time to discuss with your group.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:28.100]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this particular chapter.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:37.700]   Lord, we live in a generation, Lord God, where the access to pornography has become so easy,
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:43.380]   just sitting in our pockets at any time in any convenience, all kinds of things, Lord
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:48.780]   God, that we couldn't have possibly imagined in the previous generation.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:54.740]   We need your help, Father God, that our hearts may be changed, that we would see the damage
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:59:03.620]   of this not only to us, but to our families, our wives, our children, our community, our
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.260]   witness.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:10.760]   Lord, this particular sin, Lord, we can't do it ourselves.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.560]   We need you, Father God.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.360]   Help us to be vulnerable.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:22.580]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize our weakness, that together as a church that we may flee,
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:24.460]   encourage, strengthen one another.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:32.040]   So I pray, especially tonight, Lord God, as we discuss that there will be openness, vulnerableness,
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   and asking for your grace, asking for your Holy Spirit to guide, that you will protect
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:44.280]   us, Lord God, from demonic influence, Lord, that desires to hold our feet, who is constantly
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:50.640]   scheming, Lord, to want to protect our reputation more than our true worship.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.680]   I pray, Father, that you would guide and lead us for that purpose tonight.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:03.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
