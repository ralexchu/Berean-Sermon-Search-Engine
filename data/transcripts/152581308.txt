[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   >>Thank you Andrew. And again I actually asked him not to
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.380]   speak too much about the particulars about Japan because
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.820]   he was so eager to present. He had slides and he wanted to do
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.920]   like, "Hey, let's go evangelize Japan." And I said, "Because
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.060]   it's Sunday worship we have to kind of limit it to just your
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.300]   testimony." In the future when we have more time we want to
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.800]   give him an opportunity to share with us because there is a lot
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.300]   more that they desire to share if you ask him. We're hoping and
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.940]   praying possibly in the future because they are going to
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.640]   continue their relationship out in Japan. And so they are going
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.840]   to, at least they are planning to go back there as often as
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.180]   they can to continue the work that they were part of. And so
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.080]   maybe in the future God would open the door that that may
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.320]   happen. One of the things that I was kind of surprised about
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.820]   Japan, and again along with their testimony and other people
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.160]   that have shared with us about sharing the Gospel in Japan is
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.300]   the persecution that happens in Japan. You know you think about
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.800]   persecution, you think about the Middle East, or North Korea,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.940]   or maybe even India. But you know there is a saying in
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.780]   Japan like, "The nail that sticks out is the one that
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.540]   gets hammered." So, if you are different than the people
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.580]   around you, you kind of get persecuted. And the more
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.820]   stories I hear about Japanese Christians and how they get
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.760]   shunned from society, and even from parents, and brothers, and
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.220]   sisters. And so it is a big, big decision for a Japanese
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.560]   person to come to Christ. And so again that was kind of an
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.500]   eye opener to me in seeing why it is so hard to share the
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.940]   Gospel with them. Because it is kind of like they have this
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.000]   national identity, it is kind of hard for them to break out of
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.800]   that individually. But again I was very thankful for their
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.940]   testimony and for the work that they were doing. And again
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.820]   they are going to be gone for about seven months and then
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.340]   they'll be back. And they'll be back here permanently. But the
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.520]   things that they learned, again it is not just for them, but
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.020]   for all of us that we would have that kind of mindset.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.660]   We are missionaries. We are not certain people who said,
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.400]   "I'm going to go overseas," are the only missionaries. Every
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.000]   Christian who has been saved by the blood of Christ, wherever
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.640]   we are to live as missionaries. And so that's why I thought it
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.540]   would be encouraging to kind of hear their testimony. This
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.220]   morning if you can turn your Bibles to Nehemiah chapter 1,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.820]   1-11. And as I mentioned last week I want to kind of give a
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.520]   push and a foundation for the need for prayer in our church
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.120]   for 2016. And I want to look at just this first portion of
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.260]   Nehemiah, Nehemiah chapter 1. And I'm going to read through
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.800]   verse 11 and then we'll jump into the message this morning.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.440]   "The word of Nehemiah, the son of Hakaliah, now it happened in
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.480]   the month of Chislev. In the twentieth year, as I was in
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.080]   Susa the capital, that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.280]   certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.220]   who escaped, who had survived the exile and concerning
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.280]   Jerusalem. And they said to me, 'The remnant there in the
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.160]   province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.420]   shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.640]   destroyed by fire.' As soon as I heard these words I sat down
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.400]   and wept and mourned for days. And I continued fasting and
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.580]   praying before the God of Heaven. And I said, 'O Lord God
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.280]   of Heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.140]   steadfast love with those who love Him and keep His
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.180]   commandments. Let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.820]   hear the prayers of your servant that I now pray before
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.260]   you day and night for the people of Israel, your servants.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.760]   Confessing the sins of the people of Israel which we have
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.040]   sinned against you, even I and my Father's house have sinned.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.600]   We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.400]   the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.380]   commanded your servant Moses. Remember the word that you
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.280]   commanded your servant Moses saying, 'If you are unfaithful
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.180]   I will scatter you among the peoples. But if you return to
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.520]   me and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.260]   are in the uttermost parts of Heaven, from there I will
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.960]   gather them and bring them to the place that I have chosen
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.620]   to make my name dwell there. They are your servants and your
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.500]   people whom you have redeemed by your great power and by
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.940]   strong hand. O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayers
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.440]   of the servants and to the prayers of your servants who
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.940]   delight to fear your name and give success to your servant
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.080]   today. And grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.680]   was cupbearer to the King." Let's pray. Gracious and loving
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.080]   Father, we praise you and we thank you for your goodness. We
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.360]   pray to you and we worship you Lord God because you are truly
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.700]   worthy. We desire to confess our love to you in our singing,
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.860]   in our giving, and in your word that we may respond
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.980]   reasonably as people who have seen the light, who love Jesus,
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.980]   who love the Gospel, who love the calling. We are eagerly
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.180]   waiting for his return. Help us Lord God that we would not live
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.220]   day to day purposelessly. Help us Lord to run this race to
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.320]   win. Desiring with all our heart Lord to hear, "Well done my
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.620]   good and faithful servant." We pray Father God that your word
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.700]   would go forth and will not return until it has accomplished
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.940]   its purpose. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. You know I'm going
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.500]   to spend about a couple of weeks in this book in Nehemiah,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.740]   just the first 11 verses because Nehemiah is really about
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.740]   revival. If you've ever heard a revival message, if you've ever
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.380]   heard, went to a revival or read a book on revival it's
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.860]   hard to neglect the book of Nehemiah because Nehemiah is a
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.160]   book about revival. It's about how there was a need in Israel,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.500]   Nehemiah sought out God and prayed and God answered. And as
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.960]   a result of that a big revival breaks out in the land, in
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.200]   Jerusalem as a result of it. Obviously we are not going to
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.500]   have time to go through all of it. We've gone through this
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.700]   many years ago, but for this portion of it we are just going
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.080]   to be spending our time in the first chapter, verse 1-11. You
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   know typically I'm not a pessimist person. If somebody
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.760]   told me that there is a 50/50 chance of something I usually
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.460]   think that I'm going to win. You know what I mean if there is
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.900]   50/50 I'm more of a positive outlook. And even if you lose
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.200]   it's not that big of a deal. But when it comes to the things of
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.680]   the Church and spiritual there are some things that there is a
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.520]   constant concern in my heart. And I've had many conversations
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.080]   with people before and sometimes I have to kind of catch myself
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.160]   because I have to tone it down a bit. But there is a constant
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.600]   concern. The concern is the spiritual state of, you know
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.460]   I'm not going to talk about the whole nation, I'm talking about
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.300]   our generation. In particular this area. To be even more
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.440]   particular our Church. And to be more particular than that
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.080]   ourselves individually. What is going to prevent us from
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.120]   sliding down to become a country club? What is going to prevent
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.080]   us from doing that? Because I've seen greater churches than
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.260]   ours fall apart. Churches that were admired from a distance,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.260]   where a pastor is well known. And we think well that's a
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.200]   church, that's a really biblically sound, God loving,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.860]   Gospel preaching church fall apart. What is going to prevent
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.000]   us from sliding down and become a country club? Just kind of
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.940]   like we are gathered together but true worship is not taking
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.040]   place. We are more concerned about the friendships that are
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.220]   around us, about certain programs, the facilities, than
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.780]   we are about genuinely loving Christ and spreading that love.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.320]   People's soul come into Christ. What will keep us from having a
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.220]   heart that is deceived? To live our lives just going through
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.060]   the motion. And when the scripture warns about having a
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.100]   form of godliness and yet having no power. And the scripture
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.900]   says, "I'm not sharing the Gospel for it is the power of
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.380]   God unto salvation." Not just a security blanket, not just a
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.980]   doctrinal statement, but it is the power of God unto
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.480]   salvation. And He said, "We are warned that at the end times
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.120]   that there is going to be a form of godliness and very little
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.400]   power, no reality. Just go to church." Kind of like sometimes
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.560]   we go to church out of superstition. That if you don't
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.140]   go to church God is not going to bless your family. That maybe
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.900]   you guys are trying to have kids and maybe if I'm not
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.000]   faithful God is not going to bless me with a child. Or maybe
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.740]   you're trying to get into a certain school, or a certain
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.640]   job. And maybe because I didn't tithe, maybe because I wasn't
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.020]   serving the church. And sometimes our worship is
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.880]   nothing more than superstition. Kind of like the reason why
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.260]   people worship Buddha or any other religion. What's going to
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.360]   prevent us from sliding into that and being ok with it? I
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.700]   mean in some sense you feel defeated. You know? After, in
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.540]   fact there was a period in my life where I was actually
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.000]   considering just walking away from ministry because I
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.180]   thought there's nothing I can do. I mean I don't think
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.140]   anything I do is going to matter. All the time that I
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.720]   spend in you know studying the Word of God, discipleship,
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.880]   everything I do in the end, the end result almost seems like
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.820]   it just we keep slipping. But what is going to prevent us
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.000]   from slipping into that? You know as our church grows it
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.600]   gets harder. People kind of get lost in the crowd. And of
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.260]   course friendship is important. Who's going to say friendship
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.640]   isn't important? But where friendship is more important
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:08.500]   than your love for Jesus, then we've slipped. Where we're more
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.180]   concerned about facility, about gatherings, about whatever it
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.520]   is that we get so caught up in. And not be consumed with the
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:24.220]   thought of, "Am I meeting Christ?" The only answer that I
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.900]   have to any of that, the only answer that really is provided
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.840]   in Scripture is prayer. That we become desperate enough that we
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:39.100]   come before God and cling to Him. See, Nehemiah is faced
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.140]   with a serious problem. You know he's living a pretty
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.640]   comfortable life. Nehemiah is a cup bearer. Now you have to
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.340]   understand a cup bearer, you know in our minds a cup bearer
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.380]   is a guy who drinks whatever he's going to drink and see if
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.420]   he dies. If he doesn't die the king gets to drink it. So, it
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.260]   sounds like a lowly job, right? A cup bearer had to be the most
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.100]   trusted person in the kingdom. Because the king basically says,
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.540]   "Well he drank it, I trust him, so I trust that he's not going
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.840]   to kill me." So, imagine if you were a cup bearer at that time
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.540]   you were basically the most trusted person in that kingdom.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.380]   The Scripture says Nehemiah was a cup bearer for the biggest
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:26.920]   superpower nation of that time, the king of Persia. Now all of
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.000]   this, Nehemiah and this revival breaks out because he's asking
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:37.700]   a question about a land of his ancestors about 800 miles away
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.340]   from where he is. And he asks, "What's going on over there?"
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.200]   Because he's curious and the report comes back in verse 3,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.240]   "They said to me, 'Those who survived the exile and are back
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.280]   in the province are in general in great trouble and disgrace.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.080]   The wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.920]   burned with fire.'" Now that was the report that he got. And as
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.560]   a result of that it says in verse 4, "When I heard these
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.100]   things I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned, and
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.040]   fasted, and prayed before the God of Heaven." Again I want
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.700]   you to understand the historical context of Nehemiah's
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.200]   crying out before God. Nehemiah's needs are all met.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.080]   As far as his family is concerned they are multi-
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.320]   millionaires. I mean this guy is a cup bearer. Not only him,
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.620]   his wife, his children, his grandchildren, great-grand
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.820]   children, and many generations to come he's going to have
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.660]   more than enough money to live peacefully. And yet he hears
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.200]   about this land 800 miles away. It's probably about two
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.100]   generations removed already probably. And because he hears
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.200]   this terrible report, and I want you to understand what
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.440]   this report is. It didn't say that these people are getting
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.320]   slaughtered. It didn't say that there is infighting and
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   all kinds of debauchery. All they said was they are in
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.960]   trouble, their gates are broken, and they are burned
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:12.400]   down. And that led him to weep before God. In Nehemiah
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.940]   1.6 it says, "Let your ear be attentive God, and your eyes
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.540]   open to hear the prayers your servant is praying before you
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.880]   day and night for your servants, the people of Israel."
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:30.720]   Why did that report of a broken gate, and a wall that
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.520]   burned down, or the gate that burned down, why did that
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.000]   cause this kind of weeping before God? Especially since
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.440]   he was so well off. You have to understand that the nation
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.200]   of Israel was not an average nation. It was not one of
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.540]   many nations. It was the nation at this time. God chose
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.780]   His people. He made a covenant with them. Again we may ask
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.020]   the question, you know, Jacob and Esau. They say Esau was
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.580]   actually evil because he gave up his birthright so that he
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.560]   could have a bowl of soup. I mean think about it if you
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.560]   were in that position, I mean you are starving to death.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.160]   You went out hunting and your younger brother is
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.200]   conniving, "Give me your birthright." What is a
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.360]   birthright to me? I'm about to starve. I can see myself
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.000]   saying that. I mean I'm hungry. But what was unique
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.140]   about that particular relationship, and that
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.540]   particular family was because God made a covenant with His
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.340]   forefathers that I'm going to bless you, and that you are
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.480]   going to be a blessing to many nations. And that
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   inheritance wasn't just about money and land. It's about
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.160]   the covenant that God made with His forefathers that God
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.420]   is going to bless them. And this is the line in which God
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.020]   is going to bless them. See, Nehemiah wasn't simply
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.700]   worried about a broken fence. He was worried about the
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.240]   spiritual condition that Israel was in. I want to look
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.700]   at two things in Nehemiah's prayer this morning, and then
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.700]   we'll do the others next week. Two things that causes
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:09.280]   revival prayer. One, Nehemiah's prayer was stirred
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.420]   up because he recognized something was not right.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.660]   Nehemiah's prayer stirred up because he recognized
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.460]   something was not right. You know I could sit here, or
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.100]   stand here this morning, like last week, and tell you why
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.900]   we need to pray. And I can expose it, and I can tell you
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.700]   the need for it, and what the Scripture says. But until
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.600]   you recognize that something is wrong, it just becomes
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.340]   something you need to do to appease God. God died for us,
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.840]   so therefore we should be a man of prayer, so we should
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.840]   pray more because that's what good Christians do.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.220]   Right? We need to do that because that's what the
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.720]   Scripture says. But until I can convince you that there
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.460]   is something wrong, that there is a sense of urgency to
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:58.560]   come and plead before God, your prayers will be nothing
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.760]   more than a check off list, something that you need to
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:07.340]   do. See, Nehemiah's prayer of revival was in response to
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.140]   what he saw. See those broken fences, the fire
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.020]   represented their spiritual condition before God. They
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.480]   forgot, and it represented that though God desired with
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.220]   all their heart to bless them, because of their neglect,
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.720]   because of their spiritual condition, they were in the
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:31.800]   condition that they were in. Do we recognize where we are?
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.740]   Those of you who have been Christians for a while, 20
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.640]   years, 30 years, maybe longer, I haven't met a single
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.740]   person that I've talked to who has been a Christian for
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.780]   more than 20, 30 years who says to me that the spiritual
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.740]   condition today is much better than it was when they
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:53.080]   were younger. I've never met a single person. And I can
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.320]   probably say those of you who have been walking for 10
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.500]   years that the condition that it is in now is better than
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.160]   even 10 years ago. I don't think I'm being pessimistic.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.300]   I don't think I'm just being negative. I think that's the
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.780]   reality. We have fallen and we are continuing to fall at a
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:18.480]   much faster pace than before. What is spiritually normal
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.060]   in our generation would have shocked people 30 years ago.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.220]   30 years ago certain things that Christians do, certain
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.260]   things that are being said even up in the pulpit would
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.400]   have been shocking to an average church 30 years ago.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:38.060]   We've become so accustomed to compromise and sin that it
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.700]   is no longer shocking to put it up on Facebook for
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.040]   everyone to see. And our greatest fear is not
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.480]   offending God. Our greatest fear is that we may be called
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.280]   a legalist, judgmental. We have become complacent. The
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.760]   fire for God is not the same. So few people in our
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.800]   generation evangelize. Yes, we talk about missionaries.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.240]   We talk about people who have gone overseas. And I know
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.680]   many of you while you were in college sacrificed and went
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   overseas and went to different places and did difficult
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.480]   things. But that was many years ago. It might have been
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.220]   a year, two years, maybe more than a decade since the last
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.620]   time you deliberately tried to share the Gospel with
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.280]   somebody. And yet every week we open up the Bible, we say
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.220]   that judgment is coming, that the Gospel is the only hope
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.980]   of mankind. It just becomes something that we say. It is
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:41.460]   a theology that we adhere to, but it is no longer the
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.420]   power that transforms us. The lack of concern for
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:51.360]   holiness in our lives. We are concerned about getting the
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.000]   Gospel right. They are using the right terms, praying the
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.800]   right way, using the right words, right phrases, having
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.240]   the church organized in a certain way, and being
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.280]   relevant. Yet we see the decline of holiness in our
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.880]   generation and there is no sense of urgency. God loves
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.760]   us. It is because He is gracious. It is because we
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.600]   could not, He did. And we have these general, broad,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.500]   cliche things that we say to excuse sin. It is not a
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.240]   source of power to pursue righteousness, it is to
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.420]   excuse sin. Let's not get carried away. Let's not be
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.180]   too harsh. Because Jesus loved us despite our sins.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.420]   All of these things are true. But in our generation the
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.260]   brokenness over us. When was the last time you genuinely
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:55.300]   repented for sin? Genuinely repented. Not, "Oh, I
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.300]   shouldn't have done that. I felt so bad. I shouldn't do
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.640]   it next time." Like I'm not talking about just kind of a
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.380]   brushing off. I'm talking about grieving before God.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.040]   Because He sent His only begotten Son to deliver us
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.780]   from an empty way of life. And He made us holy and says,
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.220]   "Now live up to that holiness. Be holy for your
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.260]   Heavenly Father is holy." When was the last time you
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:26.600]   were so convicted that you actually repented in tears?
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:32.300]   See Nehemiah comes before God and he sees the spiritual
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:38.700]   condition of his people. His cupbearer, you know. Every
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:43.880]   need that he has is met. And yet he grieves before God.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.620]   And he pleads and he weeps. And it is this prayer that
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:53.520]   God answers that leads to revival in the land. You know
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.460]   in many countries there is a thing called the Samaritan,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.560]   Good Samaritan Law. And the Good Samaritan Law basically
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.900]   is it's illegal to pass by someone who is in dire need
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:06.500]   and then just neglect them. It's actually a crime in
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.640]   certain parts of the United States that if somebody gets
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.680]   in an accident they are in dire need and you see that
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.640]   there is something you can do and you just keep going.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.820]   You know the scripture, the word that is translated in
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:24.320]   some cases for unbelief and disobedience is apotheos.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.160]   What does that word sound like? English word apotheos.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.700]   In your Bibles it is translated as unbelief or
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:37.640]   disobedience. Apotheos, the root word is pathos and the
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.440]   word pathos means to be persuaded. So when you put an
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.580]   "ah" before it, it's a negation of persuasion. Meaning
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:49.960]   that you refuse to be persuaded. Not necessarily in
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.060]   your thoughts but your life. You can come to church all
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.820]   your life and have different thoughts circling around
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.900]   your head but your life is not persuaded. The way you
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.740]   spend your finances is not persuaded. The way you, what
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.900]   you pursue, what makes you happy, what makes you sad,
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.780]   you are never persuaded. And we call again the scripture,
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.640]   the word for that is apotheos. I remember years ago
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.940]   there was a sister who was confessing her sins after
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.180]   being convicted over certain sins in her life. And I
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.060]   thought it was one of the most honest confessions that
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.820]   I've heard. Her confession basically was, she said, "I
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.220]   am ignorant of the suffering of the world because I have
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.660]   chosen to be ignorant." And I thought that was really
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.560]   insightful because she didn't just own up and say, "You
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.100]   know what? I didn't know." You know? She didn't say
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.640]   that. She said, "I didn't know because I chose not to
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.600]   know. I deliberately gave myself to things that I
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.940]   wouldn't be disturbed." So the reason why I was
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.580]   apathetic because I didn't give any time to look into
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.480]   that. When I heard of it, I said, "Oh, that's good." You
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.160]   know? And that's where she left it because if you
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.520]   pursue it any further it's going to disturb your life.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.060]   So, I remember her confessing, "I didn't know
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.560]   because I chose not to know." Amos chapter 6 verse 1 it
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.700]   says, "Woe to you who are complacent in Zion and to you
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.400]   who feel secure in Mount Samaria, you notable men of
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.240]   the foremost nations to whom the people of Israel come."
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.580]   Verse 4, "You lie on beds inlaid with ivory and lounge
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.820]   on couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.980]   calves." You know when I read this for the first time I
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.520]   was like, "Wow, this sounds exactly like today." You
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.120]   know? This happened thousands of years ago. And God was
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.460]   concerned about these things of the nation of Israel.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.740]   This sounds like today. "You strum away on your harps
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.300]   like David and improvise on musical instruments. You
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.340]   drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.880]   But you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.820]   Therefore, you will be among the first to go into exile.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:06.260]   Your fasting and lounging will end." What a cut to the
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.960]   heart to the nation of Israel. You know they are
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.060]   going to temples making sacrifices and doing all
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.300]   these religious duties and God looks through all of
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.540]   that and said, "That has nothing to do with me." See
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.740]   revival broke out in Nehemiah's prayer because he
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:26.580]   recognized that something went wrong. So when we look
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.740]   at something and say, "Oh, of course, you know, where do
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.620]   you draw the line?" And as our brother Andrew shared
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.420]   with us we kind of compare. And as long as we are not
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.720]   like them, as long as we are not as bad as them. I
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.520]   didn't get drunk last night like those people. I can
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.920]   recite the Gospel. I read the Bible a little bit. And so
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.760]   we are always comparing our righteousness with the
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.100]   people around us. And as long as we are better than a few
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:55.540]   people that we know around us, we are ok. Nehemiah saw
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:00.040]   that something terribly went wrong. Spiritually the
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.980]   nation of Israel went complacent. The Temple of God
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.760]   was not what it ought to be. The gate that was supposed
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.860]   to protect His people and the Temple was neglected. It
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.820]   wasn't because of the attack. It wasn't because they ran
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.500]   out of money. It was simply because of neglect. It just
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.100]   wasn't important. They were busy taking care of their
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.940]   own lives, paying their own bills. And they saw what was
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.500]   happening at the Temple and they were just neglect. And
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.080]   so what Nehemiah comes before God is crying out before
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.280]   God was not deliverance from enemies. Was not more food
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.220]   because they didn't have enough food. It was a
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.460]   spiritual apathy of the nation of Israel. And that's
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.020]   what caused this man to weep. And that's what caused this
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:56.460]   man to cry out to God. Some of you guys make fun of me
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.460]   every time I say my favorite musician is Keith Green. He
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:05.640]   no longer lives physically but he lives spiritually. And
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.180]   I've never bought a Christian tape ever in my life. Keith
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.440]   Green is the only one I've ever purchased. And because
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.620]   God used his lyrics and his music to really convict me
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.520]   and revive me when I was kind of going astray. One of the
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.980]   songs that even to this day I listen to, I get convicted,
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.760]   it's almost like reading Scripture. Keith Green has a
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.160]   song called, "A Sleep in the Light." And let me read you
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.860]   his lyrics. It says, "Do you see, do you see all the
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.460]   people sinking down? Don't you care, don't you care? Are
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.080]   you going to let them drown? How can you be so numb not to
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.740]   care if they come? You close your eyes and pretend the job
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:49.180]   is done. Bless me Lord, bless me Lord. You know it's all I
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:54.080]   ever hear. No one aches, no one hurts, no one even sheds
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.460]   one tear. But he cries, he weeps, he bleeds and he cares
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.160]   for your needs. And you just lay back and keep soaking it
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:08.500]   in. Oh, can't you see it's such sin? Because he brings
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.200]   people to your door and you turn them away as you smile
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.440]   and say, "God bless you, be at peace." And all Heaven just
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.120]   weeps because Jesus came to your door and you've left him
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.720]   out on the street. Open up, open up, give yourself away.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.780]   You see the need, you hear the cries. So, how can you
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.460]   delay? God's calling and you're the one. But like Jonah
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.260]   you run. He's told you to speak but you keep holding it
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.700]   in. Can't you see it's such sin? The world is sleeping in
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.140]   the dark that the church just can't fight because it's
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.700]   asleep in the light. How can you be so dead when you've
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:51.240]   been so well fed? Jesus rose from the grave and you, you
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.120]   can't even get out of bed. Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:00.480]   come on, get out of your bed. You know I feel like if
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.820]   somebody wrote that today, it's like, "He's a legalist."
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.800]   I think they would just write him off as a legalist. You
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.100]   know, it's about grace. It's about love. Of course it's
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.100]   about grace. Of course it's about His mercy. Of course
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.080]   it's about the Gospel. But it's about the Gospel that
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   changes us. It's about the Gospel that renews us,
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.380]   empowers us to desire more than ever to want
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.220]   righteousness in life. The Gospel opens our eyes to see
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.720]   the lost where we just saw them as people in the past,
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:39.620]   but now we see them who are lost and in dire need of a
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:46.060]   Savior. See we are not like the world. Winning the
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:52.000]   lottery is not enough. If you are a child of God, your
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.640]   bills being paid is not enough. Your child being
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.980]   healthy is not enough. Being able to purchase a nice
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.640]   home is not enough. Having a nice church and a bunch of
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.980]   friends to share your life with is not enough. See in
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.260]   this world, if you are a child of this world, all of
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.860]   that, all of that should be enough for you to be able to
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.220]   wake up and say, "Thank you." See, but if you are a child
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:20.760]   of God, you could have all of that. And to be away from
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.740]   the center of who He is and feel absolutely bankrupt.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.840]   Because we are. You can have all the money in the world
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.880]   and all the safety and all the health and all the
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.880]   friends in the world, and you don't have a personal
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:45.180]   relationship with God, then we are bankrupt. See until we
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.720]   recognize, until I can convince you that something
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:55.160]   has gone wrong, we won't pray. Because prayer is just
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.300]   a discipline. If prayer is just something that you need
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.300]   to do, it seems like a waste of time because you read
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.600]   the Scripture, you learn something. You come to
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.440]   fellowship, you build friendship, you give money,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.580]   we can use that to do all these things. But prayer,
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.380]   unless there is a need that we are desperate to bring to
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.820]   God, we will never see the need to pray. See, Nehemiah's
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.960]   prayer in his revival always breaks out because you see
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.760]   the spiritual condition and we bring this to God. Are you
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:37.100]   convinced? When you look at the spiritual condition of
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:42.480]   where we are, does that concern you that if we've
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.120]   slipped this far in such a short period of time, what
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.080]   the spiritual condition will look like when your
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:56.760]   children are your age? That scares me. If in the last
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.400]   20 years, 30 years, if we've slipped this far, what will
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.860]   it look like when my children are in their 40's? Would we
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.600]   be able to go back, go I guess to the future, 30 years
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.940]   from now and recognize the church that may be? Just
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:19.040]   hoping, hoping that it won't be like this sliding won't
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:26.360]   keep going. If it continues to go the way it goes, I'm
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.660]   just again, just using logical deduction, we're going
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.760]   to be exactly where Europe is in their faith in the
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.160]   United States. That's exactly where it is. Some of you
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.040]   guys, I'm not going to go into too much detail, you
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.800]   guys know what it's like. Anybody who has visited
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.040]   Europe you know exactly what it's like. It's almost
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.480]   impossible to find a church that believes in the Gospel.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.880]   There are churches everywhere, ancient churches
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.380]   everywhere. It's almost impossible to go and sit in a
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.780]   church that preaches the Gospel over there. Do we see
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.920]   the need? When does this start? We're just hoping and
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.720]   throwing it down next generation, hoping that
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.520]   revival will come in that generation. Or do we see the
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.560]   need today? Do we see the slipping today? Do we see
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.560]   our hearts hardened today? Do we see the lost today?
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.200]   And does that cause us to come before God and weep as
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:25.280]   Nehemiah wept to pray for revival? See Nehemiah if he
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.020]   only saw the need, he would have wept and that would
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.260]   have been it, despair. You know sometimes we get caught
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.860]   up pointing out what the problem is and then that's
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.520]   where it ends. We have issues and we see problems
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.020]   with pastors and churches and gatherings and say,
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.500]   "Ah, what's wrong with them? What's wrong with them?"
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   If that's where we stop all we do is to further the
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.020]   problem. See, but that's not for Nehemiah. Nehemiah came
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.460]   and the second thing about his prayer is he goes right
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.700]   in and he recognizes there is a solution. And that
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.860]   solution is recognizing the God that he worships in
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.900]   Nehemiah 1, 5-6, "O Lord God of Heaven, the great and
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.200]   awesome God, and keeps covenant and steadfast love
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.080]   with those who love Him and keep His commands. Let your
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.720]   ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayers
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.880]   of your servant. And I now pray before you day and
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.780]   night for the people of Israel, your servants." See
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.720]   it could have easily just led to despair. It's like,
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.160]   "Yeah, that's just the way it is." And we become expert
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.260]   of critiquing what's gone wrong. But Nehemiah comes
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:34.100]   before God and he prays, "O Lord." The answer is in Him.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.900]   He calls Him by His proper name Yahweh, even though it
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.380]   is not written in your Bible. The word Lord in Hebrew is
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.880]   Yahweh. If you guys remember the word Yahweh, the name
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.580]   Yahweh is the formal name that God gives to Moses as He
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.960]   drew near to His people. "Tell them, if they ask me
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:56.260]   who sent me, tell them Yahweh has sent you." Exodus 3:14,
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.620]   "The God of Moses, I am who I am. This is what you are to
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.200]   say to the nation of Israel, 'I am has sent me to you.'"
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.100]   God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The Lord
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.400]   Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.180]   God of Isaac, God of Jacob has sent me to you. This is my
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.980]   name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:22.780]   from generation to generation. I am who I am." You know
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.620]   that name, the name that He introduced Himself as I am.
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.060]   You know the first few years as a Christian I never
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:34.500]   understood I am. It's like Bob, John, you know like
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:39.460]   there's a title, I am. Like who are you? I am. Right, and
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.440]   you are. That's a strange conversation, right? I never
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.480]   understood that. What does that mean I am? The more I
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:53.580]   meditate, the more I wrestle with who He is in my life, I
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.980]   can't think of a better name than I am. Because I am
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.560]   basically means everything originates from Him.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.320]   Everything starts with Him. Your life starts with Him.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.560]   Your joy starts with Him. Your hope is in Him.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:13.100]   Everything is I am. It's not I will be. It's not I was. It's
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.300]   I am. And that's exactly what it means in Deuteronomy 6:4
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.280]   He says, "Tell this, repeat this, and tell this to
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.740]   generations to come." The great Shema, "Hear O Israel,
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.680]   the Lord our God, the Lord is one." He's not saying
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.920]   quantitatively like there's all these but out of them
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.260]   there's only one God. That's true. But along with that
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.060]   when He says the Lord is one He's saying there is no one
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.640]   like Him. There is no other. Just like when we talk about
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.200]   holiness there's an aspect of holiness where we say He is
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.540]   perfect morally. But the word holy basically means to be
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.700]   set apart. He's unique. There's nothing and no one
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:56.780]   like Him. So when Nehemiah is grieved over the spiritual
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.920]   condition of Israel he immediately turns to the I am.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:07.520]   Yahweh. Because you're the answer. Not more people, not
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.320]   more funding, not more organization, not more effort.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.500]   You. If we recognize the problem in our generation and
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.700]   even in our life, the first and foremost, before we turn
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:25.300]   to a counselor, before we turn to friends, do we turn to the
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.000]   great I am? You know as a pastor I can't tell you like
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:35.380]   you know preaching is easier. Because I'm dissecting the
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.420]   Word and I'm just telling you. It's just one way. I don't
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.120]   have to answer your questions. I just tell you. And then
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.920]   when I'm done I just walk off. Counseling is hard. Some
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.860]   people are better than others because counseling they're
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.800]   coming asking questions and they're looking for answers.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.440]   Sometimes it's very easy. Just knock it off. And that's
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.900]   the question. It's very easy to answer sometimes. And then
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.100]   sometimes they come, you know you guys come and you have
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.640]   these heartbreaking things and I want to give you the
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.840]   answer but I don't have the answer. And I say, "Oh man,
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.880]   where's the Bible? I've got to go get counseling and do all
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.580]   this stuff." And I realize I don't have the answer. And it
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:21.480]   took years of frustration until I realized God didn't give me
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.260]   the answer. I don't have to have the answer. My job is to
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.600]   tell you to go to the one who does have the answer. Right?
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:37.360]   He's the answer. And isn't that all the I am statements in
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.740]   the book of John? I am the bread of life. I am the vine.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:46.200]   I am the light. I am the good shepherd. I am the door. I am
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.180]   the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.220]   Father but through me. All the I am statements is to get as
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.120]   disciples and everybody to recognize it is not the temple.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.980]   It is not more of this. It is not the nation of Israel
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:03.660]   becoming a superpower. He said, "I am." He was trying to get
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.560]   people to come to me and recognize Him as the answer.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.760]   Not the counselors, not the organization, not the money,
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:15.040]   not our circumstance, but Him. So when Nehemiah faced trouble
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.900]   he didn't just fall into despair. He came before God
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.540]   pleading with the great I am. Hebrews 11, 6 it says, "Without
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.180]   faith it is impossible to please Him for he who comes to
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:33.220]   God must believe that He is." I am. That He is and He is a
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:40.120]   rewarder of those who seek Him. He's the rewarder, not me. Not
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.500]   your counselor, not your wife, not your husband. Maybe some of
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.640]   your frustration at home is because you're looking for
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.540]   answers in your husband and your wife. Maybe the frustration
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:54.580]   sometimes may be at church and you put your hope in the wrong
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.820]   place. He is. He is God who keeps the covenant and
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.220]   steadfast love. The reason why we are not consumed in
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.720]   Lamentations 3, 22 it says, "Because of the Lord's great
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:14.500]   love we are not consumed for His compassion never fails." If
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.060]   Bill Gates came to you and said, "You know what I've
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.300]   cleared my schedule. I've heard of your name. I heard your
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.540]   need. I hear you're in great trouble. I cleared my schedule
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.800]   for a month and I want you to give some good thought about
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:31.220]   what I can do for you." Knowing who he is, you know,
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.840]   either the richest man on earth or the second richest man on
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.960]   earth, right? And he comes and says, "Ask." Right? "But I
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.320]   want you to ask." I think we are going to take some time to
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.460]   think about that. We are going to say, "I'm hungry." This is
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.700]   Bill Gates. You can ask that of anybody. You can ask that of
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.900]   your friends, your parents. I mean you can ask that. You can
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.740]   think, considering what he has. And I think what I would be
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:59.780]   thinking was, "A million? Is that too much?" It's not too
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.620]   much to him, but it's too much for me. So, maybe, you know,
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.860]   I don't want to look greedy. Two million? You know, how far?
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.620]   How far can I stretch this without him being shocked? If I
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.760]   say a million, he's like, "That's it?" I don't want that
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.820]   either. So, you're going to get through it. Like, "Well, what
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.300]   can I get away with? How much?" Because you know what he's
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:24.400]   worth. And he said he's willing to do whatever. Right? If you
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.040]   consider the content of our prayer, how much of it is
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.240]   frivolous? Because we don't recognize who we're praying to.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:39.860]   Right? If you're about in me, my word's about in you, ask
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:46.420]   whatever you wish. It shall be done for you. Right? The God
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.520]   who sent his only begotten son died for us. He who did not
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.760]   spare his own son, how will he not, along with him, freely give
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.900]   us all things? So, ask of me. And I will give you nations
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:04.440]   that maybe sometimes our faith is weak and futile because we
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.280]   don't recognize who it is that we are praying to. That it is
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.180]   not because our prayers are too difficult. That it may be
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:19.720]   because our prayers are too trivial, considering who he is.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:26.240]   Our God could change the direction of history. And we
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.040]   know that Scripture says that our God is a God of covenant.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.900]   And what he promised was, "I will build my church and the
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:39.280]   gates of Hades will not prevail against it." Do we recognize
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.180]   who it is that we're praying to? So, I'm going to just wrap
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:51.420]   it up here for today. We want 2016, again for years to come,
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:56.260]   to address the issue that I think is at the crux of our
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:03.360]   issue. Is before we think about anything else, to establish his
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:08.460]   presence in our lives, in our marriages, with our children,
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.140]   with our church, with our gatherings. That everything
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.940]   that we do, whether it's missions, whether it's Bible
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.540]   study, whether it's family ministry, singles ministry,
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:21.480]   college ministry, that we would saturate it first and foremost
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.580]   by humbling ourselves before the throne of God saying, "Lord
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:30.860]   help us." If you turn your Bibles with me to Psalm 136.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:38.180]   Psalm 136 and I want you guys, we want to have a responsive
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.840]   reading. We never do this at church but I want to do this
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.580]   with you this morning. In Psalm 136 basically the whole
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.120]   chapter goes, "Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, for
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.420]   His steadfast love endures forever." And so it's kind of a
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.100]   refrain going back and forth, back and forth. So, what I
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.400]   want to wrap up this morning doing is I'm going to read the
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.560]   first line, "Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, for His
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.840]   steadfast love endures forever." Basically it's a
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.680]   reminder to the nation of Israel and to us that all is in
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.580]   Him. To come to Him, to praise Him, to worship Him, to plead
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:17.180]   with Him because His steadfast love endures forever. So, as we
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.860]   go through that, there are 26 verses and I want to go through
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.020]   that again as a reminder that that would be embedded in your
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:29.400]   mind and head. And that statement, that doxology would
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:34.300]   go with us as we go to our homes and whatever it is that
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.040]   we are doing that because His steadfast love endures forever
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.500]   that we would pursue Him with all our might. So, I will read
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.580]   one, you read the second, we'll go back and forth. "Give
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.940]   thanks to the Lord for He is good." >>"For His steadfast
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:51.580]   love endures forever." >>Ok, I think it takes about three
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.980]   verses before you get it, right? "Give thanks to the God
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.460]   of Gods." >>"For His steadfast love endures forever." >>"Give
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.360]   thanks to the Lord of Lords." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.660]   endures forever." >>"To Him who alone does great wonders."
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.240]   >>"For His steadfast love endures forever." >>"To Him
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.100]   who by understanding made the heavens." >>"For His
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.940]   steadfast love endures forever." >>"To Him who
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.520]   spread out the earth above the waters." >>"For His
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.620]   steadfast love endures forever." >>"To Him who made
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:26.260]   the great lights." >>"For His steadfast love endures
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.800]   forever." >>"The sun to rule over the day." >>"For His
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.040]   steadfast love endures forever." >>"The moon and
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.680]   stars to rule over the night." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.640]   endures forever." >>"To Him who struck down the first
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.480]   point of Egypt." >>"For His steadfast love endures
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.160]   forever." >>"And brought Israel out from among them."
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.460]   >>"For His steadfast love endures forever." >>"With a
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.820]   strong hand and an outstretched arm." >>"For His
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.700]   steadfast love endures forever." >>"To Him who
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.000]   divided the Red Sea into two." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.660]   endures forever." >>"And made Israel pass through the
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.340]   midst of it." >>"For His steadfast love endures
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.100]   forever." >>"But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.600]   Red Sea." >>"For His steadfast love endures
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.440]   forever." >>"To Him who led His people through the
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.040]   wilderness." >>"For His steadfast love endures
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.220]   forever." >>"To Him who struck down the great
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.720]   kings." >>"For His steadfast love endures
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.280]   forever." >>"And killed mighty kings." >>"For His
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.760]   steadfast love endures forever." >>"Sihon,
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.120]   king of Amorites." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.720]   endures forever." >>"And Ah,
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.100]   king of Bashan." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.360]   endures forever." >>"And gave their land as a
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.400]   heritage." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.740]   endures forever." >>"A heritage to Israel,
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.840]   His servant." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.540]   endures forever." >>"It is He who remembered us in
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.780]   our lowest state." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.040]   endures forever." >>"And rescued us from our
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.980]   foes." >>"For His steadfast love
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.420]   endures forever." >>"He who gives food to all
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.780]   flesh." >>"His steadfast love endures forever."
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.920]   >>"Gives thanks to the God of Heaven." >>"His
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.360]   steadfast love endures forever." >>Would you
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.460]   take a minute to pray with me as I invite the
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:59.060]   praise team to come up. Take some time to
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.160]   consider where we are spiritually,
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.300]   individually, as a church, and as a

[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.420]   Him. Let's take some time to come before the Lord in
