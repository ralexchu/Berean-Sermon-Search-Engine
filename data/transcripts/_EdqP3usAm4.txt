[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   >> All right, good morning.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   First of all, men's and women's flag football
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   flag football fellowship is happening on March 16th,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and then the ladies on March 17th.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   So if you want to participate in that, sign up online, and
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   they'll give you more direction than that.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   That's coming up this Saturday, right?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   It's this Saturday.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Newcomer's lunch.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   If you are new to the church and you want to find out about what's going on at
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   church or you want to meet some of the leaders and
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   just ask some questions about it, this lunch is for you.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   It's happening next Sunday at 1245.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   So after the third service, across the courtyard in that building,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   where the youth group has their service, after the third service at 1245,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   there's going to be a lunch and then a brief presentation and some Q&A time.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   So if you want to come to that, that'll be open for you.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And for Passover meal, as we said, that as Passion Week is coming on Thursday
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   at 630 p.m., Pastor Mark is going to be leading us through what the Passover
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   meal looked like for the disciples.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And so if you haven't participated in that, it's a great opportunity to see
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   exactly what Jesus did when he says, "Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And even if you have done it before and you want to participate,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   especially if you have small children and you want to teach them,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   because much of the Passover meal is to kind of educate the children
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   about the significance and the meaning behind that.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So if you want to participate, please sign up for that.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And then Women's Ministry Conference, that's happening on April 13th.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   So please sign up for that.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And then Berean Service Auction for the members.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Again, you can bid if you're not a member, but it's for members to volunteer
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   for whatever things that you have that you want to donate,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   whether it's goods or services.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And people auction that, and then the finance that comes from that
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   is going to be used for some of our missions to Korea.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   So please sign up for that.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And one last thing that is really important.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   On May 4th, this coming May 4th, on Saturday, we're going to be having
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   a special seminar on abortion, birth control, and IVF.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Right now, as I mentioned before, there's more and more of that discussion
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   that's happening, just chatter that's happening,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   not only in the political arena, but it's happening inside the church.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   As I mentioned before, abortion is not a debatable issue for Christians,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and I want to make that crystal clear.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   But along with that, it has ramifications on birth control and also IVF.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   And so there's a lot of people who are not aware of what's going on.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   To be honest, that was not something that was readily available
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   or talked about in years past.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   But now, because of what's going on around the world,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   there's a lot of chatter, and we need to have clarity on that.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And so we want to make sure that as many of you that can come.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So that Saturday, we're going to actually even have babysitting.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   So we want as many people to come as possible,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   so we're going to provide babysitting, we're going to have snacks,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   and it's going to take us all the way.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   We're going to have two extended sessions.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Pastor James Lee from Cross Life is going to be speaking on this issue.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And so I know we've had an abortion seminar before,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   but this is going to go a little bit more in-depth,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   and then it's going to connect us to birth control and IVF.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And so whether you're married or even if you're college students,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   I think this is a subject that is significant,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   and not only do you need to know, you need to be able to defend it.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And so we want to encourage as many of you to sign up for that as possible.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   So the actual sign-up is going to start next week,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   so when you want to prepare, whatever.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   So we haven't concluded yet whether we're going to have lunch provided,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   but it's going to go up to lunch.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   So if you can make it, please mark that on your calendar so that you can come.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   It's going to be on May 4th.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And so those announcements are going to start coming out this week,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   so just watch out for it.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And again, we will have babysitting,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   so we want to have as many of our church members that can come.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   So it is Saturday, starts at 9, and it will probably take us to about 12, 12:30.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   All right, let me pray for the offering.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And afterwards, our brother Jacob Wong is going to come up
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   and give his testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Father, we thank you for your continued grace and love that you give us.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Lord, we desire to worship you genuinely from spirit and in truth.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Help us, Lord God, to put aside the entanglement, temptation,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   coveting, Lord, of this world,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   that we may desire to see a greater glimpse of the glory of Christ.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Lord, we desire to love him, follow him, and obey him.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Help us this morning, Lord God, with all that we do,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   that it would lead us to that path.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I pray that even the offering that we give,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   that we would not give, Lord, reluctantly,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   that we would give cheerfully as an act of worship,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Let us rise, and before we continue on with our service,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   if we could spend a few moments to greet the neighbors around us.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   [crowd noise]

[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   He became sin.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   He became sin, who knew no sin,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   that we might become His righteousness.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   He humbled Himself and carried the cross.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Love so amazing.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Love so amazing.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Jesus Messiah.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Name above all names.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Blessed Redeemer.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Emmanuel.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Seeking for sinners.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   The ransom from Heaven.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Jesus Messiah.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Lord of all.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   The bread, His blood, the wine.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Broken and poured out all for love.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   The whole earth trembled when it was poured.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Love so amazing.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Love so amazing.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Jesus Messiah.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Name above all names.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Blessed Redeemer.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Emmanuel.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   The rescue for sinners.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   The ransom from Heaven.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Jesus Messiah.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   All our hope.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   All our hope is in You.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   All our hope is in You.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   All the glory to You, God.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   The light of the world.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   All our hope is in You.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   All our hope is in You.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   All the glory to You, God.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   The light of the world.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Jesus Messiah.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Name above all names.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Blessed Redeemer.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Emmanuel.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   The rescue for sinners.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   The ransom from Heaven.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Jesus Messiah.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Lord of all.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Jesus Messiah.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Lord of all.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Good morning, church.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   As long as I can remember, the church has been a part of my life.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   I was born into a Christian home and attended church with my family growing up.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   I professed faith in Christ at a young age and grew up learning teachings from the Bible.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I believed in God and was blessed to have believing parents
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   and supportive mentors to teach me about God's love and my need for Christ.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   However, I can't say that I had a personal relationship
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   with Christ or that faith was a priority during this period of my life.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Growing up, I found my identity in academic achievement
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and being a "good kid" to earn the
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   favor of authority figures.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I idolized relationships and the approval of my peers.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   To me, the church was another community where I could fulfill my desire to be seen and known.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   In my pride, I looked down on other kids who I thought were different than me
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   or who didn't fit what I thought was a Christian lifestyle.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   During my teenage years, God stripped away some of these worldly
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   sources of identity. I struggled academically
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   and had a hard time finding community during high school.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   During these years, I clung to the church, but not for Christ, but to be in a place
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   where I still felt seen and known by others.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   However, I believe God was still planting seeds in my life during this time.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   While I may not have been going to church out of a personal love for Christ, I remember
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   a lot of the counselors and youth leaders at my high school fellowship
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   who would challenge me to consider why I was going to church and what it truly meant
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   to have a personal walk with God. These were questions that stuck with me and challenged
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   me as I graduated and moved away for college.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   One day during my senior year of high school, I remember
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   praying for the one thing that I wanted most at that time.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   I asked God to provide me with close friends who knew me well and understood me.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   In my own pride, I was unsatisfied with the relationships
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   God had already placed in my life and felt like they didn't meet my own idealized
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   expectations. I believed that
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   this lack of community was the source of a lot of the hardships I was facing at that time.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   When I moved away for college,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I joined a Christian fellowship and initially thought that this was an answer to my prayers.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Here was a group of other Asian kids who grew up in church
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and had similar life experiences and values as me.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I gradually got involved in the community, began serving, and went out to every fellowship event.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   As my time in college went on, my idealized
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   view of this community began to fall apart. I found myself
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   falling into old patterns of growing dissatisfied with my relationships
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   and clinging to insecurities and prideful ways of thinking.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Once again, I began to question what was actually keeping me in church and with Christians.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   But by God's grace, this time He led me to His word
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and prayer as I struggled with these questions.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Through the encouragement of the church and just other people in my life, He led me to examine
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   sins of pride, apathy, and the fear of man, which I had not previously
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   acknowledged. Although I didn't have the words to express it at that time,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   God showed that I lacked a genuine love for the people in my life
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   and therefore for Him. 1 John 4:20
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   "If anyone says, 'I love God' and hates his brother, he is a liar.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen."
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   My idolization of community and relationships
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   to fulfill myself came out of a desire to fulfill myself,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   and this was a pursuit that could never fully satisfy me.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   This also led me to ignore the people that God had already placed in my life,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   even during my hardest seasons, and ultimately blinded me of His own love.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   For a long time, I never thought of myself as a very prideful
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   or selfish person, but God led me to realize that my sin went further
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   than I could ever know, and for that, I needed to surrender my life to Him.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   He showed me that true love cannot be found in any human relationship, but only through
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   the truth of the gospel. 1 John 3:16
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   "By this we know love, that Christ laid down His life for us."
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   The Christian walk is always a process, but in faith, I'm relying on God to help me grow in true humility,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   discipline, and love, both for other people
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   and for Him. Over the last few months, I've been thinking
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   about what it means to be baptized, and have come to understand that
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   it is a public expression ordained by God of a person's union with
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Christ through repentance and belief in Him.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Galatians 3:27 "For as many of you were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ."
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   And I recognize that this is not something I've done before,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and I'm sharing my testimony today as an act of obedience and an affirmation
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   before the church of what God has done in my life.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   One of my favorite passages in the Bible is Psalm 139, where David writes about
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   how intimately God knows him, and how He has planned out his life, even from before
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   he was born, according to His purpose. Whenever I read that passage,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   it reminds me of how God has purposefully shaped my life to draw me closer to Him,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   not because I deserved it or earned it, but by His grace.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   For a large part of my life, the one thing I wanted was to be seen and known by other people,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   but God has shown me that in Him, I have a Creator who has always
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   fully known me and loved me. He has used every experience,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   every struggle, and every relationship in my life to lead me to believe in and surrender
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   to Him. And for that, I'm truly grateful. Thank you.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   [applause]
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   [applause]
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   [applause]
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   [applause]
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   [applause]
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   [applause]
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   - If you understand, when you go into the water, you're being united to Christ's death, and then when you come out,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   you're being united to His resurrected life. - Yes.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   - I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   [applause]
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   [applause]
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   [applause]
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   [applause]
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   [applause]
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   - All right. Thank you
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   for that great testimony. If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 7,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   we're going to continue in our series. I'm going to be reading from
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   verse 36 to 39, but the text that we're
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   dealing with this morning will go all the way to verse 50.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Luke chapter 7, verse 36 through 39.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And reading out of the NASB. "Now one of the Pharisees
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   was requesting Him to dine with him, and he entered
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. And there was a woman in the city
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   who was a sinner, and when she learned that he was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   with her tears, and kept wiping them with the hair of her head,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   and kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfume. Now when the
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Pharisees who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, 'If this man were a
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   prophet, he would know who and what sort of person this woman is
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   who is touching him, that she is a sinner.'" Let's pray.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Father, we pray for
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   enlightenment. We pray that only Your Word, Lord,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   would go forth. We pray for hearts that are
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   eager, Lord God, to listen and to obey.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Help us, Lord God, that our eyes may be opened to see the glory
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   of Christ. May His name only be exalted.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   The text that we're looking at this morning really is a continuation of what
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   we saw last week, where we are told
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   by Luke that the reason why some people were
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   able to understand the teaching of John and
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Jesus was because they were baptized by John, meaning that they were baptized into
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   repentance. And the reason why the Pharisees couldn't understand is because
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   they did not repent. And so the distinction between somebody who
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   hears the Word of God and is affected by the Word of God, and there's a
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   change because of the Word of God, has a lot to do with
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   what you bring into when you hear the Word of God.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   So even this morning, if you came eager to hear the Word of God and
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   ready to receive it because you're willing to repent
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   of whatever sins that may be exposed, you're willing to follow Christ,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   but if you came into this room, "I want to kind of hear
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   and make my choice if I'm going to do it or not to do it," and you've already had that
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   in your heart, then no matter what comes off from this pulpit,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   you're going to gain knowledge, but there's no transformation that takes place.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Your ability to see God, your ability to hear
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   the Word of God is directly linked to, are you willing
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   to repent? Are you willing to change? Are you willing to
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   follow whatever the Word of God says? But if that is not there, your heart
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   is already hardened toward the Word of God. And so you'll hear it,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   you may be able to gain knowledge from it, but there's no transformation
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   that takes place. That's what it says in the previous text that we looked at last week.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   This text is an illustration of that. What does it look like
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   for a sinner who repents? And what does it
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   look like for a Pharisee who's unrepentant?
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   And what is the end result of that? So it really is, last
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   week's passage and this week's passage should be understood together because this week's passage
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   basically is telling us that when somebody who is unwilling to
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   repent, what that leads to, when somebody is willing to repent, what that leads to.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   So this morning I want to first look at Simon the Pharisee,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   who he is. First of all, I want to make it clear. If you're reading
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   through the New Testament, you'll find that there is another event that looks very similar to this event,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   but it is very different. It's different because this event happens in the beginning
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   of Jesus' ministry. That happens at the end, preparing him to go to the cross.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   This event looks similar because it's talking about Simon the
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Pharisee. There it's talking about Simon the leper. This
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   event happens where this woman is anointing his feet. That event
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   is anointing of his head. So one happens at the beginning of his ministry,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   another one happens at the end of the ministry. So I don't want you to be confused when you're reading through the New Testament.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   These are not two same events.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Well, this particular event exposes to us these two
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   people, a repentant sinner and an unrepentant sinner.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Simon the Pharisee, Luke chapter 7, 36, said, "Now one
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   of the Pharisees was requesting him to dine with him, and he entered the Pharisee's house
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   and reclined at the table." He invites
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Jesus to his house. The question is, was
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Simon the Pharisee, was he a believer? Is that why he asked
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Jesus to come to his house? Because he heard the teaching, and so he
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   wanted to, he recognized that this is the Messiah talking, so I want him at my
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   house. Well, we clearly see that he was not, because we see at the
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   end of verse 39 that after he encounters
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   this woman who anoints his feet, he gets disgusted with this event
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   and he says, "If this man were a prophet, he would know
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   who and what sort of person this woman is, and who is touching him, that she is
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   a sinner." So it clearly spells out
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   that not only did he not believe he was the Messiah,
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   he's not even sure if he was a prophet. So we
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   know he's not a believer. Then why did he invite Jesus to his home?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   What is the context of this? Because understanding the context
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   of this will help us to understand who he is and why he
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   ends up doing what he's doing. So the question is,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   what is the context of this? It clearly
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   seems like that this was an open event. He wasn't inviting Jesus because he was a believer.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   He was inviting Jesus because he was curious.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Jesus' fame is beginning to spread. Multitudes are starting
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   to come to Christ. A Pharisee was an individual who lived all his life
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   to gather multitudes around him, so his claim to fame
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   is to use the law to become somebody.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Somehow he's going to get closer to God, that he was the righteous one,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   and he used his religiousness to climb this ladder. So here's this
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   man, all of a sudden there's chatter that maybe could he be the Messiah, he's performing
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   miracles, and thousands are starting to come to him early on in ministry.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   So what it looks like is Simon the leper was
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   a looky-loose. Some of you guys who know what a looky-loose is. A looky-loose is
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   somebody who has no intention to buy, but is eye shopping.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   So a looky-loose, if you're going around checking out houses and you have
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   no down payment, and you have no timeline when you
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   want to buy, but you like looking at houses. Or, maybe
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   you're a window shopper. You don't have any money.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   You have no intention to buy anything, but you just like looking.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   Simon the Pharisee seems like
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   the reason why he wanted Jesus at his house is because
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   of Jesus' fame. And so maybe if he invited him to
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   his house, that he could somehow be associated with him, and maybe somehow
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   by being associated with him, that he would get some of the
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   attention. And the reason why I say that is that
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   even the invitation that he gave was not a private
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   invitation. If he really believed in Christ and wanted to have a private
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   hearing, you would think it would be a private event, but it was not.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   It was a very public event. In fact, later on in verse 49, it tells us that
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   there were other peoples reclining at the table. It was big
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   enough that a sinner, this woman who was a sinner, was able to come in.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   You would have never, that would have been scandalous, that a
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Pharisee would allow somebody like her to even enter into his house.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   So the context of this is that he throws basically
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   a big banquet. There's a bunch of people gathering here, and the whole purpose of that
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   is so that he can rub shoulders with him. That's the context. That's what we
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   see here, right, from this text. Not only that,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Jesus describes how he was
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   disrespected as a guest. In Luke chapter 7, 44-46, turning toward the woman,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house. You gave me no
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   water for my feet, but she has wet my feet
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   and with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. You do not
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   anoint my head with oil, but she anointed my feet with perfume."
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Every one of these acts was a courtesy,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   common courtesy that you gave to a guest, especially a special guest like Jesus.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   So the fact that he did none of this means that Jesus was not a
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   special guest to him. All he was doing was,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   a lot of people following him, get him to my house and invited
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   other guests to come and see. And so it would have been an insult
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   to have Jesus in his home and not to offer to wash his feet, not to
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   anoint his head, not to give him a brotherly kiss. But he said
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   you did none of that, meaning he was disrespected in his home. So we see
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   that the reason behind why Simon invited Jesus was not
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   because he was a seeker. He was genuinely seeking. He just wanted to
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   be around Jesus. Let me
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   take a moment here to highlight
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   some of the issues that a growing church has.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   When our church is small, you know, we don't get
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   a lot of people who come to church that's kind of like, "Ah, I just want to rub shoulders." And we have some.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   But as our church gets bigger, we tend to
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   and as it gets bigger, we tend to attract people simply because
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   we have pretty girls. We have decent looking guys.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   We have a children's program. We have guys
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   of certain age that do things together. We have Dodger fans. We have
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   people who like to play football. We have people who like to play
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   softball. And so there's a benefit of coming to church.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   And so not necessarily because you're hungry
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   to know Christ, but simply because there's benefits of coming
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   to church. And as a result of that, if we're not careful, we can fill
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   our churches with people who just want to rub shoulders
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   with other good, moral people who are, look like me, act like me,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   and have similar interests. But at the core of it, what's
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   binding people, the fellowship, isn't truly fellowship. It's just a gathering.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   And you can have people, church filled with
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   people who are not genuinely seeking Christ, who love the church, love the people,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   love the gathering, but their worship is
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   never any more genuine ten years later than when they first began, because that was
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   not what brought them to church. See,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   in Christ, as Jesus' ministry is growing,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   it was attracting all of these people coming to Him, even the leaders of Israel.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Even the leaders of Israel wanted to come and rub shoulders
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   with Christ, and that's why when the Pharisees showed up, John the Baptist
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   straight up said, "You brood of vipers."
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Because he knew, right away, that they didn't come to repent,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   they didn't come seeking Christ, they came because they saw
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   that he was becoming a religious celebrity.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Kind of like if you run into a celebrity out in the airport or something, and you're
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   quick to go over there and take a selfie with that person, and you put it on
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Instagram. Like, why do you put it on Instagram? You don't know this person.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Because some of the love that they gave, some of the glory that
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   they get by putting a picture up, it's like, "Hey, maybe some of it will rub up
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   on me. I met somebody important." I think that
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   that's the reason why Simon the Pharisee invited Jesus to his house, considering
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   the context of that. He was not genuinely interested in Him. He had
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   an unrepentant heart. This man was known to be,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   at least at that time, a religious leader.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   He was the guy that people would run to if they had questions about the Bible.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   He was the guy, if they had questions about how they should live,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   how to pray, how to give, how to serve at the temple, this is the guy that they
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   would have run to. And yet, we know that the greatest
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   rebuke was given to the leaders of Israel.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   And the reason why the greatest rebuke went to the leaders of Israel is because their sins
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   had greater consequences. It's one thing
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   for anybody else to sin, not that sin is sin no matter who commits sin,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   but when a leader commits sin, it prevents other people
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   from coming to Christ. And that's exactly what it says in Matthew 23, 13.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Jesus says, "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people, for you do not enter in
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   yourself, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in."
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   Because of your sin, because of your hypocrisy,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   it prevents other people to come to Christ.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   It is
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   the greatest danger to just anoint
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   anyone to come into ministry.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   Because of the consequence, the Bible says not many of you should become teachers because
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   there is greater judgment that comes upon you who says,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   "Stands between God and sinners, thus saith the Lord."
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   There's a greater temptation for leaders to be hypocrites because
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   we are judged by our action. The church looks at us and says,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   "Is he holy? Does he know the Bible? Does he pray? Does he do this and that?"
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   So there's a greater temptation for leaders to pretend
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   to be holy at church and to be unholy behind the scene.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   To be a certain way when people can judge us and when people can't see
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   we're a completely different person. In fact, in Luke chapter 11, 52
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   it says, "Woe to you, lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   You yourselves did not enter, and you hinder those who are entering."
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   He says, "The lawyers, they were the ones who were experts
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   of the law. These guys were the PhDs in theology." And he says,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   "You take away the keys of knowledge.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   They were the ones that were known for knowledge."
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   And he rebukes them and says, "No, you're not giving them knowledge." Because of your
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   hypocrisy, because of your unrepentance, in fact
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   even the very things that you're teaching is preventing people to come to them.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   You missed the whole point. And then I think
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   Matthew 23, 25-26 gives a summary of the danger
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   of false leadership. "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   for you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   full of robbery and self-indulgence. You blind Pharisees
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   first clean the inside of the cup and the dish so that the outside of it
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   may become clean also." You notice here the priority
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   of sanctification is inside.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   Inside. He said clean the inside so that it would affect
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   the outside. But a hypocrite is somebody
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   who is paying all the attention on how he's going to be judged
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   externally, but sanctification never happens internally.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Bitterness, anger, coveting, slander, none of that ever changes because
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   it's not obvious. And so we only pay
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   attention to something that people are going to judge immediately. If you have a foul
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   mouth, if you do something, if you go places you're not supposed to go.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   And so those things we've learned how to package it well,
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   but internally nothing is changing. No true sanctification is happening.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   So Jesus says, "You hypocrites, you pay so attention
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   to your appearance and your reputation, but there's no true sanctification."
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   He says, "Sanctify and clean the inside
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   so that whatever happens on the outside will be an
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   overflow of what happens on the inside." So the priority is
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   sanctification on the inside. But a hypocrite is somebody
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   who spends all his life presenting himself one way
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   while he never has clear conscience behind the scene.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   And Jesus rebukes them
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   repeatedly over and over. Now understand,
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   these two people are being compared.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   The sinner that everybody knew, that this Pharisee was
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   disgusted by even her being present in his home,
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   that that man, that religious, righteous, holy man,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   at least by reputation, him
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   and his partners were the ones who were rebuked the harshest.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   That because of their hypocrisy, people would not come to Christ.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   And he says greater judgment is coming upon him.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   That's why, you know, as our church gets bigger, there's a greater temptation.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   We need to plug in the holes. We need to get more people.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   But it is a great danger. It's easy
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   to place somebody into leadership, to plug up holes, to get the work done,
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   because there's a need. But it is far more
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   difficult of a task to remove somebody and wait
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   until they do the damage in order to remove them. I've learned
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   and I think pastors who have gone before me, who are wiser than I am,
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   have confirmed over and over again, it is better not to have leadership
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   than to have poor leadership. It's better to have
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   lack of leadership than to have bad leadership.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   So we try to be careful and there is a
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   greater temptation to just plug up the holes.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Because it makes things run smoother immediately,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   but it may explode in the future. There's a reason why the Bible
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   says that if a brother sins against you, go and tell him.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   If he doesn't repent, take another brother. And if he doesn't see that,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   then take it to the church. But it tells us that if an elder sins,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   and if there is an agreement that this sin is unrepentant,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   he says take it to the church. There's no process, you just take it to the church.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   Because of the damage that that person does. In order to protect the church
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   from the damage that the leader may do, he says to take it to the church.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   And that's why the Bible warns us. It warns us,
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   do not lay hands hastily. Make sure it's
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   not a brand new believer.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   Simon the Pharisee.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   His response clearly tells us that he was not a believer.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   But not only was he not a believer, his disgust toward this
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   lady. His disgust toward this lady. He comes
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   to Jesus like, if you're a prophet, how can you dare allow her to touch you?
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   And that was the response of these religious leaders of that time.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   Jesus actually turns the table. Not only did he
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   come for people like her, he turns the table around in
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   Luke chapter 15. He said, you don't know my father.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   If you don't understand why I'm with the tax collectors
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   and why I'm going after these sinners, you don't know my father.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   He gives a parable of the lost sheep and how he
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   goes out to get the one, comes back and they celebrate. How a lady
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   loses a coin, sweeps the whole house, finds it, and there's a huge celebration.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   And then he ends it with the bang with the prodigal son.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   When he comes back, there's celebration, he's restored, and all of that
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   is given to rebuke the Pharisee.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Not only did I come for the lost, you
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   don't know my father if you don't know why I came.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   Let's look at
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   this lady. In Luke chapter 7, 37-38
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   it says, "And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner, and when she
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   learned that he was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   vial of perfume, and standing behind him at his feet, weeping,
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   she began to wet his feet with her tears, kept wiping them with
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   the hair of her head, kissing his feet and anointing them with the
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   perfume." First of all, why
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   is she singled out as a sinner? Aren't we all sinners? And the Bible says,
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." But it says she was known as a sinner.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Remember in the previous passage it tells us that all these
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   people were able to acknowledge God's justice
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   and then it says the tax collector also. Well, the tax collector
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   is part of the all people. But the reason why they
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   selected to identify him as a tax collector, because
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   of his great sin. Not only just the regular people, but even this
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   vile sinner was able to recognize because he was willing to repent. So in the same way
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   here, all these people are gathered, but she was a
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   particular sinner. It doesn't tell us what that sin was, but most
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   commentators believe that because of how this word is used, particularly of this woman
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   and the way Simon the Pharisee reacts, most
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   commentators believe that she was probably a well-known prostitute in that area.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   It tells us that she recognized
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Jesus and he was reclining at the table, that she took
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   an alabaster vial and broke it
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   to show her adoration for Christ.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   You have to understand that that alabaster vial
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   would be similar to, let's say if you didn't trust a bank
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   and you wanted to make sure that you kind of had control over your wealth,
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   you may buy gold and bury it somewhere, right? So at that particular
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   time, a lot of them bought precious oil
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   that they put into an alabaster jar. So this
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   represented the hard work, the humiliation
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   that she endured in order to get this. The fact that when she
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   recognized that Jesus was where he was at,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   reclining at the table, and she had the alabaster jar
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   with her, tells us that most likely she was moving around
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   looking for him with the alabaster jar. This was not a by chance walking around.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   "Oh, I have my alabaster jar with me." Most likely she's been looking for him.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   And when she found out that he was at the banquet in an open
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   court, that she was able to sneak in. It tells us that as Jesus was
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   reclining at the table. Now, if you've ever seen
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   the portrait of Jesus at the Last Supper, they're seated
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   in a very western style, you know, seating with chairs and you have
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   people leaning over, Jesus in the middle, you've probably seen that, right? That is not an accurate
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   picture of what would have happened. At that particular time when they ate,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   they were literally, they were literally
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   leaning. And so they would, because it was an Asian culture,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   if you go to certain parts of the world, even to this day, they'll sit on the ground
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   and they'll have, you know, cushions on the ground, and typically the picture would have
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   been leaning with one elbow to the ground, and the rest of his body
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   leaning, and that's why his foot was stuck sticking out. That's probably a closer
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   picture of what a meal, a Passover meal would have looked like. And that's what it's
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   describing here. So you have all these people in the banquet, and maybe there's tables
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   everywhere on the ground, and, or maybe there's no table, the food
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   may be on the ground, and they're leaning toward the food with Jesus sliding,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   and when she sees an opportunity, she comes, and she breaks the jar
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   and begins to show her love
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   for Christ.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   You may look at that and say, well, I can understand why the
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Pharisee was so offended, right? Because in no other context
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   would a Pharisee would allow somebody who was a prostitute to be
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   near him. Not only would he have been disgusted, he would have considered
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   himself unclean just by her presence. Let alone have
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   her in my house, not only in my house,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   but to do what she did to Jesus, it disgusted
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   him. Sin is
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   a sin, no matter how you cut it. Sin can never be
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   excused. But how we respond to people's sin
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   may say a lot about how we understand that person.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   If somebody we love sins,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   yes, sin is sin. But how we respond
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   to somebody that we love, versus somebody we don't love,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   it's night and day. We want the full wrath of God
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   to come on somebody. They don't deserve this.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   As much as this Pharisee was disgusted
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   with her sin, Jesus shows compassion. Like I said,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   sin is a sin is a sin. But you have to
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   understand, in this particular time, a woman did not
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   choose to become a prostitute simply because she enjoyed
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   the work that she was doing. When a woman
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   was divorced by her husband and she can't remarry,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   there was no other recourse to survive.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   And if she had a child, the only way to feed that child is to sell her body.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   If a woman who didn't have a husband and, again,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   loses the only children that they have, many of them, no matter how old
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   they were, either them or they had to prostitute one of their children in order to do that.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   And Pastor Peter Chung told us stories about that. He wrote
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   a certain part to the world and how the dad or the mother would volunteer
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   their young teenage daughter to
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   prostitution because that was the only way to take care of their family.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   And I remember that one time when we were in the Philippines, and we were in
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   a nice hotel, and you could see a lot of middle-aged men,
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   50, 60 years old, hanging around with probably
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   they looked no more than 13 or 14-year-old young girls.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   So initially we thought it was strange because we weren't thinking about anything.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   And then we realized that these girls were coming to prostitute themselves to these guys.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   And they were having so much fun. And we would walk
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   out into the lobby and we could see these same girls who were laughing and partying
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   out in the lobby with dark faces.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   Because they themselves were disgusted with what they had to do.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   So they would come into the room and pretend like they're having fun
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   and then as soon as the guy is gone you could see in her demeanor how much she hated
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   what she was doing. And through that we realized
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   that, yeah, this is a really complex problem.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   Because many of these girls who are being
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   sex trafficked and doing this was volunteering
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   because that's the only way that they can survive.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   That's the only way that they can provide for their family.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   So as much as what these men were doing was vile,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   it's a lot easier to have compassion for these young girls
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   because of the situation that led them there. And, again, don't get me wrong.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Sin is sin is sin. But Jesus looks upon her with
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   compassion. And you could tell
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   that she's been so affected. Can you imagine
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   the humiliation that this girl, this lady, had to endure
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   to save that oil?
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   How many times that she was in front of
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   a male in heat abusing her
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   just so that she can save. And then that alabaster jar represented
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   all her humiliation, all the hard work.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   And she was waiting to break it for Jesus.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Jesus sees that.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   And knowing what this Pharisee was thinking,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   it says to him in Luke chapter 7,
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   40 to 43, "Jesus answered him, 'Simon, I have something
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   to say to you.' And he replied, 'Say it, teacher.'
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   A moneylender had two debtors, one owed 500 denarii,
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   and the other 50. When they were unable to repay, he graciously forgave them both.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   So which of them will love him more?' Simon answered and said, 'I suppose
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   the one whom he forgave more.' And he said to him, 'You have judged correctly.'"
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   Now, you know what's interesting is that word "suppose,"
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   right? You know, a lot of times you see the translation and they would add
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   certain words to kind of brighten up or make it
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   make more sense. That word actually exists in the Greek, "suppose." And that word
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   "suppose," if you read the
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   Greek definition of that, it is "questioning."
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   It is not a confident answer. It's like, "You are correct."
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   It's, "I guess." It's when somebody has no other
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   recourse but to admit, "I can't deny
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   it's there." That's basically what he's saying. He doesn't like where
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   Jesus is taking this. Because Jesus sees his heart and his disgust,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   and because of that, he's questioning even Jesus, and he turns the table around.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   What she's doing is expressing her love for me because
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   so much has been forgiven her.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   Now, the question is, is Jesus
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   saying that if you want to love Jesus, if you want to obey
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   the greatest command, first be a prostitute.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   I have nobody in here saying yes.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   Of course that's not what he's saying. He's not saying because so much has been forgiven her.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   And a Pharisee doesn't have a lot of sins to be forgiven.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   And that's why he's not able to love him.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   But because she was a prostitute, she understands. Is that what he's saying?
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   As crazy as this is, I've actually heard a pastor say that.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   He said, "We need to experience the world, and we need to
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   know," because Jesus said, "If you want to love God, you need to know
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   sin intimately."
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   I'm not exaggerating. I've actually heard a pastor say that.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   Is that what he is saying? Of course not.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   What he is saying is, she recognized
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   her sins. She probably lived every day, and
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   everybody reminded her, so she knew. Jesus didn't have to convince her.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   She knew. That's why she was carrying this
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   jar around, looking for Jesus, for an opportunity to thank him.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   But the Pharisee was blind. Even though he had a
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   reputation of godliness, he was further away than the tax
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   collectors and this prostitute. Imagine how offensive that would
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   have been to a Pharisee's ear. Where his whole life he'd been
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   living to gain the reputation of godliness, and Jesus says,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   "They will enter the kingdom of heaven before you. Your
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   sins are much more vile than you recognize."
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   Many
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   people who grew up in the church say, "I never
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   strayed. I never sold drugs. I never did prostitution."
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   I don't know. The greatest
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   sin that has the greatest damage are the ones that we
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   don't see. Or the ones that we
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   don't see. If you ever buy a house, or if you're renewing your
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   insurance in the house, there's two things that
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   every insurance company, every realtor will tell you you have to have.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   What are those two things? One, fire alarm.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   You need to have a fire detector. What's the other one?
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   You haven't renewed your insurance recently.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   Carbon monoxide detector. Up to about 15 years ago,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   carbon monoxide detector was not mandatory. They suggested it, but it was not
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   mandatory. You have to have it, or they're not going to give you the insurance.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   Now, fire detector, it's like, "Oh, okay. That's good.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   That's useful, because if a fire breaks out, I'd like to know."
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   Because fire is obvious. You're going to feel the heat. The smoke's going to come up.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   But the carbon monoxide, according to the
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   study, 2,600 people die of fire each year.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   2,100 die by carbon monoxide, so it's almost
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   equal. We can see why a fire detector
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   would be necessary, but carbon monoxide,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   I've never even smelled it before. Why do we need it? It's almost irritating that they make
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   us get it. It's because the danger of the carbon monoxide that
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   we're not even aware of, you go to sleep, and if it affects you, you just don't wake up.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   It says equal number of people die of carbon monoxide
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   than the fire. The sins
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   that we have excused, that we have swept under the rug,
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   sins that are common, that
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   other people struggle with, that doesn't seem that
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   sinful, is what erodes and kills
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   professing Christians. See, the problem with the
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   Pharisee is that he did not recognize his sin. As vile,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   and as dirty, and as filthy as it was in God's eyes,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   he himself did not recognize how far he was from God, and therefore
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   when Christ came, he didn't see a need for a Savior. He needed a
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   conqueror. He needed a king, but he didn't need a Savior.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   On the other hand, this woman broke what was
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   the most valuable to her, and they poured it out.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   And it would have been scandalous for a woman at that time,
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   not only to break the oil, but for her to let
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   her hair down. In the Talmud,
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   in the Jewish teaching, it says that if a woman puts her hair down in front
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   of another man, that that's grounds for that man to divorce his
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   wife. Because it was considered scandalous, that you were just being free
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   in front of another man. And then, on top of that,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   she was kissing his feet.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   Now you have to understand that feet was the dirtiest part of the
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   human being at that particular time, and it was reserved for the lowest
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   of the servants, to even clean their feet.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   So this woman not only breaks the jar, she
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   loses their hair, and uses her hair to wash his feet, and she's
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   kissing it in adoration. Now we may look at that and say, "Oh yeah, that's scandalous."
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   But look, from her point of view, she was so
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   thankful to Jesus.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   She wasn't thinking about her reputation, she wasn't thinking about what other people were going to think, she wasn't thinking
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   about how other people were going to respond to her. She just wanted him to know!
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   She wanted him to know how much
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   you mean to me! That's what true worship looks like.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   Whenever, if you're in a game,
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   again, in a secular way, if you're watching a game
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   and your team ends winning the championship,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   and every fan of that team is elated
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   and they get up, they give high fives, they're not saying, "I can't give a high five to you because we
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   didn't come in together." You're not, "Hey, so I can't high five you."
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   We're not in the same bracket, we have different opinions of things. No, when
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   true worship breaks out, you lose yourself. You forget
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   who you are. You might have starved for three days, but you're going to forget at that moment.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   You might have hated this guy who's sitting next to you, but because he's wearing the same
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   Dodgers hat, he's your brother. All of a sudden. That's what true worship looks like.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   So much of our worship is
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   clouded because we're concerned about what are they going to think?
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   If I pray out loud, what are they going to think? If I stand up and clap, what are
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   they going to think? If I sing too loud, what are they going to think? And so much of our free
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   expression of our love for Christ is hindered because
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   we're overly concerned about other people. True worship looks like her.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   She's not thinking about anything other than, "I want Jesus to know.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   I want him to know how much he's meant to me." Can you imagine this woman
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   who, everywhere she went, right? I mean,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   no different than a leper. If she comes, "Get out, that sinner. Here comes that sinner.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   How did she get in here? How can you dare let her touch you?"
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   She went from that to Jesus
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   saying, "You're saved. You're saved."
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   That is the touch of Christ.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   That's genuine salvation. How do we come
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   to know our sins? One, it doesn't matter. If you
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   encounter the holy, holy, holy God, automatically
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   you're fully aware of your sins. Just like Isaiah
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   in Isaiah chapter 6. Here's a man who's called to represent him to
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   Israel. A man who, in every other respect, he would have been a
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   holy man, but as soon as he encounters God, what does he say? "Woe
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   is me. Woe is me." In light of his
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   holiness, all of a sudden he realized how vile his sin is.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   An individual who lives day-to-day
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   living in sin and not recognizing how vile
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   that is has not encountered God.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   Not the God of the Bible. Maybe God of the culture, but not God of the Bible.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   Because the first thing that happens when we encounter this God,
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   and you see it in every instance of the Bible, when somebody encounters this God,
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   they fall to the ground, say, "Woe is me!"
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   And they're fully aware. So this Pharisee
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   never encountered that God. That's why
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   a Christian man who claims to have met God and is filled with pride
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   is a contradiction.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   How can you be in the presence of this holy God? How can you have met this holy
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   God and be filled with pride?
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   The other way that we recognize the depth of our sin
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   is striving for holiness. See, an individual
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   who has accepted a nominal Christian life does not understand
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   how far he is because he's accepted it. "It's too hard, so
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   I'm just going to live my life right here." So because
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   you've chosen to make this your goal, you don't know how far
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   you are from God. But any individual
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   who makes any effort to live a life
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   that is holy, "Lord, search me and know me. See if there's any hurtful ways
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   in me." Immediately, they're confronted with their sins.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   That this sin is much deeper than you thought.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   This sin has affected you much more
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   than you realize. You are far more desperate than you've ever known.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   But an individual who's not striving for holiness will never come to that
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   conclusion because he's never strived. See, a man who
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   has encountered God, and because of this encounter
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   he is striving to be sanctified, inevitably
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   comes to the conclusion, "I'm a desperate man
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   in need of a Savior. That my greatest need
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   is His forgiveness.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   My greatest need is not for my bank
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   account to be full, or my children to be healthy, or that I get the job that I
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   want, or a relationship to go okay. My greatest need, every sinner's greatest need
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   if our eyes become open, is
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   my own sins." That's what
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   this man, because he was unwilling to repent, he could not
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   recognize his own sin. And here's this woman,
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   a known prostitute, and the example
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   of true worship comes from her, not from him.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   And here's an interesting question, Luke 7, 49, after all this happens, it concludes
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   by saying, "Those who are reclining at the table with him began to say to themselves,
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   'Who is this man who even forgives sins?'"
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   Let me ask you, how do you read that?
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   Let me give you two ways that you could read this.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   After seeing everything that Jesus has done, and Jesus says, "Your faith has
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   saved you. Your sins are forgiven,"
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   is the response from the people,
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   "Who is this man? How dare he say he
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   can forgive sins? Only God can forgive sins. Who is this man?"
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   Are they saying this because they're offended, or
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   are they amazed? How can this man
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   forgive sins? Who is this man? Do you understand
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   the distinction between the two? So let me ask you, how many of you think
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   that this is the first one? How dare he? Is that what they're
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   responding? Is he mimicking
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   Simon the Pharisee? How dare he? Who is this man who's forgiving
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   sin? How many of you think that that's what's happening? Raise your hand.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   How many of you think it's the other where
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   they're amazed? He can forgive sins? Who is this man?
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   How many of you think that that's the case?
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   How many of you don't want to get it wrong? That's most of you.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   Let me give you the answer.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   This is the answer. I don't know.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   Because it doesn't say.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   So how you answer that question, how you answer my question, may be a revelation of your
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   heart. I'm just kidding. I don't know.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   From this text, I don't know. Because it doesn't explain.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   But how you ask this question
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   and how you answer this question, the consequence
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   is night and day. If the question is
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   how dare a man, just a mere man,
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   claim to forgive sins?
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   How dare you do that?
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   If you don't believe him, he's just
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   a man who's going around saying that he came to forgive
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   sins. Jesus has ruined more lives
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   than any other human being that has ever lived
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   on earth. Think about the sacrifices that you have made.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   Think about the missionaries. Think about the people who got martyred.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   Think about his closest companions. Every single one of them suffered
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   and lost everything they had because they believed that Jesus came to forgive
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   sins. Think about the countless number of people.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   Millions, possibly billions of people who gave their lives
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   big and small because they
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   believed what Jesus said. So I can understand
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   why the communists think that religion is an opiate
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   of the masses. Because if you believed him, you
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   can't pursue what is true. You've been lied to.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   If that's the question, and if that's the final
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   conclusion, or
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   who is this man?
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   How can he forgive sins? How can he allow
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   a vile sinner like a tax collector
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   and this prostitute to forgive
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   her of her sins? How can he turn this curse around?
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   He can do that.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   He can do that. Even the vilest of sinners, he can forgive them.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   And if your conclusion is, yes, he was more than just a man.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   He is exactly who he said he was.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   Then for the rest of our lives, we are to worship him
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   in spirit and in truth. Who is this man?
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   Why would he have done this? Why would he sacrifice?
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   Why would he who knew no sin become sin so that you and I can become
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   the righteousness, even her, even the tax collectors?
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   Who is this man? You notice
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   there is no middle ground to this? There is no middle
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   ground. There is no third answer.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   There is no how vile, how dare
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   he do this, or wow,
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   why did he do this? And then the middle ground is, oh well.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   He could or he could not be.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   You see why the harshest rebuke
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000]   in Revelation is the lukewarm
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   who is pretending.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   Who is pretending to know Christ. Whether you are a leader
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   in the church or whether you are just a congregant, that self
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   deception of claiming to know Christ while you don't.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   Why the greatest rebuke went
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   to the Pharisees.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   So the conclusion of the matter is this. What is being
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   illustrated for us? To know Christ and to
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   reject Christ. Love Christ
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   or hate Christ. Proclaim Christ
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   or live the rest of your life like you never heard it.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   There is no middle ground.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   So let me ask you again. How do you ask this question?
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   Who is this man? A mere
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   man who has deceived millions of people.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   Ruined people's lives because they gave everything they
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   had to follow this fake man.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   Or who is this man? Why would he do
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   this for us? Why would he do this for us?
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   And to live the rest of your life proclaiming his
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   glory to as many people as possible.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   Choose you this day whom you will serve.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   Let's pray.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   Father.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   You are deserving of our praise.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   You are deserving of our lives.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   You are deserving of our eternity.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   Help us to recognize the precious gift that we have in Christ.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   That we would be like this woman.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   Completely lost in worship.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   We can't help but to worship. To praise your
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   name. To worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   Open our eyes Lord God.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   That we would not stay in mediocrity.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   Give all that we have. That we may
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   serve you, worship you, and honor you.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   As you've given all that you have for us. May Christ
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   and Christ alone be magnified. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   Would you all stand up with me for the closing praise?
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   Amazing grace.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   Amazing grace.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   How sweet the sound.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   That saved a wretch
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   like me.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   I once was
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   lost but now
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   am found. Was blind
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   but now I see.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   'Twas
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   grace that taught
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   my heart to fear.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   And grace my
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   fears relieved.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000]   How precious
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   did that
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   grace appear
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   the hour I first
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   believed.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   Through many
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   dangers, toils
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000]   and snares I have
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   already
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   come. 'Tis
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   grace has brought
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   me safe thus far
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   and grace will
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   lead me home.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000]   When we've
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   been there ten
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   thousand years,
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   bright shining as
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   the sun.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   We've no less
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   days to sing
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   God's praise than when
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   we first begun.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   I once was lost.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   I once was lost
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   but now am found.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   Was blind
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   but now I see.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   Let's pray.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   and eternal love of God the Father
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000]   challenge us, rebuke us, inspire
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   us that we may worship
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   in spirit and in truth. Lord help us.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   Help us Lord God that we may have a clear sight of the glory
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ. That we would be changed.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   That we would know that this is not our home.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000]   That Christ is coming one day.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   That we may be glorified with him.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   Help us Lord God to number our days. Help us to see
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   that even in our suffering that it is temporary.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   That glory is coming. Salvation is coming.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   Eternity is coming. That we would invest all that we have
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   for the eternity that you have promised. May Christ's name be
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   magnified. May this world know
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   through us, through our lips, through our lives that there is
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000]   only hope in the name of Jesus Christ.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   Exalt yourself through the church this week. In Jesus name we pray.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   Amen.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   God sent his son
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   They called him
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   Jesus He came
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   to love
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000]   He'll never give
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   He lived and
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   died to
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   by my pardon
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   An empty grave is there
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   to keep my Savior
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000]   lives
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   Because he lives
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   I can face tomorrow
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   Because he
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   lives All fear
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   is gone
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   Because I know
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   He holds the future
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   And life
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   is worth the living
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000]   Just because he lives
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   Amen.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000]   Amen.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   Amen.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000]   Pardoned from his sin
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.580]   (upbeat music)
