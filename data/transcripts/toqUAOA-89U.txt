[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.980]   There are seasons when life wearies us, when it seems like we're too tired and busy for
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.620]   any kind of meaningful engagement with our Bibles, such is the current situation for
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.620]   Elena who writes us today.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.740]   "Hello Pastor John, I live alone, I work long weeks, I find it nearly impossible to
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.780]   keep up with my Bible reading.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.140]   Cooking, cleaning, exercising, running errands, getting food, shopping, on and on, and by
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.460]   the time I get home I'm exhausted.
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.260]   I schedule times to read my Bible, to pray, and to be alone with God, but I feel as if
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.740]   I'm only giving God 15 minutes of my day, and I don't want that.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.540]   But I have to pay the bills to live.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.540]   I feel stuck.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.380]   When I'm reading my Bible, I'm half asleep.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.260]   The only time I get now is in the weekends, but that's not enough.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.660]   In what practical ways can I beat back the busyness of my life to ensure that I make
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.620]   time for Him?"
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.700]   I hear Elena putting her finger on three things that are frustrating her time with God in
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.080]   the Word.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.540]   One is that she feels stuck.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.740]   Second, she feels exhausted, like she's going to fall asleep when she's reading her Bible.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.940]   And third, she's incredibly busy with many, many pressures pushing the Bible out to the
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.540]   edge of her life.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.620]   Let me say a word about those.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.660]   Just a word about being stuck.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.340]   I watch people get stuck in the snow outside my house.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.520]   They live on a corner, so they have to stop and then pull out into the street.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.800]   Some people sit there in the same place for 10 minutes.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.040]   I'm looking out there, so okay, I'm just going to get out there and push them.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.160]   But they just spin, spin, and spin as though doing the same thing over and over and over
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.440]   again is going to get out of stuckness.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.040]   Snow is part of the problem, but just doing the same thing over and over again is also
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040]   part of the problem.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.520]   So getting unstuck might require putting it in reverse, kind of counterintuitive back,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.280]   forward, and rock that thing out of there.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.120]   Or shoveling, you get out, shovel the snow away from front of your drive wheels.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.880]   Or you might bring the doorbell of the Pipers and say, "You got any men here?"
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   Which has happened.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.080]   My sons and I have pushed a lot of people out of the snow.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.760]   So the point is getting stuck requires some sometimes counterintuitive new efforts.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.600]   So what might that be in relation to busyness and exhaustion?
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.400]   Elena lists cooking, cleaning, exercising, running errands, getting food, shopping.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:00.440]   Now those sound to me like classic, good, valuable things that tend to fill up your
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.760]   life.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.300]   And Jesus was in the house of a couple of women who were different in their response
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   to these things.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.680]   You remember what I'm talking about, Luke 10, 40.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.780]   Martha was distracted with much serving, and she went up to the Lord and said, "Lord,
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.800]   do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?"
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.120]   And Elena says she lives alone.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.360]   "Tell her then to help me."
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.960]   But the Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.280]   One thing is necessary.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.960]   Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken from her."
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.880]   Now I know Elena says, "Look, I got to pay my bills."
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.720]   That's what she says.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.320]   But I think if Jesus visited her home and watched her schedule, he would probably point
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.160]   to some things and say, "No, that doesn't have to consume quite that much time.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.080]   No, you don't have to devote that much time and energy to that.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.580]   One thing is needful.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.680]   More needful than your pattern of cooking, more needful than your pattern of cleaning,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.440]   more needful than your pattern of exercising, more needful than your pattern of errand running
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.400]   and shopping, it's just plain more needful."
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:35.920]   And in Luke 8, 14, Jesus warns about the way the Word is choked by ordinary good busyness,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   right?
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:45.880]   He says, "And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear the Word, but as they
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:55.520]   go on their way, they're choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life."
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.040]   Cares of life, oh my, don't we all have them?
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.760]   And their fruit does not mature.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.120]   And then he reminds us, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.200]   out of the mouth of God."
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.000]   So my encouragement is for Elena to sit down and maybe make a list of the way she's spending
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   her life.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.800]   We've already got it itemized in this question she sent to us, the details of her life that
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.540]   seem to be robbing her of what she really wants to do.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.820]   And she should ask about each one.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.960]   Is it the way I do it the best way, and is it more important than spending time with
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.700]   God in His Word?
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.280]   Is there a way to readjust the time spent on these things to make time for the Word?
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:50.920]   And very specifically, I would say, maybe set your alarm 45 minutes earlier in the morning
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.800]   and take your usual shower, get dressed, put the Word of God before any busyness at all.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.440]   Don't leave the Word to fill the cracks.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.960]   Force other things into the cracks.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.760]   They will get done.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   You will pay your bills if you read your Bible, you will, I promise you.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.080]   Closely related to this is weariness, especially if you get up 45 minutes earlier, right?
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.440]   She's probably shaking her head right now, saying, "Are you kidding me?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.560]   I'm already dead tired."
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.440]   Closely related is this issue of weariness, falling asleep when you read your Bible, and
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.280]   who hasn't done that?
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.680]   Three practical suggestions.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:38.400]   One, go to bed earlier than you usually do at night in order to feel more rested, especially
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.960]   for the Word.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.880]   You can force yourself to go shopping when you're tired.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.740]   You probably can't force yourself to stay awake when you're tired, but you can go shopping
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.400]   when you're tired.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.280]   Second, in the morning, if you have to, go ahead and make your coffee and let that caffeine
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   do its magic.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.640]   I don't drink coffee, but I get what caffeine does.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.840]   I can drink Coke and tea.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.600]   Third, I have done this hundreds of times.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.080]   If your body insists on getting sleepy, take your Bible in your hand and get up out of
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:26.960]   your comfortable chair and walk around the room in circles reading your Bible.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.920]   There's nothing sacred about sitting, and it's much harder to fall asleep while you're
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   walking.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.480]   I did it just the other day.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.800]   But perhaps more important than these nitty-gritty practical suggestions is the foundational
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.000]   experience of the Word of God is more precious than anything.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.880]   Remind yourself of this by preaching Psalm 19.10 to yourself.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.280]   Preach it to yourself.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.840]   The ordinances of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:10.240]   More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.480]   drippings from the honeycomb.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:23.200]   So don't let gold and don't let food feel more valuable or more sweet than the Word
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   of God.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   They're not.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   No, they are not.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.440]   Great thoughts here, Pastor John.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   Thank you, Elena.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.200]   Thanks for the great question.

[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:48.120]   Well, today we talked about Bible reading and the challenges of life, which leads to
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.320]   another question.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.680]   At what point does our Bible neglect become sinful neglect?
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   Question arrived from Germany.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   It's a good one.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.960]   It's on the table Wednesday when we return.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   I'm Tony Reinhke, your host.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.640]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   [END]
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   1.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.640]   What is the purpose of the Bible?
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   2.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.640]   What does it mean to you that God is the Lord?
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.640]   3.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.640]   Why do you believe in God?
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.640]   4.
