[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 19.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.160]   And I'm just going to read from 41 through 44, because I'm going to be dealing with not
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.080]   just this text, but the other Gospels about Palm Sunday.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.900]   Luke chapter 19, 41 through 44.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.720]   When he approached Jerusalem, he saw the city and wept over it, saying, "If you had known
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.080]   this day, even you the things which make for peace, but now they have been hidden from
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.080]   your eyes.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.760]   For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.440]   you and surround you and hem you in on every side.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.720]   And they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.880]   leave in you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation."
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.880]   Let's pray.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.480]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your patience.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.080]   We thank you, Lord God, that only by your grace that we're able to be sustained, persevere.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.480]   Lord, we need you desperately.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.740]   Help us, Lord God, to have our eyes open, to see you as you are.
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.280]   We pray, especially this week, help us, Lord, to recalibrate our thoughts, our mind, our
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.940]   lives, that we may not drift.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.360]   Help us, Lord God, to be able to confess our love for you, not simply with words, but
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.200]   with our lives.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.800]   May this week be a blessing, Lord God, upon your church, as we are blessed and reminded
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.600]   that we would return it, Lord God, to you in glory and worship and praise.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.020]   Amen.
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.300]   As I mentioned, this week, this Passion Week, is set apart so that our natural tendency
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.860]   to drift, that we could catch ourselves.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.840]   So we've been studying the book of Hebrews, and the first two chapters is a warning against
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.680]   the church to simply not to neglect our salvation.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.120]   You don't have to do anything to drift.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.380]   Drifting just simply means you sat on the boat and you're just enjoying the current.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.920]   And when you do that, you find yourself a day, two days, a month, a year later, you
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.900]   find yourself so far and distant from God.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.320]   And the word of God that you confess to believe is God's word no longer has any effect in
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.300]   your life.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.860]   Songs that you sing are just songs.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.320]   The gathering of the church is just a social place.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.800]   You've lost your purpose, you've lost your drive, you've lost your passion for Christ.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.440]   And it didn't happen because a particular event, it didn't happen because you confess
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.760]   and say, "You know, I don't know if I believe this or not."
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   You just got caught up with life, and you began to drift, and you didn't catch yourself
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.240]   when you saw your heart getting hardened.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.800]   That's why times like these are important for us as a church.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.440]   To take some time to reflect, take additional time to catch.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.620]   If I've been drifting away from Christ, to take a deeper look about what he has done
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.760]   and what that means to us.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.520]   So hopefully by the end of the week, that again, that we would recalibrate our thoughts,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.320]   our mind, our lives, that we would live our life in a reasonable response to the things
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.240]   that we confess.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.560]   Palm Sunday is a day that we typically celebrate the coming of the Messiah into Jerusalem.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.440]   But we already know what happens at the end of this week.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.360]   This huge celebration turns into the crucifixion of Christ, where the disciples were scared,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.240]   they're scattering, and it leaves the community in utter confusion until the resurrection.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   And then even after the resurrection, there's a lot of confusion, but the disciples are
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.360]   sent out.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.720]   So we know what happens today, and we know how it concludes.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.080]   You know, if you look at the Ten Commandments, the first commandment is, "Thou shalt have
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.760]   no other gods before me."
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.240]   And it's the first and the most important commandment, because this was a commandment
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.960]   that a lot of the world was struggling with.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.800]   At the core of human rebellion is desiring to worship a god of their own creation.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.480]   But the second commandment is a commandment that I think is more tangible, that people
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.440]   wrestle with more.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.000]   Remember what the second commandment is?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.760]   "Thou shalt have no graven images, and worship it."
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.000]   Don't make graven images.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.440]   Don't make God in a graven image and then worship it.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.040]   If you look at it initially, it sounds redundant, doesn't it?
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.200]   It basically sounds like, "Don't worship any other gods," and then, "Don't worship any
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.960]   other gods in the images."
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.480]   Why is that commandment there?
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.960]   Because every single one of the Ten Commandments is very unique.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.520]   But why the second commandment?
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.360]   Why does it seem like it repeats the same thing?
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.680]   Is it simply because worshipping other idols is important, and so he says it twice in a
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.200]   different manner for repetition?
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.080]   When I looked at it a bit more carefully, I realized the second commandment is probably
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.600]   the most tangible, is the most realistic and most practical of all the commandments.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.520]   Because if you look at the church, how many of you really wrestled with the temptation
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.120]   of being a Buddhist?
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.060]   Maybe some of you guys came from a Buddhist background and you converted.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.520]   But after your conversion, in your walk with God, how many of you at even one time wrestled
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.840]   with, "Maybe I want to be a Hindu."
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.240]   Or, "I wrestled with wanting to be a Muslim."
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.000]   Now there are stories of very few people who may have walked with God at one point and
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.280]   converted to the Islamic faith or became a Buddhist.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:58.320]   But for the most part, 99.9% of professing Christians don't wrestle with this thought.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.000]   When God says, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.820]   So we don't wrestle with that, for the most part.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.320]   That is not something that we have a conversation.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.000]   I don't think I've talked to a single person in the years that I've been in ministry trying
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.500]   to convince somebody not to convert to Buddhism or something else.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.120]   But the second commandment, "Thou shalt have no other graven images and worship it," is
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.480]   a commandment basically prohibiting worshipping God in your way.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.200]   To declare God as God, but then creating this God into your image and worshipping a God.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.360]   You may be calling him God, you may be calling him Yahweh, you may be calling him Jesus,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.400]   but the Jesus that you follow or the people follow is a Jesus that they've created in
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.960]   their own mind.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   That's where the rubber meets the road for most of us.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.320]   You can confess Christ and you can sing songs about the gospel, but the way that we live
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:05.080]   our life, the way that we live our life, we can see that it is not the Christ of the Bible
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.720]   that is being worshipped, but it is a Christ that we've created in our own mind.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.880]   So I say, "You know what?
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.360]   I want a God who forgives us of sins, and no matter what I do, he forgives."
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.560]   And so they live their life pursuing the world, and then they've embraced certain aspects
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.020]   of who Jesus is.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.400]   And then when the Bible begins to talk about warning about sin and about judgment, it's
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.600]   like, "Well, that can't be the God that I worship."
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.200]   And so the Jesus that is being worshipped is a Jesus that they've created in their own
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.760]   mind, but it's not the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.360]   We can be in danger in the other direction where Jesus is just a moralist and looking
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.280]   at everybody's behavior, "You're not doing this right, you're not doing that right,"
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.640]   and constantly thinking that they're going to earn their righteousness before God, not
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.120]   realizing that it is not by our righteousness.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.520]   We cannot possibly get to God by our own righteousness, and that's why he came.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.760]   And so the God that you may worship at that end is also not the God of the Bible.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.320]   He is a God who is perfectly righteous and perfectly gracious at the same time.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.600]   And any God that you've created, that you and I have created, that doesn't fit the God
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.160]   of the Bible, it is not the God that we're talking about here.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:23.000]   And the reason why I mention all this is because the Jews had an idea of who the Messiah was
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.120]   going to be.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.160]   They were so excited about Jesus coming in that we call this Palm Sunday because palm
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.520]   branches were shaken and put on the ground, much like the way that we would celebrate
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.200]   at homecoming of a victorious army.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.840]   We don't see that when we see the soldiers coming back from the Vietnam War or the other
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.640]   wars, but you probably saw footages, black and white footages of World War II after they
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.960]   defeated the Nazis, and you see confetti coming down all over Manhattan, and the soldiers
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.840]   are waving their hands.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.900]   And so the palm branches, waving the palm branches was their version of confetti being
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.120]   thrown to celebrate victory.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.800]   Now up to this point, nothing has happened yet, but there was that kind of excitement
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.920]   of Jesus coming, they already knew.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.400]   This man raises people from the dead, he walks on water, he tells the storm to calm down
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.460]   and it stops.
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:29.080]   If there was anybody that was going to give them hope, it was Jesus.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.920]   And he made that very clear when he came in riding on a donkey because that was a fulfillment
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.320]   of a prophet that was given over 500 years before he showed up, that when the Messiah
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.360]   comes, he will come to you like a king riding on a donkey.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.200]   So he was declaring to the nation of Israel that he was that Messiah, he was that king
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.240]   who came to fulfill that promise.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.080]   But not only were they shaking the palm branches, in Matthew 21 verse 8 it says they took their
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.920]   cloaks and laid it on the ground.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.360]   What that basically meant was that they were surrendering their lives to this king.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.120]   The cloaks, remember, the cloaks at that time, most people, if they owned one, only owned
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   one.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.240]   So to take that and put it on the ground basically means that they're surrendering.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.120]   We want you to be our king.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.000]   You could imagine the excitement.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.080]   In fact, in Matthew chapter 21 verse 10, Matthew describes the crowd as being stirred up.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.920]   The word for stirred up in Greek is "saizo" where we get the word seismic.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.960]   Basically he's describing a shaking of the ground.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.920]   Now this was all taking place during the Passover week, where even without the excitement of
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.840]   Messiah coming into town, it was the Passover week, it was the Jewish Independence Day.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.520]   So even in a regular Passover week, there would be, according to Jewish historians,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.960]   over a million people gathered there.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.480]   But now because of this extra excitement of Christ coming in, and especially right before
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.520]   he enters, he raises Lazarus from the dead, and this word began to spread.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.840]   And so now people are coming into town to see if Jesus really is this Messiah that everybody's
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.320]   been talking about.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.120]   And did he actually raise Lazarus, a prominent member of a prominent family?
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   Was he actually raised?
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.400]   So we don't know exactly what the number is, but if the average number was over a million,
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.320]   can you imagine what the crowd was like?
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.960]   So to say that there was a stir, an excitement over Jesus' coming, it would probably be an
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.280]   understatement.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.600]   But to really understand the excitement of the nation of Israel, you have to understand
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.840]   the history.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.960]   When was the last time that you really wanted something and you had to wait for it?
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.140]   And the excitement of the day that when it came.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.080]   Maybe when you were a teenager and you were going to get a car, and it could have been
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.880]   a piece of junk, but you were waiting because that car represents freedom, and maybe you
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.800]   went to go get it, or maybe you were going to get it, a used car, whatever it may be,
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.360]   to you it meant freedom, and you had to wait.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.760]   You got to get your license.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.840]   So you remember what it was like, right?
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.320]   Whatever it may be, maybe it was your wedding day, maybe it was the coming of a child, first-born
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.840]   child, maybe it was a vacation, whatever it may be, it's something that you really long
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.240]   for that was actually going to happen.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:33.280]   So you can imagine or relate to a small degree possibly what the nation of Israel may have
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.320]   gone through.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.120]   You have to remember that Israel was a covenant people.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.920]   As soon as they started, when God started, God had a specific purpose for the nation
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   of Israel.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.320]   God promised Abraham and his descendants that he was going to bless them, make their land,
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.960]   he's going to give them land, he's going to give them descendants that they can count,
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.920]   and then through them he was going to bless all the other nations.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.360]   There was a very special covenant anointing upon Israel and their descendants.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:09.200]   That's why when you read the story of Jacob and Esau, remember Jacob is a slippery one,
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.360]   he comes and he kind of maneuvers and gets his older brother to give him his birthright,
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.760]   and Esau being a hunter comes in and he's hungry and famished, and because he wants
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.320]   the porridge, he said, "Well, what is my birthright to me when I'm going to starve to death?"
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.920]   It's a little bit dramatic, right?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.120]   And so he trades his birthright in order to get the porridge, and as a result of that,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.920]   there's a curse that comes upon him and his descendants for centuries.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.000]   If you look at that, if you look into the New Testament, it says Esau was evil for doing
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.160]   this.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.640]   But when you look at the actual story, I mean, how many of us would have thought, it's like,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.400]   yeah, I mean, because inheritance, a birthright, is not going to be, you don't know, it could
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.560]   be 50 years from now, 100 years from now, but I'm starving now.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:03.920]   We could relate to Esau, in fact, Jacob is the one, he's the weasel who's like, you know,
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.420]   maneuvering and lying and conniving to get the birthright.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:12.920]   But the reason why Jacob, even in his maneuvering, was considered righteous and Esau evil for
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.440]   what he did was because of the anointing upon this family.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.960]   See, this inheritance that was supposed to come to the firstborn was not just simply
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.280]   talking about wealth.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.200]   It was not about the cattle or the land.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.900]   What Esau was rejecting was the covenant promise that God made with this family.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.660]   So when he says, "What is my birthright when I'm hungry?"
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.600]   He's basically saying, "All the promises of God, what is it good to me when I'm hungry
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   now?"
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.120]   Israel was not like any other nation.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:55.560]   There was an anointing upon this nation that everybody knew, but God told them as they
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.840]   enter into the promised land, "If you keep my covenant and my commandments, God will
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   bless you.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.120]   But if you do not, there will be a curse upon you."
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.380]   So we know the history of Israel.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:10.200]   They go in, they begin to compromise, they chase after other gods, and as a result of
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.000]   that, punishment comes.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.680]   First the Assyrians come, they drag their best men and women, and they literally torture
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.000]   them.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   That wasn't enough.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.040]   The Babylonians come, and whatever was left of Israel, they take the other two tribes,
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.400]   and they take them into captivity.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:33.840]   There is a brief period of revival where King Cyrus, the Persian king, allows them to go
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.440]   back and reestablish the temple, reestablish the nation of Israel, but only a very small
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.040]   portion of Israel ever come back from Babylon.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.480]   And it was nothing like what they were hoping for.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.640]   Now if that wasn't enough, after that the Greeks come in and they conquer them, and
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.920]   after the Greeks, the Romans come in and conquer them.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:03.080]   During this whole period, in their frustration, in their dominance by secular nations, parents
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.720]   and grandparents kept on reminding each other.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:13.260]   No matter how hard it gets, every prophet in the Old Testament reminds them that though
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.720]   you are judged now, God will send a king, and when he comes, he's going to establish
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.200]   an everlasting kingdom.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.880]   There's going to be honey that's going to overflow from the ground, that the beast,
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.120]   the lions in the land, will be lying in the ground, and without any turmoil.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.720]   He's going to bring permanent peace.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   And so they reminded each other, no matter how hard the economy got, no matter how much
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:49.080]   they were suppressed, their hope was placed on this Messiah.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.880]   When he comes, everything is going to get better.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.440]   You have to understand that in the midst of all the hundreds and hundreds of years of
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:05.480]   frustration and hundreds and hundreds of years reminding each other from great, great, great
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:13.000]   grandparents telling them one generation after another, when the Messiah comes, God's going
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.640]   to restore what he promised to Abraham.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.320]   He's going to make our nation great.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.480]   So you can imagine the excitement about Jesus.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.600]   It wasn't simply about that period.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:32.600]   It was about the fulfillment of a nation that's been suppressed for generation after generation
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.400]   after generation.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:42.000]   Now Romans were not the cruelest of all the other secular nations.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.520]   The Assyrians were brutal.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.800]   They tore them apart.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.560]   They raped and pillaged villages to scare any other nation that would say, "If you mess
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.840]   with us, this is going to happen."
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.160]   The Romans weren't as cruel as the Greeks.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.800]   They forbade them from circumcision.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.600]   It was illegal to circumcise.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.760]   They set up an altar for their god at the temple that they were supposed to worship.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.760]   So they were cruel.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.920]   Romans, on the other hand, on the surface, looked like they were kind of allowing certain
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.020]   things to happen.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:18.920]   But you know, one of the things, I'm not going into too much detail about what it was like
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:24.240]   to be a Jew during the time of the Roman Empire, but remember in Matthew chapter 5, verse 41,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.760]   Jesus says, "If someone asks you to go a mile, instead of just going a mile, go the extra
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.760]   mile."
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.040]   And the reason why Jesus gives that reference was there was a law that said that if a Roman
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:42.080]   soldier saw you on the street and he asked you to carry his armor, his sword, whatever
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.160]   it was that he was carrying, you were required by law to carry that for him.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.880]   You can imagine how easily that can be abused.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.280]   A Roman soldier comes in and you're taking care of your children, and he says, "Take
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.000]   my stuff and walk a mile."
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   You have to.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.240]   It was by law.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.160]   Jesus was referring to that.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.160]   Instead of being angry over the situation, he says, "Go an extra mile.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.000]   Win him over by grace and kindness."
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   But again, it's easier said than done, but imagine if that happened on a Sabbath.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.320]   You're trying to keep the law, and you feel like you've kept the Sabbath well for so many
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:27.080]   years and all of a sudden a soldier comes on a Sabbath day and says, "You carry this."
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.760]   And so there was this tension between serving God and being obedient to Israel.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:39.080]   And if you look at all the questions that are asked of Jesus, it relates to that tension.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.740]   We're trying to obey God, but then Romans won't allow us.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.120]   How do we fulfill this?
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   We have this coin.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.480]   Who do we give it to?
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.560]   Do we give it to the temple?
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:54.120]   And so all the questions pertain to this tension.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.400]   It was miserable for the nation, especially if you were concerned about being obedient
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   to the Old Testament.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.800]   And that's why the Pharisees, you know, they all kind of figured out how to maneuver this.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.200]   See, it's in this context.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:16.440]   It says when Jesus came in, people were crying out, "Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest."
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.320]   And the word Hosanna literally means, "Save us.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.400]   Save us from this."
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.900]   And he's not simply talking about saving from the Romans.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.360]   This is generational.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:36.040]   Their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents told them every time,
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.440]   "The answer is the Messiah."
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:47.320]   When the Messiah comes, when the king is established, all of this is going to be wiped out.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:54.200]   God is going to fulfill what he says to Abraham in Genesis chapter 12.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.560]   But here's the strange thing.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   In the midst of this celebration, confetti, cloaks being thrown on the ground, this excitement
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:10.720]   of finally, finally God has heard our prayers.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.780]   Finally God is going to deliver us.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.440]   Finally he's going to save us.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.960]   And the ground is stirring because of excitement.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.600]   And then right in the middle of all that, in Luke chapter 1941, it says, "When he,"
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:28.800]   Jesus, "drew near and saw the city, he wept over it."
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.760]   Strange scene.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.480]   Everybody else celebrating, euphoria, excitement about what he's going to do.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.600]   They all were imagining what it was going to look like.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.640]   I mean, here's a man who could raise people from the dead.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.600]   What is he going to do to the Romans?
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   A countless number of times that the Jewish leaders wanted to catch him, and he just walks
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.480]   through the crowd, disappears.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.040]   Storm comes, and the disciples think that they're going to die.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.320]   He just wakes up and he says, "Calm down."
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.080]   And even the storm calms down.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.600]   What is he going to do to the Romans then?
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.880]   They came in to watch.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   They came in to participate.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.960]   They came in to celebrate.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:11.860]   If there was any period of Israel's history where they had hope, it was now.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:16.920]   And yet, the one that they placed their hope on in the middle of the celebration, this
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.080]   parade, it says, "He was weeping."
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.480]   There's only two places in the Bible where it says Jesus wept.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.760]   This is obviously the second one.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.840]   The first time is when Jesus was standing in front of Lazarus' tomb, and after he died,
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:40.340]   he saw the weeping of the people, which is also very strange because he went there late
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.340]   on purpose.
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.000]   He allowed time to pass so that he can die.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.220]   And he actually told them that he was going to raise him from the dead.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:53.600]   And yet, when he stood in front of Lazarus' grave, Jesus wept.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.380]   Why did he weep?
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.360]   This is the question that if we do not answer, don't know the answer to this question, you
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.920]   can worship Jesus all your life and completely miss the point.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.280]   If you were at a birthday party and everybody's singing "Happy Birthday," and the birthday
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:15.240]   boy is sitting there crying, it'd be weird for you to keep singing.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.160]   "Happy birthday to you," and then the guy is crying.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.160]   And it's like, well, maybe he's happy.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   Maybe that's what you think.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.880]   Maybe you'll just write it off as he's happy.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.440]   But clearly he's not happy.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.180]   He's not crying because he's happy.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.180]   Something is wrong.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:37.320]   Like, how many of us would just keep singing and then go cut the cake and smash it in his
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.960]   face and run around?
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.840]   It'd be weird.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.160]   An average person would stop and try to figure out what's going on.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.360]   Why are you crying?
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   What are we missing?
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   What happened?
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.240]   Did something happen before you came?
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:01.840]   You try to at least ask and find out because clearly there's something you don't understand.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:07.320]   But here, Jesus in the midst of this celebration, people going wild, throwing their clothes
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:15.280]   on the ground, and the Bible says that he was weeping, and yet nothing happens.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.960]   Nobody stops to ask him.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.680]   Nobody stops to ask the question like, "Jesus, what are we missing?"
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.880]   Maybe people must have seen him because it's recorded here, but my guess is they saw him
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.880]   weeping.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.080]   They didn't understand, so they just kind of kept going.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.680]   So they probably had that in the back of their mind, and they really didn't realize what
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.160]   was happening until after, later on, they looked back and said, "Yes, Jesus did weep,
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.040]   and he remembered everything that he said."
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.800]   Jesus says in verse 42 why he was weeping.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:56.000]   Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace, but now
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.560]   they are hidden from your eyes.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.120]   Scripture says that he was weeping because they completely missed why he came and who
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.160]   he was.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.760]   They thought they knew.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.120]   They thought they knew who he was.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.820]   They thought they knew why he came, and they were projecting all their hopes and dreams
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.520]   upon this Messiah.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.560]   But the reason why Jesus was weeping was the Messiah that they wanted was not the Messiah
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.920]   that was coming in.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.280]   And he knew that they would end up rejecting him when they found out that this was not
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   him.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.940]   They have been breaking the second commandment all along.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.560]   They made a graven image of God, and they were worshiping the false God all along in
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.420]   the name of Yahweh.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.840]   They were waiting and eagerly anticipating of the coming of the Messiah, but the Messiah
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:52.120]   that they projected was a Messiah that they've created in their own minds.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.600]   It was not the Messiah that was promised in Scripture.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.140]   And that's why they ended up rejecting him.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:08.080]   They wanted him to fulfill all their dreams.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:16.440]   How many of our Christian faith in our generation, in the name of Jesus, in the singing of the
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:22.120]   Gospels, in our membership in churches, is a pursuit of a God that we've created in our
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.180]   own mind?
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.380]   And the reason why it's so deceptive is because it seems close.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.740]   And that's what the danger of the second commandment is.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.840]   First commandment is very crystal clear.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.940]   Either you are with God or you are against God.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.320]   But the breaking of the second commandment, it happens when we are deceived.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:45.620]   We give in to our own passions, our own desire, our own passion, our own pride.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.720]   And we give in to it.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.140]   We call him Jesus.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.240]   We read the same Bible.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.780]   We pursue seemingly on the surface, sing the same songs.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.880]   Yet at the core, we make him into something that we want, rather than what the Scripture
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.000]   says.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.560]   You see, the Israelites constantly greeted each other by saying "shalom."
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.060]   And shalom basically means peace.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:17.100]   But the word for shalom, the Hebrew word, shalom, basically means completion.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.520]   And that's what they were looking for, a God to come and make them complete.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.280]   In fact, the Midrash, Midrash basically is a commentary of the first five books of the
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.280]   Old Testament.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.480]   The Jewish scholars basically was helping interpret the meaning of their laws.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.000]   And in the Midrash, this is how the law of God is summarized.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.760]   All that is written in the Torah was written for the sake of shalom.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.200]   Don't miss the significance of that.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.320]   Because he's not saying a part, he's not saying a certain part of the law.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.280]   He's saying all of the law.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:58.760]   In fact, the nation of Israel prided themselves of being the people of the law.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:06.360]   So when the scholars studying the Old Testament says, "All of the law was written for the
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.520]   sake of peace."
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.760]   That kind of gives you some context of why the Israelites were saying shalom to one another.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.240]   It wasn't just an average greeting.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.720]   It was all their hopes wrapped up in this word shalom.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.580]   That when Messiah comes, he's going to bring the shalom.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.520]   He's going to bring peace.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.560]   And again, the root word for peace, for the word shalom, is shalem, which means completion.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.800]   In other words, when he comes, he's going to bring perfection.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.940]   Whatever is lacking in our nation, whatever is lacking in our family, whatever is lacking
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:48.840]   in our education, whatever is lacking in our temple, in our worship, when he comes, he's
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.560]   going to bring the shalom.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.440]   And so they've been waiting for him to come.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:00.560]   You know what's interesting is, at the core of this word, peace and completion, is directly
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.700]   related to the word Sabbath.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:09.040]   In the Old Testament, in the book of Genesis, when God created and he worked for six days,
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.860]   what does he do on the seventh day when the work is complete?
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.840]   He enters into the Sabbath.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:20.920]   So the idea is work that leads to rest, completion.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.420]   So the idea of Sabbath is to bring us to completion.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.760]   And that's how the Bible describes our salvation, that because of what Jesus has done, because
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.600]   he finished his work, he takes us into his Sabbath.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.120]   That's why he says, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   what?
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.480]   Sabbath."
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.200]   That's why it says in the book of Hebrews later on, "Work hard to enter the what?
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.280]   The Sabbath, to rest."
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:53.640]   So in this word, shalom, contains the Old Testament version of all that we know of the
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.440]   gospel in the New Testament.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.640]   So the word shalom basically was a description of the Messiah who's going to come and fulfill
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.640]   this.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.960]   But the problem was, what they thought to be shalom was off.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.140]   And that's what Jesus is saying.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:17.280]   If they only knew what was going to bring peace, if they only knew what was truly going
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:22.080]   to bring peace, then judgment would not be coming.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.760]   After that, he describes the destruction of Israel in AD 70, that is fulfilled exactly
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.620]   like Jesus says.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.800]   And that's why he was weeping, even in the midst of celebration and this euphoria, because
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:40.040]   he knew that at the end of this, judgment was coming upon Israel, not deliverance.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:47.720]   The scripture describes, Isaiah 54 10, that the covenant he made with Israel was a covenant
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   of peace.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:54.400]   Judges 6 24, Jesus is called, God is called the Lord of peace.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.260]   First Thessalonians 5 23, God is called the God of peace.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.160]   The preaching of the gospel, according to Paul, is preaching of peace to those who are
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.480]   far and to those who are near.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:09.080]   Romans chapter 5 1 describes our salvation as having peace with God.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:15.800]   And Jesus ultimately is called the Prince of Peace in Isaiah 9 verse 6.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.120]   This Palm Sunday is a very, very important day for Christians.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:27.400]   It's not just the resurrection, because this day sets off the day that is going to either
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   lead us to the cross and celebrate the resurrection of Christ, or Palm Sunday is the day that
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.960]   people reject Christ.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:45.200]   Either the Jesus that we worship is the Jesus of the Bible, or it is a Jesus that we created
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   in our own mind.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.520]   It doesn't matter what he said.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.580]   It doesn't matter what he did.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:53.120]   It doesn't matter how we got to the cross, because in the end, it doesn't change what
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.200]   I want from Jesus.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.960]   You can live your whole life in church, calling his name Jesus, praying to Jesus, worshiping
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:09.160]   Jesus and have the same response of Christ weeping over our souls, because we did not
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.080]   understand what would bring peace.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.040]   Some followed him because he fed them.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.000]   Some followed him because he healed them.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.360]   Some followed him because he was powerful.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.760]   He was like a rock star.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.760]   Everywhere he went, there was a lot of activity.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.320]   Some followed him because they thought they were going to benefit from his fame.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.200]   But in the midst of following him, many missed him.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.560]   In John 1.10, it says, "He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.200]   world did not know him."
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:52.520]   I think the greatest tragedy of being in a Christianized nation is that that line between
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.400]   following the Christ of the Bible and the Christ that we've created has been blurred
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:05.000]   to the point where it's difficult for us to tell who is and is not following Jesus.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.440]   This Palm Sunday is for that purpose.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.640]   It's for us to examine ourselves.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.080]   Am I following Jesus, or am I following the Jesus I've created in my mind?
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.420]   Is this a cultural Christ or Christ of the Bible that I worship?
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:27.680]   Is this Christ that I worship, if I follow him, do I follow him to the cross, or do I
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.160]   follow him to glory?
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.400]   Acts chapter 13.27, "For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.720]   not recognize him, nor understand the utterance of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath,
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.880]   fulfilled them by condemning him."
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.480]   A few recognize why he came.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:57.720]   A few he anointed, and it is by the testimony of the few that we have the gospel here today.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.040]   But as it says in Acts 13.27, "Because they did not recognize him, they also fulfilled
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:10.280]   the prophecy by rejecting him, condemning him, and by their hands they crucified him."
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.840]   You and I will either be the recipients of what Christ has done on the cross, or we will
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:21.320]   participate in the sins of those who crucified him on that same cross.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:27.280]   In Isaiah 53, 4-6, it says, "Surely our grief he himself bore, and our sorrows he carried,
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.520]   yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.840]   But he was pierced through for our transgression, he was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.360]   The chastening for our well-being fell upon him, and by his scourging we are healed.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.740]   All of us like sheep have gone astray, each of us turned to his own way, but the Lord
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:51.120]   has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him."
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.840]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.440]   All the activities that we're doing this week, again, it's for the purpose of reminding us,
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.240]   helping us not to drift.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.520]   If you've already drifted, it'd be a great opportunity this week to kind of catch yourself
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.520]   and recalibrate your heart and your life to get right with God.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.120]   And those of you, maybe you're doing fine, but to strengthen what you already have so
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:17.680]   that it doesn't become weak and begin to stray.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:22.800]   But all of this, all of this that we're doing, everything that we do on Sunday, everything
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:29.360]   that we do this week is for the purpose of reminding us, this is not our home.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   Jesus did not die to make your business better.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.840]   Jesus did not die to feed you because you're hungry.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.960]   Jesus did not die so that you can have a better marriage.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.520]   Jesus did not die so that you can have a better career.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.120]   Jesus did not die so that you can have better friends.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.360]   Jesus did not die so that you can have a better retirement and you'd make wise choices in
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:03.080]   your investment so that you can get ahead in life with the help of Jesus.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.200]   That's not why Jesus died.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:11.520]   He didn't save us from having a hard life in this world.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.980]   He saved us so that we would not have a hard life in eternity.
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:23.320]   That even if our life during our period here is difficult, all of that to ultimately result
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:29.280]   in glory when He comes is not about this place.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.000]   I pray that our Lord would open our eyes to see that we're just sojourners just passing
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   through.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.240]   And the main thing that He saved us from is ourselves.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.480]   The greatest enemy is not outside of us.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.700]   It's our own sins.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.800]   It's our own sins.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.680]   It's our own pride.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.900]   It's our own lust.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.000]   It's our own coveting.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.480]   It's our own hatred and anger.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.600]   He came to save us from ourselves.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:09.280]   And until we recognize that, when we say, "Save us, O God!
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.200]   Save us, Hosanna!" we will be proclaiming the same thing that the multitudes did.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:20.400]   And Jesus will be weeping over our souls because we completely missed the point.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.360]   I pray that each event of this week would cause us to see the depth of our sin that
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.040]   required the depth of His sacrifice.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:38.640]   So that when we come into communion on Friday, that that communion table would break us.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:44.720]   The significance of what He has done on Friday would not simply just pass us by like any
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.160]   other day.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.600]   That we would weep with Him, that we may celebrate with Him.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:38:00.840]   Let's take some time to pray as we invite our worship team to come.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.960]   My prayer is that today would prepare us for what's coming.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.200]   I don't want you guys to think of it as like, "Okay, Sunday is over and then now what?"
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.600]   But the whole purpose of today's message is to get you ready for what's coming and to
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.320]   really set apart this week fast.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.040]   Put away certain things.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.040]   Whatever it is that you normally do, it may not be sinful, but to commit this week to
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.800]   really get right and get on the right track with God.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.280]   So let's pray and ask God to reveal those things.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   What should I do?
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:36.560]   What should I pursue in a tangible way?
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.560]   Amen.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.060]   (light music)
