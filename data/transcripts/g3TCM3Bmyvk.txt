[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.980]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.980]   Is Pastor Nate here somewhere?
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.980]   Okay, we have an announcement from our college department,
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.980]   so he's gonna come and give an announcement.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.980]   - Hello, my name is Nathan.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.980]   I'm the college pastor here.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.980]   We're going to be having a college fundraiser
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.980]   right after service today.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.980]   We're gonna be serving Chipotle-style bowls.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.980]   It's gonna be only $7,
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.980]   which is unheard of in this inflated day.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.980]   And so please come by.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.980]   We've been working all night.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.980]   We've been working really hard.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.980]   The students are cutting a bunch of pico de gallo
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.980]   and things like that in the kitchen.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   And so we would love to serve you
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.980]   as well as receive some donations.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.980]   So if you guys can, please feel free afterwards.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.980]   We're gonna be converting this courtyard
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.980]   into a quick dining area.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.980]   You can eat in the cafe and all those types of places.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.980]   And we also have a few sweaters and shirts
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:35.980]   if you'd like to purchase those
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.980]   that were left over from some of our retreats.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.980]   They're in very high demand, though,
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.980]   so if you want it, you gotta get in line early.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.980]   Thank you.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.980]   (audience applauding)
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.980]   - You probably noticed that the energy level
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.980]   was much higher than me.
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.980]   That's why he's our college pastor, all right?
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:56.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.980]   Our family ministry Christmas gathering,
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.980]   our brother Dean gave an announcement last week,
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.980]   but if you are interested or willing to serve that way,
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.980]   to open up your home, please contact our brother Dean.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.980]   And again, his email address is on the website
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.980]   or on the church app.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.980]   And then the holiday outreach,
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.980]   I think most of it is filled,
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.980]   but they have a few spots that are still open
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.980]   if you're interested.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.980]   And if you go out of the courtyard,
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.980]   there is a canopy that's set up,
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.980]   and that's where they're gonna be.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.980]   So if you go out there and visit the booth,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.980]   they'll be able to tell you what are still
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.980]   some open spots for you for that ministry
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.980]   for this Christmas,
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.980]   I can't get my words out,
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.980]   Christmas stuff that's coming out, okay?
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.980]   So you can just go visit that place,
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.980]   and then they'll give you instructions on that.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.980]   All right, so again, if you are visiting us
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.980]   and you're new to the church,
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.980]   our physical offering box is in the back.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.980]   And otherwise, I'll pray for us,
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.980]   and then we'll give you a minute
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.980]   to give your offering electronically.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.980]   All right, let's pray.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.980]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for continued love
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.980]   and grace that you pour upon us,
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.980]   things that we know,
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.980]   things, Lord God, that we may not even be aware of.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.980]   Help us, Lord, to lift up our eyes,
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.980]   to know, Father, where our true help comes from.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.980]   And as we've been admonished, encouraged,
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.980]   and exhorted, Lord God, to anchor in Christ,
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.980]   help us, Lord, not to drift,
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.980]   but allow your word to speak to us.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   And ask, Lord God, that even in our giving,
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.980]   that we would do it purposefully, joyfully,
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.980]   and that it may be multiplied for your use.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.980]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.980]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.980]   to Hebrews chapter 13, verses 9, verse 9.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.980]   I'm going to be reading from verse 7 to 9.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   Hebrews chapter 13, verses 7 to 9.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.980]   Again, those of you who are joining us,
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.980]   you weren't here with us as we were going through
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   the whole book of Hebrew.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.980]   Chapter 13, starting from verse 7,
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.980]   actually most of the chapter is really a summary
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.980]   of what he's been trying to say through the whole book.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.980]   And now he's making his conclusion as to application,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.980]   why he's been telling us not to drift,
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.980]   and why Christ was exalted, that he is better than
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.980]   all that they are tempted by.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.980]   And so now he's kind of like summarizing.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.980]   So every part of what he says here has a direct linkage
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.980]   to things that he's been saying through the other 12 chapters.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.980]   So that's why we want to make sure that we're thorough
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.980]   in our observation and our application
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.980]   as we go through this text.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.980]   So let's look at verse 7 through 9.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.980]   Again, our emphasis here today is in verse 9.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.980]   "Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you,
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.980]   and considering the result of their conduct,
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.980]   imitate their faith.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.980]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.980]   Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings,
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.980]   for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace,
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   not by foods, through which those who were so occupied
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.980]   were not benefited."
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.980]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your grace
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:09.980]   that we ourselves, Lord God, would be strengthened by grace,
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.980]   that we would not be carried away, Father God,
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.980]   or drift by every wind of doctrine
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.980]   that comes in our generation.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.980]   Help us, Lord God, to be grounded in you, in your word,
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.980]   that we would not turn from it to the left or to the right,
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   that we would not take away from it,
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.980]   nor to add to it,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.980]   and that we would not simply be hearers of the word,
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.980]   but also doers as well.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.980]   We lift these things to you, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.980]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.980]   Again, you don't have to audibly answer it,
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:48.980]   but just to get you to think before we start.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.980]   When you've talked to people--
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.980]   maybe you yourself had a view of this--
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.980]   when you talk to people about the church,
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.980]   what is the most common complaint
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.980]   that people have about the church?
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.980]   You don't have to yell it out.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.980]   What is the most common complaint that you've had?
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.980]   Maybe you're trying to share the gospel with a non-Christian
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.980]   and say, "Well, you Christians are like this.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.980]   I don't want to go to church because the church is like this."
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.980]   What is the most common complaint that you've heard?
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.980]   My guess is that if you were to categorize
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.980]   the majority of the complaints that you've heard
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.980]   of why they don't want to come to church,
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.980]   it probably falls into one or the other category.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.980]   One is that the church is filled with hypocrites.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.980]   You say one thing, and you act another way.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.980]   You're no different than the people in the world,
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.980]   or some might say, "I'm more moral
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   than a lot of the Christians that I know."
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.980]   And so you're a bunch of hypocrites.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.980]   So you'll either have that category,
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.980]   or the other category is that you guys are all
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.980]   just judgmental.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.980]   You guys are like, if you go there,
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.980]   everybody's looking down on each other,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.980]   and you guys are judgmental.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.980]   So I don't want to be a part of a community
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   that's always judging people.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.980]   Most likely, the complaints that you hear about the church
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.980]   will fall into one or the other category.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.980]   That complaint about the church is nothing new.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   It's not anything new to our generation.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   It's not a modern-day phenomenon.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.980]   If you look at the New Testament,
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.980]   the two primary problems that they were wrestling with
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.980]   in the early church falls into those two categories.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.980]   If you look at most of the New Testament,
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.980]   in every single letter, there is a wrestling
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.980]   with the Judaizers because they couldn't let go of the law.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:45.980]   So on top of the gospel, they added that you had to be a Jew,
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.980]   you had to be circumcised, you had to abide
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   by the rules of the Sabbath.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.980]   So you had to be a Jew in order to be a Christian.
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.980]   So we typically call them the Judaizers,
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:01.980]   or another word for it in our modern vocabulary is legalists.
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.980]   So in the early church, right off the bat,
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.980]   that was one of the main false doctrines
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.980]   that they were holding onto, and it led to legalism.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.980]   And then the other part of it came from the Gentile world.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.980]   There was a philosopher called the Gnostics,
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.980]   and the root teaching of the Gnostics was the flesh
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.980]   and the spirit is completely separate.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.980]   And so one of the things that they taught was
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.980]   Jesus could not have possibly come in the flesh
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.980]   because the flesh is evil and it's sinful.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.980]   So when we are saved, we are only saved in spirit,
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.980]   so what you do in the flesh doesn't really matter.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.980]   So when we die, spiritually we go to heaven,
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.980]   but the flesh will die and decay, so it doesn't matter.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.980]   So that came into the church through the Gnostic teaching
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.980]   through some people in the early church.
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.980]   So the whole letter of 1 John is dealing with that false teaching.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.980]   But it didn't stop with that in the first century.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.980]   They didn't teach this and then all of a sudden
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   weed it out of the church.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.980]   All throughout church history, you can examine
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.980]   teeter-tottering back and forth to legalism,
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.980]   to licentiousness, and in fact, I would say
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.980]   even in the short time that I've been a Christian,
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.980]   I became a Christian early in 1983,
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.980]   and it was at the tail end of the Jesus movement.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.980]   I didn't understand at that time what was going on,
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.980]   but at the tail end of the Jesus movement,
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.980]   some of you guys who either read about it
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.980]   or may remember that, it was a movement away from
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.980]   what they would consider legalism, this strict rule of
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.980]   you've got to do this, you've got to dress a certain way,
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.980]   because the hippie movement came across
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.980]   and they were having long hair, doing drugs,
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.980]   in order to reach those people, get rid of all of these rules
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.980]   and let the hippies just come in with their long hair,
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.980]   with, you know, they're not dressed properly,
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.980]   even without shoes, and Calvary Chapel was actually
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.980]   at the forefront of that movement.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.980]   And so I got saved at the tail end of that movement
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.980]   and the primary teaching during that period is
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.980]   Jesus loves you exactly the way you are.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.980]   Once saved, always saved. Christians are not perfect.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.980]   Just forgive it.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   But as that movement went on,
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.980]   obviously the licentiousness began to come in
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.980]   and people who kind of superficially professed their faith in Christ
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.980]   started to live lives that didn't match what the Scripture was saying.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.980]   And then in somewhere between the mid-80s to late-80s,
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.980]   there was the discipleship and holiness movement came in.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.980]   And so I remember at that time, early on in college,
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.980]   like everybody was being discipled by somebody.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.980]   The navigators and all these different ministries
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.980]   just began to pop up and you had to be disciplined,
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.980]   you had to do quiet time, and you had to memorize Scripture,
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.980]   and you had to share the Gospel.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.980]   And so you had these rules that you had to follow
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   in order to correct the mistake that some people fell into
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.980]   at the tail end of the Jesus movement.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   Well, as that movement started to grow,
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   there was a concern of legalism, spiritual abuse.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.980]   And so it became so rigid and people were coming to church
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.980]   and it was like, "We're not really encountering God."
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.980]   And so some of you guys may remember
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.980]   the charismatic movement started to come in
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.980]   the late '80s and the '90s, and they had a huge impact.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.980]   In fact, much of our modern worship today
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.980]   came in during that period because prior to that,
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.980]   it was considered contemporary if you used a guitar.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.980]   Some of you guys who are a little bit older may remember.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.980]   It was like pipe organs or piano at best,
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.980]   and if you did anything more than that, we kind of like,
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.980]   "Is this allowable in the church?"
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.980]   And then during the charismatic movement,
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.980]   because the emphasis was we have to encounter God,
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.980]   we have to feel something, and so they went from--
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.980]   they moved away from discipleship
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.980]   to encountering God through these movements.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.980]   So the songs and sometimes the preaching, the services
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.980]   were all to get you to feel God, to be touched by God.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.980]   So if you look at the songs that we were singing
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.980]   during that period, all of it was,
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.980]   "Come and touch me, come and fill me,"
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.980]   because that was the emphasis during that period.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.980]   And then along with that movement,
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.980]   people were concerned that a lot of the younger generation
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.980]   was starting to move out of the church,
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.980]   and so out of fear, there was a new movement
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.980]   that came in called the Seeker-Friendly Movement,
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.980]   and it was market-driven.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.980]   Because the churches are dying, and if we don't do something
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.980]   about it, the church is going to disappear,
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.980]   so they started using marketing techniques.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.980]   How do we get the most people to come?
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.980]   How can we get non-Christians to feel comfortable
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.980]   in order to grab their attention and reverse this decay,
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.980]   decline in the church?
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.980]   And the Seeker-Friendly Movement came in.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.980]   But at the end of the Seeker-Friendly Movement,
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.980]   people began to realize the superficialness
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.980]   because the Word of God is not being taught,
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.980]   sin is not being addressed, and it's just kind of like,
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:42.980]   "We want you to be here.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.980]   "Jesus loves you unconditionally."
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.980]   And so at the tail end of that, and I remember,
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:51.980]   I was doing ministry at that time, being so frustrated,
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.980]   but then I started to see a new movement coming in
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.980]   called the Young, Restless, and Reform Movement.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.980]   So some of you guys who are in your 30s and 40s
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   may remember that.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.980]   And all of a sudden, I started seeing 18-, 19-year-olds
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.980]   coming into ministry asking, "Do you believe in predestination?
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.980]   "Does your church practice church discipline?"
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.980]   And this is coming from 18-, 19-year-olds.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.980]   I couldn't get the 20-, 25-year-olds to be interested in church,
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.980]   and all of a sudden, the younger generation,
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.980]   and that generation now is in their late 30s and early 40s.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.980]   So I said, "Clearly, there's some kind of a movement going on."
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.980]   Because there was a heavy emphasis on Bible teaching
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.980]   and church discipline, and it started swinging back that way.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.980]   Then after a while, that movement started being more young
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.980]   and restless than reformed.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.980]   And then there was a movement toward, "We need to be gospel-centered,"
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.980]   because that's too legalistic, and so we need to be gospel-centered.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.980]   And all of a sudden, everything had to be gospel.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.980]   Everything is fighting against legalism--
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.980]   gospel-centered parenting, gospel-centered singing,
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.980]   gospel-centered preaching, gospel-centered missions,
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.980]   gospel-centered everything.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.980]   You go to the book store, everything is gospel-centered.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   At the tail end of that gospel-centered movement,
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.980]   they're realizing that there's a big hole in this movement,
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.980]   and so now we have the social justice movement, where it's like,
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.980]   "No, it's not just the gospel. We have to do something.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.980]   "We have to care, and you can't just preach the gospel.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.980]   "We have to alleviate the suffering."
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.980]   And so if you look at--even just during the short period
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.980]   that I've been a Christian, this teeter-tottering back and forth
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.980]   from legalism to materialism, from legalism to licentiousness,
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.980]   back and forth.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:34.980]   And when we try to correct, maybe when we've gone too far,
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.980]   we have a tendency, or our enemy has a tendency,
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   to play spiritual judo.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.980]   I remember when I was younger, I would wrestle with my friends,
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.980]   and I was pretty decent at wrestling because I grew up wrestling
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.980]   with my brothers.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.980]   And this was before Nintendo TV turned off at 11 o'clock,
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.980]   so either we threw rocks at each other, and then we wrestled.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.980]   So all of us were good at wrestling.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.980]   So I would wrestle my friends, and I would usually overpower them
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.980]   through wrestling, but I had this one guy,
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.980]   and he must have been no more than 120 pounds,
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.980]   and he would grab me and just flip me to the ground.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.980]   And I said, "Okay, that must have been a mistake."
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.980]   Every time I step in toward him, he would just grab me
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.980]   and then put his hip underneath my hip, and the next thing I know,
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.980]   I'm up in the air and I'm being slammed to the ground.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.980]   So I said, "What is going on?"
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.980]   And I found out he was a black belt in judo.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.980]   And then he was kind of telling me what he was doing.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.980]   He said every time he sees me moving toward him,
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.980]   he would use my own motion, and then he would use that against me.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.980]   So if I'm coming this direction, he would just kind of throw me
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.980]   off balance, and then he would flip me.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.980]   Now, the reason why I share that is because every time
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   that we try to balance ourselves, our enemy has a tendency
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   to use spiritual judo.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.980]   Our desire not to be legalistic ends up pushing us
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   toward licentiousness, and then our desire to say,
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   "You know what? We need to correct this," and then we end up
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   going back to legalism, going back and forth, back and forth.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.980]   The reason why I mention this is because in this text,
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.980]   in Hebrews chapter 39, it says, "Do not be carried away
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.980]   by varied and strange teaching."
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   The word "varied" here, it literally means to be multicolored,
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.980]   and "strange" is something alien.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.980]   And so these strange teachings that are coming in
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.980]   are taking something that may have some truth to it,
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.980]   and then it twists it, and then it kind of perverts it.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.980]   And that was the main problem in the early church,
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:43.980]   even to this day, desiring to make things right, to balance,
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.980]   and then our tendency is to kind of take it too far,
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:50.980]   and then we end up erring on one side or the other.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.980]   Now, it's in this where he is trying to tell them,
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.980]   "Do not be carried away."
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.980]   Drift.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.980]   And the word for "drift" here, again, as you guys know,
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.980]   this is nothing new in this text.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.980]   We're using that word all throughout the book of Hebrews
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.980]   not to neglect such a great salvation.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.980]   We don't anchor ourselves to other objects that are also going to move.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.980]   When we anchor ourselves, we have to anchor to something
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.980]   that when the waves come in, shifting back and forth,
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.980]   that whatever it is that we're anchored to isn't going to move.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:29.980]   That's why we're constantly told to anchor in Christ.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:35.980]   If you're anchored to friends, when they move, you will move.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.980]   If you're anchored to your family, when your family moves, you will move.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.980]   If you're anchored to your job, when your job disappears,
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.980]   you end up shifting with that.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.980]   We don't anchor ourselves to things that are not stable.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.980]   A boat does not anchor itself to another boat.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.980]   A boat anchors itself to something that's not going to move.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.980]   And that's why he says we need to be anchored in Christ.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.980]   Anything else that you anchor yourself to is just a matter of time
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.980]   that it's going to shift.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.980]   Ephesians 4, 11-14, it says,
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.980]   "He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists,
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.980]   and some as pastors and teachers."
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:20.980]   If you notice here, the positions of each one of these people,
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.980]   apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers,
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.980]   they're all teachers of the Bible.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.980]   They're all people whose primary duty was to proclaim the Word of God.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.980]   The context may be different for each title, but every single one of them.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.980]   He says the reason why he gave them that,
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.980]   to equip the saints for the work of service,
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.980]   to empower them for the work of service,
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   to the building up of the body of Christ,
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.980]   until we all attain the unity of the faith.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.980]   Unity doesn't come because we're surrounded by people our age.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:57.980]   Unity doesn't come because people around us have the similar color hair.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.980]   Unity doesn't come because we have people who like outdoors,
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.980]   and so I like being around people who are outdoors,
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.980]   or similar job, or similar economic status.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:13.980]   The beauty of the church is that though we are varied in all different walks of life,
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.980]   what unites us is what we're anchored to.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.980]   And so because we are called to anchor in Christ,
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.980]   the church is not where we anchor ourselves.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.980]   Church is a gathering of people who are anchored in Christ.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.980]   And that's why he says, "They teach the Word of God,
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.980]   to the unity of faith, knowledge of the Son of God,
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.980]   to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.980]   As a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here and there
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.980]   by waves carried about by every wind of doctrine,
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:46.980]   by the trickery of men, by craftiness and deceitful scheming."
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:52.980]   I mean, the devil is constantly using maybe our good intentions
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.980]   and judoing us to the ground, you know, from different movement.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.980]   There's a reason why these movements were popular,
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:02.980]   because in and of itself, there's some truth to that.
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:04.980]   They're trying to correct something that went wrong.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:11.980]   But in correcting, our natural tendency is to fall into the scheme.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.980]   So how do we do this if the devil, who is smarter than us, stronger than us,
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   more powerful than us, how do we stay put?
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.980]   How do we make sure that we do not get tossed back and forth?
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.980]   There's a reason why he says in Hebrews 13, 8, it says,
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.980]   "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.980]   He's the only one that does not shift.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.980]   He's the only one that does not change.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:38.980]   If you anchor yourself to anything else, it's just a matter of time.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.980]   Again, in 1 Peter 1, 24-25, "For all flesh is like grass,
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.980]   and all is glory like the flowers of grass.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.980]   The grass withers, and the flower falls off,
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.980]   but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.980]   And this is the word which was preached to you."
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:58.980]   So the question is, what are you anchored to?
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:00.980]   What exactly are you anchored to?
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:06.980]   He says, "Do not be tossed back and forth by various strange doctrines that come in."
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.980]   And he says, "It is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace."
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.980]   It is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:19.980]   So in order for us to be anchored, he says, "You need to be strengthened by grace."
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:24.980]   But that term, "strengthened by grace," sounds like an oxymoron, doesn't it?
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:32.980]   Because typically when we think of grace, we think of someone who is soft, gentle, malleable, flexible.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.980]   Strength means power, righteousness, holiness.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.980]   But he says, "It is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace."
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.980]   And he says the same thing to Timothy.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:47.980]   2 Timothy 2.1, "You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ you."
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.980]   Be strong in the grace.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:54.980]   Typically if we tell somebody to be strong, we'll say, "Suck it up.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.980]   You're stronger than they are.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.980]   You're smarter than they are.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.980]   You have more knowledge than they are.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.980]   You're older than they are.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.980]   You have more power.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.980]   You're more talented than they are."
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   Instead, he tells this timid pastor, young pastor, he said, "No, be strong in the grace.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.980]   Do not be timid."
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.980]   You know, on the surface, that sounds like an oxymoron.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.980]   It seems like a contradiction.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:22.980]   But in fact, the Bible is filled with oxymorons, right?
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:28.980]   Paradoxes that seem like a contradiction, but when you dig into it, it makes perfect sense.
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:35.980]   We see another one in Hebrews 4.11, it says, "Let us strive to enter the rest."
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.980]   Strive to enter the rest.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:42.980]   So when we hear the word strive, it means stop being lazy, right?
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:43.980]   Stop watching Netflix.
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:45.980]   Get off your butt.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:46.980]   Do your quiet time.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:47.980]   Get to work.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.980]   Let's strive.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   We need to be committed.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.980]   Pick up your cross and follow Christ.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:53.980]   Why?
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.980]   So that we can rest.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:59.980]   I'm already tired, right?
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.980]   By that command, strive to rest.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.980]   That's exactly what it says.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.980]   On the surface, it seems like a contradiction.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.980]   To be strengthened by grace.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:18.980]   Hebrews 4.16, remember, he says, "Have confidence to enter the throne."
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.980]   Throne is where the power is.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.980]   Throne is where our help is.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.980]   Throne is where our king rules.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.980]   King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.980]   There's nothing above him.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.980]   But what kind of throne is it?
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.980]   Throne of grace.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.980]   You would not equate the throne with grace.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.980]   You equate the throne with power, with authority, and might.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.980]   But he says, "Come to the throne of grace."
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:49.980]   In fact, our Lord's very title in the book of Zechariah, he says,
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:54.980]   "Our king is coming riding on a donkey, humbled."
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.980]   Who would put those two words together?
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.980]   In fact, if we want to accuse somebody of being arrogant, what do we normally say?
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:02.980]   What do you think?
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.980]   You're the king?
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.980]   Right?
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.980]   Because that's what we mean when we say, "Oh, you're a king?
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.980]   You're acting like the king.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.980]   You think you're the king?"
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:19.980]   You think when LeBron James tattooed the king that it was a humble statement?
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.980]   That he was trying to be humble and serve the world?
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.980]   No, when he says king, he means he's better.
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:27.980]   He's better than anybody else.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.980]   He's the king.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:34.980]   And yet, our Lord's title is a humble king.
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:38.980]   And that's why the Jews could not understand because they thought their Messiah, the king,
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.980]   was going to come and he was going to dominate.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.980]   Just like what that word means.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.980]   I mean, he's above any secular kingdom.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.980]   He created the universe.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.980]   All things are made by him, for him.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.980]   All things are sustained by him.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:54.980]   And yet, it says he's a humble king.
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:50:00.980]   So they could not comprehend that their Messiah was going to humble themselves.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:07.980]   In fact, remember when Jesus was coming, in order to glorify the Father, remember what he did?
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.980]   He said, "I'm going to go to what?
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.980]   To the cross."
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.980]   And as he goes to the cross, what does he say?
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:19.980]   "I go to glorify the Father, and the Father to glorify me."
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.980]   Think about where he was going.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:27.980]   The cross was deliberately created to humiliate and humble people.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.980]   As an example, that if you don't submit to us, this is what's going to happen to you.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.980]   So it was a place of torture.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:33.980]   It was a place of humiliation.
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.980]   It was a place of suffering.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:41.980]   And yet, Jesus says, "I'm going to that to glorify the Father."
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:42.980]   And I'm going to go to that.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.980]   He said, "Lord, it's time for you to glorify me."
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:47.980]   How could that be?
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:51:01.980]   How can the most humiliating way to end life be the avenue in which God says he's going to glorify himself?
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:09.980]   It seems like an oxymoron, but our whole faith rests upon this idea of the humble king,
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:17.980]   of the throne of grace, of glory and humiliation, of strength by grace.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:26.980]   We talked about this about a month ago, that our holy God never compromises his holiness or his grace.
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:34.980]   That the cross was the perfect union of his mercy and his righteousness without a single compromise.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:40.980]   And so when he says, not to stray back and forth to legalism, to licentiousness,
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.980]   but it's good for our heart to be strengthened by grace.
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:48.980]   So this morning, I want to talk about four areas in which grace strengthens us.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.980]   First service, I did not get past number two.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.980]   So most likely I would just get to number two.
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:52:01.980]   But I want you to know what the other three and four is, because I don't want you to leave with incomplete doctrine.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:11.980]   So number one is, it first strengthens us by emptying us of our pride.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:19.980]   Number two, grace strengthens us because it gives us absolute security of our salvation.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:26.980]   Number three, grace strengthens us because it equips us for every good work.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:33.980]   And number four, grace strengthens us because it gives us boldness to proclaim the gospel.
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.980]   Let me get to number one.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.980]   How does grace strengthen us?
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:43.980]   If this is at the core of God's glory, if this is what the cross teaches us,
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.980]   it first empties us of our pride.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:52.980]   Ephesians chapter 289 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, that not of yourselves,
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.980]   it is a gift of God, not as a result of work.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.980]   So, all of that, so for what purpose?
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.980]   So that no one may boast."
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.980]   Think about the worldly principle.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:08.980]   Everything that we do is so that we can have something to boast about.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:09.980]   Right?
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.980]   I mean, why are we competing in BBA today?
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:14.980]   Right?
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:18.980]   So the winners can take a picture and put it up and say, "We beat you."
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.980]   You know, we're just having fun.
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.980]   But rest of what we do outside, like why do you go to school?
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.980]   You get a better job.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.980]   Make better money.
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:27.980]   Why do you invest?
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.980]   So that we can have more money.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.980]   You know, why do you work out?
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.980]   So you can have a better body.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.980]   And all of it is to improve our lives.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:44.980]   But here it says, "This was given to you by grace so that nobody can stand and boast."
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:45.980]   It's the act of the opposite.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:53.980]   And if you think about it, the whole rebellion of mankind is summarized in this statement.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:54.980]   Boasting.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:58.980]   Satan wanted God's glory.
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.980]   So that he can also boast.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.980]   So that he can also be glorified.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:07.980]   Adam and Eve was tempted and disobeyed God because they wanted the same knowledge that he had.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.980]   Tower of Babel was built so that they can touch God's glory.
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:15.980]   So all of mankind is, "We want glory."
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.980]   I mean, it doesn't take much for us to be filled with pride.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:27.980]   You walk into a room and you can survey the room and say, "I'm taller than him.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.980]   I'm better looking than this guy."
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.980]   You may never say it because they're going to think you're vain.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.980]   But you think it.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.980]   What school did you go to?
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.980]   Where do you work?
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   What do you do for a living?
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:45.980]   And somewhere in the back of your mind you're calculating, "I make more money than you."
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:46.980]   You went to UCLA?
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:47.980]   Oh, okay, okay.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:48.980]   Good job.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:49.980]   I went to Berkeley.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.980]   Oh, you went to Berkeley?
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.980]   I went to Stanford.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:56.980]   Right?
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:04.980]   We're constantly measuring in the back of our mind, even though we're too smart to vocalize it with our words.
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:07.980]   But it doesn't take much for us to become proud.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:10.980]   "I did quite --" Did you do quite that?
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:11.980]   Did you do this?
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.980]   How many people did you disciple?
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.980]   Even in the church, it doesn't take much for us to become proud.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.980]   You're a little bit more articulate.
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:21.980]   You read a little bit more.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.980]   You pray a little bit.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:28.980]   I've seen people come to morning prayer every day and then get in a fight afterwards.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.980]   It was like as a young Christian, it just blew my mind.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:36.980]   It's like, "Man, we spent an hour and a half praying together, and they're arguing outside in the parking lot."
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.980]   You know?
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:38.980]   I said, "What happened?"
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:41.980]   Even in our prayers, we measure.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.980]   I come out every day.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.980]   You only come Tuesday?
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:45.980]   You know?
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:51.980]   He says, "We're saved by grace so that no one will boast."
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:58.980]   In 1 Corinthians 1, 26 through 29, "But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.980]   God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:08.980]   And the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not,
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.980]   so that he may nullify the things that are for what purpose?
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:17.980]   So that no man may boast before God."
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:25.980]   The reason why he's saying this in Corinthians is because the church was infighting for who is more righteous.
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.980]   "Well, I follow Peter.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:33.980]   He's the first apostle, so clearly if you follow Peter, you must be more righteous than the others."
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.980]   No, I follow Paul because Paul, look what he did.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.980]   Look at how many churches that he planted.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.980]   I mean, this guy was a Roman citizen.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:42.980]   He gave up everything.
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:44.980]   So I follow apostle Paul.
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:49.980]   And some were saying, "Apollos is clearly the most gifted."
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:55.980]   I mean, he understood the Messiah that was going to come through the Old Testament even before it was explained to him.
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.980]   So he clearly understands the Old Testament better than the other apostles.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.980]   So I follow Apollos.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.980]   And then some were above all of that.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:07.980]   Since they can't compete with those three, it's like, "I follow Jesus."
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.980]   And they weren't saying this to be humble.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:13.980]   They were saying this to outdo the other people.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.980]   "Oh, you're Apollos?
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:17.980]   Oh, Peter?"
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.980]   "My master is Jesus."
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.980]   And because of this infighting and one-upping each other, who's more righteous than the other,
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.980]   it was causing all kind of chaos in the church.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:32.980]   And Paul writes to them and saying, "You foolish dummies," in the modern English.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.980]   Right?
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:38.980]   "Don't you know that he chose you because you were foolish?
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   Because you had nothing to offer?
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:48.980]   So that when people looked at you and they said, 'What is it about these fools that give them such power?
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:57.980]   What is it about these uneducated people, these mere fishermen, these poor people who had nothing to give?
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:02.980]   What is it about them that they're flipping the world upside down so that when people see this,
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.980]   they're not going to give them the credit?'
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:12.980]   That God chose the foolish things, the dumb found the wise, so that man will not boast."
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.980]   So human boasting doesn't fit the gospel.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.980]   I don't care how much we know.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.980]   I don't care how much we've experienced.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.980]   I don't care how disciplined we are.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:25.980]   Boasting and Christianity does not go together.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:31.980]   He says from the get-go, "God saved us so that no one may boast."
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.980]   Because boasting is at the core of our rebellion.
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:39.980]   Boasting is at the core of our coveting.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:45.980]   Because we're constantly measuring each other, measuring ourselves to see who's ahead.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:50.980]   And so he said, "You guys are all nullified."
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:58.980]   In order for us to be able to see the light of Christ brighter, our lights have to be turned dim or off.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.980]   So when we want to see the star, you don't go to the city.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.980]   If you want to see a brighter picture of the stars, you don't go to the city.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.980]   You go to the desert or you go to the mountain where there's less light.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.980]   And then even when you get there, what do you have to do?
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.980]   Turn off your light.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:15.980]   Whatever light is on, you've got to turn off.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.980]   Turn off your flashlight, turn off your car, turn off your lamp.
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:20.980]   And then you gaze up.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:25.980]   And then because all the other lights are dimmed, you're able to see the glory.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:30.980]   What prevents sinners from seeing the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.980]   Their own boasting.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:41.980]   Their own lights that they're trying so hard to make it brighter is blinding them to see the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:45.980]   So the first thing that he does, he says, "So that no one can boast, so that you can turn it off."
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:47.980]   And isn't that what justification is?
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:52.980]   When we recognize our own sins, we empty ourselves.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.980]   And I have nothing, so our lights are turned off.
[00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:03.980]   Whatever it is that we had to boast, all gets emptied out so that we can be filled with Christ.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.980]   That's the beginning of our salvation.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.980]   Remember Apostle Paul in Corinth.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:16.980]   He comes in tired, beaten, in jail, discouraged.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.980]   It doesn't say he wanted to quit, but I mean, you could tell he's a human being too.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:26.980]   He's being beaten, stoned, jailed, whipped, shipwrecked.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:32.980]   And Jesus has to actually talk to him and say, "Hey, I have more of my people here, so you persevere."
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:42.980]   So he risked his life, his well-being, fatigue, all of that to bring the gospel to the Corinth.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:49.980]   But because they didn't like what he had to say, they started to question his authority.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.980]   He's an apostle?
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.980]   But they didn't stop there.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.980]   They started questioning his motive.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.980]   They said, "That guy's like any other false prophet coming into town.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.980]   He's doing it for money."
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.980]   And then they started questioning his ability.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.980]   He speaks well, but his appearance is not impressive.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   They even made fun of the way he looked.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.980]   At least that's how it's interpreted, right?
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:20.980]   I mean, he literally gave everything so that they may have the gospel,
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.980]   and they were questioning everything about him.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:28.980]   And so, Apostle Paul says he pleaded with the Lord to take this thorn on his side out.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:35.980]   Most commentators believe that the thorn he's referring to were his detractors,
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:36.980]   people who were questioning him.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:41.980]   Remember, when he was in Philippi sitting in prison, he said some preached Christ out of envy
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:42.980]   to put more pressure on him.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   Can you believe that?
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.980]   Inside the church, people are preaching the gospel just to make it harder for him.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:51.980]   He says, "Praise God, whether they do it out of poor motive or good motive,
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.980]   the gospel is preached."
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:59.980]   But this was so agonizing to him, he pleaded with the Lord, he says, three times.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:04.980]   And you know when the Bible says three times, it's not necessarily referring to one, two, three.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:08.980]   You know, the number three represents confirmation.
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:14.980]   You know, like it says, you know, for an elder, if there's two or three have something against him,
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.980]   they take it to the church, right?
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:22.980]   A church our size, there's got to be more than two or three people who have something against me.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:29.980]   So, even though the number three is mentioned, basically the spirit behind that is,
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.980]   it bothers him so much, he agonized before God, and my guess is he prayed every day,
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.980]   not just three times.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.980]   Like Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, "I prayed three times and God said no."
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.980]   This was agonizing for him.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:47.980]   "Lord, take this away. I'm doing so much for you, so much revelation is coming through him."
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:51.980]   In fact, when he asked, the way Jesus answered him was,
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:59.980]   "So much revelation is coming through this man, that there was concern that he may become proud."
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:03.980]   And so the way he answers him in 2 Corinthians 12, 9-10, and he said to me,
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:11.980]   "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness."
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.980]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to change your circumstance."
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.980]   And he's not saying that you don't have grace.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:23.980]   "I'm going to give you some more grace so that you can overcome this."
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.980]   He says, "What you have is enough."
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.980]   What you have is enough.
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.980]   Everything that you need for life of godliness has been given to you in the knowledge of his son Jesus Christ.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.980]   He says, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.980]   Everything you need, you already have.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.980]   I listen to that and it's another way of saying, "Suck it up."
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.980]   Not suck it up as in like, just bare-grin and just use your strength.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.980]   He says, "Look at my grace for you."
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.980]   Even in the midst of all of that.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:02.980]   He says, "Most gladly therefore I will rather boast about my weakness so that the power of Christ may dwell in me."
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:08.980]   He said his primary concern with Apostle Paul is that because God is doing such great work,
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:13.980]   that there was concern that his pride was going to get in the way.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.980]   That his experience, that he himself as a man is going to get in the way.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.980]   So he was deliberately weakening Apostle Paul.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.980]   Deliberately weakening him.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:31.980]   "Therefore I am well content with weakness, with insults, with distress, with persecution, with difficulty.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.980]   For Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong."
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:41.980]   In order for grace to be powerful, Paul needed to get out of the way.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:46.980]   It is when we are weak, he is strong.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.980]   So when he says, "Be strengthened by grace."
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:56.980]   Basically the first and the most prominent thing that we need to remember is to kill our pride.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.980]   That there is this desire to be recognized.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.980]   This desire to one up on somebody.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:08.980]   To measure our righteousness against someone else's righteousness.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.980]   That we need to be humble before God.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.980]   And this is not just justification.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.980]   We are going to be talking about sanctification next week.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:20.980]   I meant to talk about it today, but we ran out of time.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.980]   It is not just talking about justification.
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:29.980]   Our sanctification is also so that you and I do not boast.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.980]   He reminds us who we are and to be strengthened by grace.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:42.980]   And in order for us to be strengthened by grace, we need to first recognize whatever strength that you think you have must be humbled.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:51.980]   It is in the areas where you and I think are strong are the areas where we stumble the most.
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:06:01.980]   If you are good with numbers and you are accounting, you know, or if you have gotten promotion at a job somewhere and you happen to be a manager,
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.980]   that is where your pride is the greatest.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.980]   That is where you have the most opinion.
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:13.980]   That is where you think you can do the most for the kingdom of God.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:24.980]   And so remember when Peter, you know, and the apostles, like they were fishing and they came back after fishing all night and they didn't catch anything.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:30.980]   And here is this carpenter, Jesus, and he said, hey, throw out your net.
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:34.980]   And you could tell the frustration of these fishermen.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:35.980]   We fished all night.
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.980]   We couldn't catch anything.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:42.980]   I know you are the Lord, but I am a fisherman.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:49.980]   And these professional fishermen fished all night and we couldn't catch anything.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.980]   But they have learned a lesson by then, right?
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.980]   Jesus was resurrected and he said, hey, man, I screwed up before.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:56.980]   Maybe I shouldn't screw up again.
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:01.980]   He said, because you said it, I will do it.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:08.980]   So they humbled themselves because they learned their lesson and threw their net in and they brought so much that they couldn't even count.
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:12.980]   And simply because they obeyed the carpenter.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.980]   It is in the areas that we are proud of.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.980]   It is in the areas that we think we are strong.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.980]   That is where we stumble the greatest.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.980]   That is where we have the greatest problem.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:30.980]   And that is why to be strengthened by grace, we need to first and foremost be humbled.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:34.980]   Because we don't need to pray if we are good.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:40.980]   We are not desperate when we can take care of ourselves.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:41.980]   We are not in need.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:46.980]   We want, I want Jesus, but I don't need Jesus because I am capable.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:53.980]   For wherever where we have pride is the area that you are most likely the weakest.
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:08:00.980]   So we are saved by grace and grace so that we cannot boast.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:06.980]   Secondly, we are strengthened by grace because we have absolute security in our salvation.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:11.980]   Hebrews 13, 5, I will never desert you nor will I ever forsake you.
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:15.980]   Remember, we talked about how there is five negatives here.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.980]   Never, ever, ever, never, never.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.980]   Was that four or five?
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.980]   Never, five times.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:29.980]   Just in case you didn't understand the first time, I will never forsake you.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:32.980]   Never, really never?
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:33.980]   Never, never.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:40.980]   Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:44.980]   Do you actually know what I have done?
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.980]   Do you know how much I struggle?
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.980]   Never, never, never.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:54.980]   Never, ever, ever, never, never.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.980]   Never.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.980]   There is a reason why he says that.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.980]   He knows.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:06.980]   He knows our tendency to be proud when we think we are doing good.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.980]   And he knows how destructive we get when we are struggling, that I am not worthy.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:13.980]   That somehow I need to earn my salvation.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:21.980]   Even though we don't say that, that we become easily proud when we feel like we are more disciplined.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:25.980]   And then we are like, we are unworthy of his grace when we are not doing well.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:29.980]   You understand the meaning of grace?
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:32.980]   It means you got something you didn't deserve.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.980]   That's the very definition of grace.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:40.980]   If you earned grace, you didn't get grace.
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:48.980]   And so to be strengthened by grace means that our salvation is secure in him.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.980]   Isaiah 41, 10 says, "Do not fear, for I am with you.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:53.980]   Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.980]   I will strengthen you.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:56.980]   Surely I will help you.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.980]   Surely I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.980]   You notice here how many times he says, "I am with you.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.980]   Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God.
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:05.980]   I will strengthen you.
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:06.980]   Surely I will help you.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:10.980]   Surely I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:19.980]   Our salvation, our relationship with God is dependent upon his covenant, his promise, his faithfulness, his immutability.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:25.980]   And so when Jesus told his disciples, "How many times should I forgive my brother?"
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.980]   Seven times.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:33.980]   Peter said seven times because he was waiting for the eighth time.
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:38.980]   He said, "Well, three times, okay, that's what we're told to do.
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.980]   But since we're disciples of Jesus, seven times."
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:41.980]   Right?
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:42.980]   Seven times.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:46.980]   In the back of his mind, he's probably thinking like on the eighth time he's going to get it.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:52.980]   With Jesus' approval, but Jesus says seven times seventy.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:57.980]   I could imagine the disciples calculating with their fingers and toes.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.980]   Right?
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.980]   Wait a second.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.980]   I'm going to lose track.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.980]   But you know what he meant.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:09.980]   As long as he is repentant, forgive him.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:13.980]   Think about that humanly speaking.
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:20.980]   I mean, what he's telling his disciples to do is not human, is not natural.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:26.980]   Remember if somebody fools you once, right?
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:27.980]   How does that go?
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:32.980]   Somebody fooled you once, shame on you.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:33.980]   Shame on me.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.980]   Okay, thank you.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:35.980]   All right?
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.980]   Thanks, Lee.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.980]   Somebody fooled you once, shame on me.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.980]   No, shame on you.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.980]   What's going on here?
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.980]   All right?
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:47.980]   I need to anchor in Christ.
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.980]   Somebody fooled you once, shame on you.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.980]   If somebody fools me twice, shame on me.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.980]   What do we mean by that?
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.980]   Don't leave yourself vulnerable.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:04.980]   If they do that to you again, that's your fault for being fools and putting yourself in that situation.
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.980]   You should have learned, right, and put them in their place the second time.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:09.980]   That's what that means, right?
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.980]   That's worldly wisdom.
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:12.980]   Seven times.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:19.980]   So seven times, even seven times doesn't seem natural, right?
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:25.980]   Fool me once, then fool me two, three, four, five, six, seven times?
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.980]   He says, "No, seven times, seven."
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:28.980]   What does he mean by that?
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:33.980]   As long as their repentance is genuine, forgive them.
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.980]   That's not worldly wisdom.
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.980]   That's godly grace.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:44.980]   And the only way that he can do that is because our God is immutable.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:53.980]   The same God who forgave us the first time we repented is the same God that we will meet 400th time
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   because he is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.980]   His immutability is based upon all knowledge.
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:12.980]   So when we come to him the 400th time, as long as our repentance is genuine, he says he will forgive us.
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:16.980]   That's how secure our salvation is.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.980]   Does that give you strength?
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.980]   Absolutely.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:26.980]   You know, I used to think when I was a younger Christian because this illustration was given to me
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:33.980]   that God's grace means that he bridged the gap for us and he threw down a rope.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:37.980]   And so sanctification is me climbing this rope.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.980]   Because that's what I was told and that's what I believe.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:46.980]   This is again at the tail end of the Jesus movement and people were starting to correct it back into holiness.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.980]   And no, you've got to climb this.
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:53.980]   And that made so much sense to me because I was seeing so much licentiousness in the church.
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:54.980]   And I was like, that makes sense.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.980]   That's why people are living the way that they are because they're not climbing.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.980]   They need to climb.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.980]   So I started climbing.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:08.980]   But the problem with that analogy, one, it's not biblical.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:13.980]   But two, I could never climb this rope.
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:23.980]   I would go up, you know, 10 feet and slide down 11, determined to go up another 10 feet and slide down 12.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:29.980]   And after a year, year and a half of this, not making any progress.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.980]   I said, man, what's wrong with me?
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:36.980]   And I just got so sick and tired of failing and sliding and going up and sliding.
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:39.980]   And I just, I can't do this anymore.
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:45.980]   It took years for me to realize how unbiblical that analogy was.
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:49.980]   Christ didn't just throw down a rope from heaven.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.980]   He said he walked in our shoes.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:55.980]   He came down.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:05.980]   He wrapped us up, held us in his righteous right hand, and he will make sure that we will be glorified.
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:10.980]   And so having this assurance of salvation frees me to live my life.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:17.980]   That's what Paul means when he says, I know how to be content in every and all situations, whether you have a lot or a little,
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.980]   because he's not anchored in money.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.980]   He's not anchored in safety.
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.980]   He's anchored in Christ.
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:27.980]   So let me finish with this analogy.
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:33.980]   I know we have BBA finals, right, highlight of some of our year, right, some of us.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:40.980]   I'm praying for the BBA legends because some of the older members of our church are still in it.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   And so I'm praying that they don't get hurt, that they will, somebody's going to win, right.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.980]   And then some of you guys who are playing BBA, I mean, it's fun.
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.980]   We're going to come and watch you guys to see, right.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.980]   But imagine this game, this gift that we've been given because we're young.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.980]   We have friends that we can play with, and we have a nice court to play and fellowship with other Christians.
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:08.980]   Imagine if I said, if you don't win, you can't come to church anymore.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:13.980]   It's no longer a game to enjoy, right.
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:18.980]   It's something that's going to cause fear and anxiety.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:26.980]   And this very gift that we're enjoying turns into a burden that will crush us.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:33.980]   It's being strengthened by grace to humble ourselves and recognize that our salvation is secure in Christ.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:42.980]   That whether we win or lose, whether we have a lot or little, whether we are successful in the eyes of the world or not,
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:47.980]   it doesn't change anything because my eternity in Christ is secure.
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.980]   Because my life is now hidden in Christ.
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.980]   When Christ come in his glory, we will be glorified with him.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:57.980]   We will know what real life is like when he comes.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:05.980]   So whether I win or lose, I can enjoy what I have here as a blessing of God, little or a lot.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.980]   This is why grace strengthens us.
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:16.980]   And either self-righteousness or licentiousness will crush us.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:25.980]   So again, I'll get to the number three and four next week, but three is just as important because I don't want anybody here ending saying,
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.980]   "Let us sin so grace may abound then."
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:33.980]   Right. Paul says, "No! By no means."
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:38.980]   Grace does not mean that therefore what we do in life doesn't matter.
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.980]   Right. But that's next week.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.980]   I just don't want you to have heresy in your head before we get into our break.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.980]   But we'll talk about that next week.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:51.980]   Let's pray.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:18:03.980]   Gracious Father, we thank you for loving us and saving us, adopting us, Lord God, that we may call you our Abba Father.
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:12.980]   Help us, Lord, that we would not drift from every wind of doctrine that comes in from generation to generation.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:23.980]   Help us to be anchored in Christ and the Christ of the Word, that we would not be driven back and forth.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:29.980]   But I pray, Lord God, that your Word that you've implanted in our hearts, that we would be strengthened by this grace,
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:32.980]   that we may live lives worthy of the gospel that you've given.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:39.980]   May Christ be exalted, your name honored, and the world know, Father God, that there is hope in the name of Jesus.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:48.980]   Praise.

[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.980]   Let's pray.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:40.980]   1 Corinthians 1, 18 and 19 says, "For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.980]   but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:50.980]   For it is written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the cleverness of the clever I will set aside.'"
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:59.980]   Lord, we pray that your word will be the foundation upon everything that we pursue.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:05.980]   Help us, Lord God, not to be short-sighted, knowing that our life is temporary here.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.980]   Help us, Lord God, to live a life truly worthy of the calling that you've been given to us.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:15.980]   I pray that you would help us not to stray from your word to the left or to the right,
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.980]   but that your grace would strengthen us, empower us,
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:26.980]   empty us of our own pride, empty us, Lord God, of our self-sufficiency,
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:34.980]   that we would remain in you, knowing, Father God, that you are the only anchor that is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:38.980]   May Christ's name and his glory be glorified wherever you send us this week.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:51.980]   [Music]
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:24:01.980]   He came to earth, healed and full of love.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:11.980]   He worked and died to buy my power.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:21.980]   My help and help is there to save your days.
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:31.980]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:41.980]   Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:51.980]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:25:03.980]   And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.980]   Amen.
