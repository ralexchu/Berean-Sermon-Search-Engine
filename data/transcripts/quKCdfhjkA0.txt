[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.140]   that we're able to come together and worship.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.140]   If you guys been watching the news
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.860]   and just probably driving around,
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.640]   you see more and more people just moving about.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.380]   The weather's getting hotter
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.700]   and the ice seems to be slowly thawing.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.580]   And so we're hoping that within the next week or two
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.060]   that we'll get some information
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.220]   as to how we can begin to slowly open up the church.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.640]   Again, we'll keep you updated as much as we can
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.260]   so that you'll have a heads up on what's going on.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.900]   So let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:05.580]   Tomorrow at 8.30 p.m.,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.180]   we're gonna be having a baptism info session and Q&A.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.420]   It is not going to be a full-blown teaching on baptism
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.300]   because the main purpose of this meeting
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.080]   is to answer some questions about how we practice,
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.420]   what we're practicing,
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.380]   and some of the questions that may have come up,
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.120]   again, of how we are practicing baptism at church
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.820]   and what we are requiring for the members.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.380]   So please link into that at 8.30.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.900]   We're gonna start 8.30 sharp,
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.840]   so please just join that maybe a minute or two before.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.780]   This coming Saturday,
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.820]   our sisters are hosting a praise and prayer night
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.920]   at 8.30 p.m.,
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.400]   and they're asking that you would register
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.540]   no later than May 6th.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.020]   So you can go online.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.780]   There will be a link on, again, our Facebook page,
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.300]   our website, so go there
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.820]   and just let them know that you're coming.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.580]   And again, the link to that will be given,
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.420]   and you can just come in a little bit early,
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.460]   and it'll start at 8.30.
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.780]   Again, to update you,
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.160]   and I know we just had a members update meeting,
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.640]   but on May 17th at 3 p.m.,
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.080]   by then, we're hoping that we'll have more information
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.280]   to give you and how our church is going to handle
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.380]   the slow opening up of the church,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.340]   and so we'll be able to give you updated information
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.180]   at that time.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.080]   So just mark that on your calendar on May 17th at 3 p.m.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.720]   We're asking all the members to come,
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.920]   and we'll give you, hopefully by then,
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.960]   some more detailed information
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.600]   about how we're gonna be utilizing the church facility
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.260]   and ministry at church, okay?
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.860]   Well, this morning, before we get started,
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.700]   we have some good boys and girls,
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.340]   and especially we have Maddie, who was really good,
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.500]   and I got a pink lollipop waiting for you.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.340]   Great job.
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.280]   Olivia, heard that you guys did a great job,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.960]   and Arthur as well.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.380]   Okay, keep up the good work.
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.980]   Harvey Kim, thank you for being a good boy last week.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.980]   And then the Lee brothers and sister, Noel, great job.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.540]   Trevor said you were doing a great job,
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.920]   and Carter, please continue to do a great job
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.860]   in worshiping the Lord with your family together.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.540]   We have a few birthdays as well.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.180]   Killian is turning four this week.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.540]   Happy birthday.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.500]   Owen Kim is turning two.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.500]   Adam Wong is turning two.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.980]   And then Corbin John, the big boy,
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.380]   the middle child, finally is getting some recognition.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.440]   He's turning 10 this week.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.020]   Happy birthday.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.940]   Okay, let's pray, and then we'll have time of offering
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.460]   before we get into our main pray set.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.300]   Let's pray.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:42.200]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for sustaining us.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.220]   We thank you for anchoring our lives
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.540]   and our thoughts on Christ,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.780]   especially now, Lord God, when things seem uncertain.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.220]   In our hearts are, some of us,
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.540]   many around the world, Lord,
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.980]   are troubled of what situation we are in
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.000]   and what may come.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.860]   I pray, Father God, that this would be an opportunity
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.760]   to shine your light in this world,
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.300]   that the hope that we have in Christ
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.920]   isn't just wishful thinking,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.280]   but that we serve a resurrected Christ
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.400]   that gives life and gives life abundantly.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.140]   We pray that this worship would be a reminder to us,
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.780]   that our mind would be renewed,
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.160]   that we would not be simply waiting, Father God,
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.220]   for the next stage in life,
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.780]   but that our hope, our thoughts, our eyes,
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.500]   we fully commit it to Christ and Christ alone.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.900]   I pray that the offering that we give
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.820]   may be multiplied for your use.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.420]   - All right, good morning.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.860]   We're continuing our series
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.740]   on the Jesus's seven I am statements in the gospel of John.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:24.260]   We're on his sixth one found in John chapter 14, verse six.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.860]   But I wanna read the context around this text.
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.860]   So I'm gonna start reading from John chapter 13, verse 33,
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.160]   and then John chapter 14 up to verse six, okay?
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.420]   Starting from verse 33.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.300]   Little children, I am with you a little while longer.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.700]   You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews,
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.700]   now I also say to you,
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.340]   where I am going, you cannot come.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.660]   Verse 36.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.300]   Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going?
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.900]   Jesus answered, where I go, you cannot follow me.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.580]   Follow me now, but you will follow later.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.060]   Peter said to him, Lord, why can I not follow you right now?
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.580]   Chapter 14, verse one.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.980]   Do not let your heart be troubled.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.460]   Believe in God, believe also in me.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.620]   In my Father's house are many dwelling places.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.280]   If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.620]   For I go to prepare a place for you.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.140]   If I go and prepare a place for you,
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.140]   I will come again and receive you to myself,
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.980]   that where I am, there you may be also.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.900]   And you know the way where I am going.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.500]   Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you are going.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.340]   How do we know the way?
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.100]   And in response to that, Jesus says,
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.200]   I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.860]   No one comes to the Father but through me.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.260]   Let's pray and then we'll jump into the message.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:45.060]   Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.940]   wanting to hear your voice.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.860]   We pray, Father God, that you would give us
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.800]   eagerness to listen, a mind that is open,
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.780]   to hear your voice in a will that is willing to surrender.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.380]   I pray that you would ordain this time
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.020]   for the purpose of glorifying your Son
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.540]   and sanctifying your church.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.300]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.900]   (footsteps)
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.260]   - All right, so at the end, I forget whether it's six weeks
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.580]   or seven weeks that we've been in quarantine.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.500]   And to be honest, sometimes I wake up
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.420]   and I don't know if it's Monday or Saturday,
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.740]   and the only way that I gauge what day it is
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.160]   because of the sermons coming up.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.560]   And so when I have to put on my suit,
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.640]   then I know it's Sunday, you know.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.140]   So I don't know what it's like.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.800]   I know many of you guys are still going to work,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.060]   but you know, I think, you know, I ask my kids,
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.780]   you know, what is the first thing that you wanna do
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.900]   once quarantine lifts?
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.060]   And obviously, you know, they wanna get together
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.060]   with their friends, maybe go out to eat,
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.860]   maybe hang out, you know, whatever that may be.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.140]   And I thought, you know,
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.500]   once this thing completely opens up,
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.760]   obviously the first thing that I look forward to
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.980]   is to see the whole church back at church, you know,
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.240]   to be able to have worship together, to sing together.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.060]   Maybe go to a nice restaurant and actually sit down
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.900]   and eat a meal, you know, instead of just taking it out
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.000]   or just eating at home.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.540]   Some of you guys have mentioned that your first thing
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.500]   that you wanna do is to run to Disneyland.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.580]   I don't understand you, but I know some of you guys
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.820]   are looking forward to some of these things.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:25.380]   I wanna ask you a bigger question than that, right?
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.380]   And you know, once we pass through this temporary life,
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.540]   and when we think of heaven,
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.380]   what is it that you look forward to the most?
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.300]   Right, what is heaven that you imagine
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.420]   that causes you to think that, you know,
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.500]   like I can't wait to get there, right?
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.740]   You know, the statement that Jesus says,
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.060]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.980]   "No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.940]   He says that in the context of him promising them
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.300]   that he's going to the Father's house
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.880]   to prepare a place for them.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.580]   So in other words, he's talking about heaven.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.100]   And so he says to them, "Where I am going, you cannot come."
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.660]   And so they were very disturbed.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.260]   So in chapter 14, verse one, it says,
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.120]   "Do not let your hearts be troubled,"
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.480]   because they were asking, "Why can't we go with you?"
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.760]   And so this sixth statement,
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.700]   and we have one more statement of Jesus,
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.800]   I am divine, before he leaves,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.360]   but these last two statements are specifically directed
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.060]   toward his disciples to prepare them for his leaving.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.320]   And so he says that to actually give them comfort,
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.020]   because he has been making it clear that he's leaving.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.380]   He's leaving, and so it's starting to dawn on him,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.920]   like, "This doesn't make any sense.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.300]   "You told us to follow you.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.040]   "Now you're telling us that you're gonna leave,
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.580]   "and we can't follow you."
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.300]   And so in response to that, Jesus says,
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.240]   "Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.820]   "Where I am going, I need to go
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.000]   "in order to prepare a place for you in my Father's house.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.160]   "And when it is the right time,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.200]   "you will be able to come.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.500]   "Right now you can't come, but at the right time,
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.820]   "you're gonna be able to follow me."
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.180]   And then Thomas responds, like,
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.320]   "No, we do not know where you are going.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.400]   "How do we know the way?"
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.500]   So it is in response to this distressful question
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.620]   that Jesus responds and says, "I am the way.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   "I am the truth, and I am the life,
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.640]   "and no one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.160]   So even before we get into understanding
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.900]   what he is saying here, we need to
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.800]   understand the emphatic nature of this statement,
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.520]   because we know that all of the I am statements,
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.720]   even if Jesus said nothing else other than to say,
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.100]   "I am, I am, I am, I am,"
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.280]   we know that he was basically saying he is God.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.120]   Even if he said nothing other than I am.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.900]   So the I am statements alone, without what comes after,
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.280]   stands by itself, and that in and of itself
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.520]   would have been shocking.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.840]   How can you be I am?
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.120]   Because clearly he was pointing to the fact
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.960]   that the way God of the Old Testament, in Exodus,
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.960]   introduced himself, and Jesus is saying, "I am."
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.000]   Not I was, not I will be, but I am.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.660]   It is an emphatic statement on its own.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.360]   But along with that, he says, "I am the truth.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.640]   "I am the way, I am the life."
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.880]   And this article, the, in front of it,
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.840]   is something that we need to pay attention to,
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.960]   because he wasn't saying that he is a way.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.960]   He's the best way.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.400]   He says, "No, I am the way."
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.800]   So maybe a better way for us to understand it
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.620]   is him saying, "I am the only way.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.960]   "I am the only truth.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.180]   "I am the only life."
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.800]   And so obviously he's saying all of this
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.840]   is because he is preparing a way for them,
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.200]   and when he's talking about where he's going,
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.640]   he's talking about heaven.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.440]   So if you connect these two things together,
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.040]   what Jesus basically is saying,
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.860]   I am the only way to heaven.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.000]   I am the only truth to heaven.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.440]   I am the only life that leads you to heaven.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.080]   There is no other way.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.860]   And so with that, we wanna look at these three statements,
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.960]   and if you have the children's outline,
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.440]   some of you parents, under each one of these statements,
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.860]   I am the way, the truth, and the life,
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.040]   I divided into two parts under each title,
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.840]   because Jesus says this to, first of all,
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.600]   give them comfort, because they were very distressed,
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.460]   and then secondly, he's saying this to them
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.180]   to prepare them for what's coming,
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.020]   the trials that are coming.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.420]   So one is to comfort them, and second is to equip them.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.900]   And I think every truth that we learn in scripture
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.740]   really falls into those two categories.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.760]   Every truth that we have,
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.300]   it first causes us to be comforted.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.680]   When we hear about God's sovereignty,
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.760]   his nature of who he is, his sovereignty gives us comfort
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.260]   because we know that he is completely in control,
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.640]   that even in this pandemic, he didn't lose control.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.500]   Even with all the famine and with all the distress
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.420]   that we see around the world, God hasn't lost control.
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.100]   But at the same time, he is equipping us
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.820]   to recognize in order for us to be the true light
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.340]   in the world, we need to recognize that he is sovereign,
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.100]   not us.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.940]   So it equips us to strengthen us for the work
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.020]   that he has given us to do, to be the light.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.940]   So we're gonna look at each one of these things
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.120]   in these two categories, and the first one is,
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.360]   Jesus says, to comfort them, I am the way,
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.960]   I am the only way.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.260]   You can imagine how the disciples must have felt
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.580]   when they left everything to follow Christ.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.300]   Remember in the first I am statement,
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.780]   I am the bread of life, Jesus says,
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.740]   if you do not eat of my flesh and drink of my blood,
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.500]   you cannot be my disciples.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.700]   And in John chapter 6, 66, all of the disciples
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.180]   begin to turn away from him.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.760]   All those people who ate the miraculous feeding
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.960]   of the fish and the bread, they turn away
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.360]   and they leave him, and Jesus turns around
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.200]   and says, are you going to leave too?
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.500]   He says, no, we can't leave you.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.160]   We left everything to follow you.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:02.640]   Well, they've been following him with threats of death,
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   beating, isolation, hunger, and even with a deadly storm
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.580]   that came upon them.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.260]   But as long as they were with Jesus, they felt safe.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.660]   But now Jesus is saying, after he told them clearly,
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.440]   one of you are gonna betray me,
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.880]   and then prior to that, he's been repeatedly saying to them
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.920]   that I'm going to be caught, I'm going to be crucified,
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.860]   I'm going to die.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.500]   And though I will resurrect on the third day,
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.760]   he told them clearly what was coming.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   But right before the most difficult part of his ministry
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.720]   is about to happen, Jesus says, I'm leaving.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.820]   Right, they don't fully understand what's going on.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.220]   We left everything to follow you.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.680]   What do you mean that we cannot follow you?
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.420]   Well, he is saying this, again, not to say,
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.700]   you know, I'm gonna go hide and seek
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.320]   and see if you can come and find me.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.300]   In Joshua chapter 1, 9, as he was commanding,
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.820]   as God was commanding Joshua to go conquer
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:05.820]   this new land, fortified, right, with a bunch of soldiers
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.140]   who are wandering in the desert for 40 years, you know,
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.180]   and they're not trained soldiers.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.300]   They don't have the proper equipment.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.380]   They have their family and their children
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.940]   tagging along with them.
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.140]   How are they gonna conquer this great land?
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.740]   So if anybody wasn't, you can imagine the distress
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.940]   that Joshua was in, and God promises him this.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.660]   Have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous,
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.180]   do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.100]   is with you wherever you go.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.840]   In other words, God's promise to Joshua was,
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.740]   do not worry, I am with you.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.160]   I am with you.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.880]   Just like Jesus was in the storm with the disciples,
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.640]   and as they were afraid for their life,
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.760]   and Jesus said, you of little faith,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.340]   do you not believe who I am?
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.840]   And in essence, Jesus was comforting them in the same way.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.640]   Even though I am going, I am not leaving you, right?
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.120]   In fact, later on, we won't be going through this today,
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.240]   but he says, I'm not going to leave you.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.340]   I'm gonna be sending a comforter,
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.060]   and he's gonna guide you, he's gonna remind you
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.500]   of everything that I've said.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.860]   So the first statement, I am the way,
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.380]   is Jesus comforting them and reminding them,
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.760]   I am not leaving you.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.780]   Matthew 28, 19 to 20.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.020]   As he gives the Great Commission,
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.980]   you know, we have a tendency to focus on,
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.180]   go therefore, make disciples, baptizing them,
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.800]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you,
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.100]   but the essence of the Great Commandment
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.660]   isn't the instruction of going, baptizing, and teaching.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.260]   Even though those are the specific things
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.760]   that he has called it to do, he says,
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.820]   I am with you at the end of verse 20,
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.040]   even to the end of the age.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.340]   So any of you who've ever studied that passage,
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.780]   you know that he begins by saying,
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.220]   all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.100]   Therefore, go and make disciples.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.240]   And then he concludes it by saying,
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.320]   don't worry, I am going with you.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:11.360]   So the first reason why he makes a statement to us
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.440]   and to the disciples is to give us comfort.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.080]   That he didn't just leave us and say,
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.800]   hey, I hope you guys can make it.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.240]   It's gonna be a long journey.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.760]   There's gonna be a lot of trials, persecutions,
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.420]   hardship, famine, pestilence.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.200]   May come your way, but I hope you guys can make it.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.060]   And he was reminding them that he will never
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.980]   leave us or forsake us.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.240]   The path that we are to take,
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.840]   he's not just pointing us to the path.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.840]   He says, no, I am the path.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:47.060]   Years ago, I was in Knoxville.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.960]   Not Nashville, but Knoxville.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.520]   Nashville is where all the city is and big buildings,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.840]   and that's where they have the Sync Conference.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.560]   But I was in Knoxville to take care of some business.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.020]   What business that is, I don't have time
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.720]   to explain right now.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.640]   But I was in Knoxville and I had to meet some people
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.080]   and I had to do some stuff.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.040]   And after I took care of my business,
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.200]   I was on the way back to my hotel.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   This is before GPS.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.400]   And I got lost.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.080]   And anybody who's been in Knoxville,
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.040]   it's like Big Bear without the houses, basically.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.080]   And you have one building maybe every two, three miles.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.540]   And I got lost.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.160]   And it was two, three in the morning
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.120]   and I just couldn't find, I was like, oh my gosh,
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.520]   am I getting deeper into the woods
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.240]   and we're running out of gas?
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.640]   No GPS.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.400]   And back then, we didn't have, I don't remember,
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.560]   I don't think I had cell phones at that time.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.760]   So I remember just being anxious,
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.080]   being in the middle of nowhere.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.800]   And I remember seeing a light from way off in a distance,
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.920]   Walmart.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.040]   Here, Walmart is not 24/7, but over there,
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.240]   the Walmart is everything.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.740]   Like if you want to get your car fixed, you go to Walmart.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.560]   You want to buy meat, you go to Walmart.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.400]   Computer, you go to Walmart.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.480]   So Walmart was everything.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.160]   So as soon as I saw Walmart, I went and I asked.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.680]   They were very friendly, told me how
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.120]   to get back home to the hotel.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.840]   And I remember being so relieved.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.160]   Some of you guys may remember before we had GPS,
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.800]   being lost on the road.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.840]   Let's say if you're going to your friend's house
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.920]   that you've never been to, and then you got lost,
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.440]   the only way that we can find a pullover, find a phone,
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.480]   make sure you have enough change, put it in there.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.240]   Hopefully, he's by the phone so you can pick it up.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.880]   And then he gives you the instruction.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.340]   Hopefully, you have pen and paper.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.040]   You can write it down.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.120]   And then you go.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.720]   And then if that doesn't work, you
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.120]   got to pull over again and ask somebody.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.600]   That's what life used to be like.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.720]   Imagine if we were going to a friend's house
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.440]   and we got lost in a place like Knoxville.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.440]   And you're distressed.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.840]   You're running out of gas, middle of the night,
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.240]   and there is no Walmart.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.600]   Then all of a sudden, you see your friend
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.200]   standing by the side of the road.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.400]   And the moment that you see your friend,
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.720]   your anxiousness is gone.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.000]   You're no longer lost, even though you have no idea where
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.800]   you're at.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.760]   You're no longer lost because you
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.120]   were going to your friend's house
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.480]   and your friend is on the road.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.560]   So as soon as he gets in the car,
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.720]   you're not looking anymore.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.640]   You don't need the GPS.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.240]   There is no time crunch.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.960]   You don't have to worry about which road.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.240]   He tells you to make a left, you make a left.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.200]   He tells you to make a right, you make a right.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.480]   Even if you end up going nowhere,
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.040]   you're already there because you were going to see your friend
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.360]   and your friend is already in the car.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.480]   I'm saying this as an illustration
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.080]   because that's exactly what Jesus is saying to his disciples.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.760]   You're worried about getting to heaven.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.120]   He says, I am the way.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.440]   If you are with me, if you are with me,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.120]   you don't need to strive.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.400]   You don't need to be lost.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:55.200]   All that feeling of anxiousness, time crunch, purposefulness,
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.960]   instantaneously is answered when Christ is in your car.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.280]   See, that's what he was saying.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.420]   The first and most important part of the statement,
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.840]   I am the way, is reminding his disciples,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.040]   even though I will physically be gone, I will not leave you.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:10.760]   I am with you.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.840]   I am the way.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.040]   But the second part of this is to prepare them
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.320]   for what was coming.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.760]   John 13, this is a passage that we read in the beginning.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:23.720]   It says, Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going?
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.920]   Jesus answered, where I go, you cannot follow me now,
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.960]   but you will follow later.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.640]   Peter, he's the outspoken one.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.280]   He's the guy that is like, no.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.240]   He's the guy with the extra testosterone.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.840]   He's not going to be like these other guys.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.200]   Like, I will die for you.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.740]   What do you mean we can't follow you?
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.600]   I will follow you.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.400]   I got my knife.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.560]   I will follow you.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.080]   Lord, why can't I follow you?
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.480]   I will lay down my life for you.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.320]   And I don't think Peter was just talking.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.400]   I think Peter really meant it.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.760]   And the reason why I say that is because when
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.320]   the soldiers came to get Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.040]   Peter actually took out the sword.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:09.360]   And he actually swung it, even though he actually missed it.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.640]   Obviously, he was a fisherman.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.560]   He was not a soldier.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.560]   But the fact that he was willing to do that,
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.240]   and even though they probably were outnumbered maybe 100
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.360]   to 1--
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.640]   at least that's what the records say.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.080]   Probably they were outnumbered at least 100 to 1.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.700]   Peter meant it.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.920]   Even though he meant it, he didn't know himself
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.840]   as well as Jesus did.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.720]   Jesus answered, will you lay down your life for me?
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.080]   In other words, you will not.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.960]   Truly, truly, I say to you, a rooster
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.120]   will not crow until you deny me three times.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.640]   So again, remember, he's saying this in the context of him,
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.600]   reminding them, I am the way.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.120]   I am the truth.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:58.240]   In other words, he's telling Peter, Peter, I'm going.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.960]   You're not going to be able to follow me.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:03.160]   You are not going to be able to follow me.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.840]   In other words, no matter how determined you are,
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:12.680]   your loyalty, your desire to do good, your talent,
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.080]   your ability, your experiences, you
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.400]   will not be able to follow me.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.680]   Remember what Jesus said?
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.720]   Where are you going?
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.920]   I am going to my father's house, to heaven,
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.400]   to prepare a place for you.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.160]   No.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.560]   Is heaven not ready?
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.880]   When Jesus came down, did he just lay the foundation?
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:30.520]   He's going back.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.640]   Now I got to prepare the room.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.960]   And Jesus has a hammer and nails.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.120]   And he's preparing a room.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.440]   For the last 2,000 years, he's been working at it.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.960]   And when the rooms are ready, a million rooms,
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.080]   maybe that's why it's taking 2,000 years,
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.440]   there's a lot of rooms.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.680]   What does he mean by he's preparing a room for them?
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:57.840]   He's not preparing heaven for the people.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.400]   He's preparing people for heaven.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   Let me say that again.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.200]   He's not preparing rooms because they're undone.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.760]   He didn't leave heaven incomplete.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.080]   He came down here to prepare us for heaven.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.040]   And what he was telling Peter was, Peter,
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.280]   you cannot follow me.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.960]   That's why I go to prepare.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.920]   He's talking about the cross.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.400]   And the first thing that Peter needed to learn
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.120]   was that way is not you.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.280]   It's not your determination.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.800]   It's not your ability.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.720]   It's not your loyalty.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.800]   It's not even your love for me.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.600]   I go to prepare a way for you.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.000]   So he was preparing the disciples for what is coming.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.280]   He's going to go to the cross.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.840]   And they may not fully understand at this point,
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.640]   but once he dies and he resurrects,
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.080]   that they will remember that Jesus is the way.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.640]   That's why it says in Luke 9.23, "And he was saying to them,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.800]   oh, if anyone wishes to come after me,
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.920]   he must deny himself, take up his cross daily,
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.520]   and follow me."
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.240]   We live our whole lives trying to find ourselves.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.280]   Am I an introvert?
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.440]   Am I an extrovert?
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.120]   Do I like this?
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.920]   Do I like that?
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.760]   What kind of gift?
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.400]   What's my gift?
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.000]   That's one of the-- even as Christians,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.240]   we're always looking for, what's my gift?
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.080]   And in a way, we're all trying to find ourselves.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.000]   Like, who am I so that I can live and I can have a purpose?
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.720]   I can do this and I can do that.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.360]   But the primary thing that the Bible tells us
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:31.320]   is to lose ourselves, to die to ourselves.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.280]   As Peter is saying, no, I'm going to lay down my life.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.440]   He's like, will you truly do that, Peter?
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.600]   Will you truly do that?
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.640]   Will you truly serve me?
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.960]   Will you truly sacrifice?
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.320]   Do you really think you can do that?
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.560]   So the first thing that they need to be comforted by
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.880]   and also reminded by, it is not you.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.800]   I am the only way.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.800]   Christ is the only way.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.360]   Now, if you're out there listening
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.840]   and you're not a Christian, you don't believe this,
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.840]   I mean, that's an arrogant thing to say,
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:10.040]   especially in this pluralistic, postmodern culture,
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.680]   for you to stand there and say-- and not just me.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.040]   Anybody who's teaching the Bible will say the same thing.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.800]   He is not just saying, he's a good way.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.200]   He says, I am the only way.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.000]   In fact, we have more and more people, even people
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.280]   who claim to be Christians, saying
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.120]   that it's arrogant for us to say he's the only way.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.400]   You could say he's a good way.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.040]   Maybe you could even say he's the best way.
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.080]   That's an arrogant thing to say, but maybe you
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.760]   can even say that.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:43.840]   But to say he's the only way, it sounds arrogant.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.200]   In fact, it seems a lot more humble and gracious
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:51.320]   to say that he is my way, but maybe not your way.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.560]   And the reason why there's less and less people who
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.920]   are able to say this emphatically
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.240]   is because they themselves are not sure.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.120]   Either they have weak faith or they have no faith,
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.400]   because you never run into a burning building and say,
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.760]   hey, I have three options for you.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.760]   You could believe that it's burning.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.680]   And you could believe that you can believe
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.960]   you can go through the store and you'll save your life,
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.320]   but I'm not going to judge you.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.720]   That sounds kind of arrogant.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:30.120]   Depending on the message, the message has to be crystal clear,
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.040]   and Jesus made that crystal clear.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.400]   And the reason why he says that is not arrogant.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.160]   It's because it's true.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.200]   He's telling people who are under the condemnation of God,
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:45.440]   and the only way to heaven is through Christ.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.520]   That's what he was saying.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.920]   I am the way, the only way.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.480]   And the disciples needed to know that,
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.240]   because every stage of their ministry,
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.960]   they will be challenged by the pagan world
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.600]   that they're going to evangelize.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.160]   Every city that they go to.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:04.320]   How dare you say Jesus is the only way?
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.360]   We have thousands of other idols,
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.480]   and you're saying of all the thousands of idols,
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.040]   you, this puny little nation of Israel,
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.840]   that your Messiah supersedes Caesar?
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.840]   Of all the other gods that we've been worshiping,
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.460]   you're saying all of that is nullified,
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:22.400]   and only Jesus is the only way?
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.480]   That's exactly what Jesus was saying.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.040]   So he was not only comforting them,
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.400]   he was preparing them for what was to come.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.600]   Secondly, and again, the most important point
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.040]   was the first one, but the second,
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.880]   he said Jesus is the truth.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.520]   Not only is he the only way, he's the only truth.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.560]   He comforts them in John 14, 18.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.480]   I will not leave you as orphans.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.920]   I will come to you.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.000]   And then he promises them the Holy Spirit.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.560]   And the primary work of the Holy Spirit is not feeling,
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.920]   is not louder worship.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.840]   He said the primary reason why the comforter is
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.200]   going to come to you is that he's
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.760]   going to remind you of everything
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.240]   that I have taught you.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.000]   That's what he says.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.920]   The primary duty of the Holy Spirit
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.080]   is to convict the world of sin and to remind
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:15.680]   the Christians continually of the truth of Jesus Christ.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.480]   He says, I am the truth.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.660]   Again, in John 6, 66, when Jesus turns to his disciples,
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.000]   when all the other were leaving, are you going to leave too?
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.880]   As a result of this, many of his disciples
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.680]   withdrew and were not walking with him anymore.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.160]   So Jesus said to the 12, you do not want to go away,
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.440]   also do you.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.720]   Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.240]   You have the words of eternal life.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.040]   You have the words of eternal life.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.040]   I may not fully understand you, and you've just
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.360]   said some crazy stuff about eating your flesh
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.360]   and drinking your blood.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.320]   So I don't really fully get what you're doing.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.440]   You say you're going to the cross to be crucified.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.240]   How could you do that?
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:57.960]   You're the Messiah.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:02.400]   Who's going to sit to the left or to the right?
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.760]   That's what the disciples were concerned about.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:08.040]   That's what they were debating and fighting over.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:11.000]   I don't fully understand what you're doing,
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.280]   but we believe you.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.560]   You have the words of truth.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.280]   In 1 Timothy 2, 5 through 6, it says,
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:22.360]   for there is one God and one mediator between God and men,
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.080]   the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.960]   as a ransom for all, the testimony given
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.440]   at the proper time.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.280]   There's only one mediator.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.960]   There's only one path.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.680]   There's only one truth.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:41.040]   You know, that ought to bring tremendous comfort for all
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.760]   of us, because the truth doesn't change.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.200]   But it also equips us to be able to live
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.240]   in this relativistic society.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.360]   You know, more and more, you hear people saying,
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.480]   like, you know, there is no absolute truth.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.120]   It's only relative truth.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.160]   Relative truth, that statement alone is an oxymoron.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.200]   Relative truth, like jumbo shrimp.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.520]   These are oxymorons.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.680]   Those two words really don't go together.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.960]   Either it's truth or it is relative.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.320]   By nature, truth does not change.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:19.200]   When you say that that's truth, it does not change.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.800]   Truth, by nature, is inflexible.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.240]   If you say it's truth, but it's flexible,
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.680]   it's no longer truth.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.960]   It's opinion.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.120]   It's maybe your thought.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.560]   It could be a philosophy.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:34.800]   But it's not truth.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:39.680]   The term truth, by the nature of the word, is inflexible.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.400]   It does not change based on culture.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.320]   Like, oh, that truth was good in the poor areas.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.040]   That truth was good 2,000 years when
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.800]   they didn't know all of this other stuff,
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.000]   all these other facts.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.760]   But now it's no longer true today.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.920]   If it was truth then, it has to be true now.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.400]   That's the nature of the word truth.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:04.120]   Truth does not change based on generation.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.320]   You know, you teach the gospel this way to the old people,
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.480]   but to the new generation who is computerized,
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.560]   and the gospel needs to change for them.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:14.760]   They're not going to accept this.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.560]   By nature, if we say it's truth, truth does not change.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.680]   It is inflexible.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.200]   It's not based on preference.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.280]   Truth is truth.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.560]   You know, 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.520]   It's not 2 for 2-year-olds and 3 for 5-year-olds
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.520]   and then 10 for 30-year-olds.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.680]   1 plus 1 used to be 2 10, 20 years ago.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.600]   But 50 years from now, it's going to be 4.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.360]   No, then it's not fact.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:44.560]   It's not truth.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.760]   By nature, truth is inflexible.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.880]   It does not change by preference, by culture,
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.600]   by generation, by age.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.680]   Therefore, truth is never new.
[00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:01.000]   Because truth is inflexible, it has been true all along.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.600]   Truth, because it is inflexible, is the foundation upon anything
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.520]   that we built. You don't build a building
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.000]   that you want to last on sand.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.920]   Because the sand always changes.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.880]   It shifts.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.640]   One day, one part of sand will be there.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.600]   And then when the waves come at night,
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.440]   there's a different part of sand there.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.520]   And then when the waves come in, a different part of sand there.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.120]   And when it's wet, it feels different.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.560]   When it's dry, it feels different.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.920]   So the sand is always shifting, always changing.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.960]   That's why the Bible tells us not to build our house upon sand.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.840]   Because sand always changes.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.880]   But the truth, whenever we build something,
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880]   what do we build it on?
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.000]   We build on something that does not move.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.520]   That's why we pour concrete.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.080]   Because we don't want it moving.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.760]   Even if everything around it moves,
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.080]   we don't want the foundation to be moving.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.840]   That's why Jesus is called the cornerstone.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.400]   That's what he means when he says, I am the truth.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.200]   We don't anchor.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.240]   We don't anchor our boat.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   If we don't want it to move, we don't anchor it
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.000]   on something that is also moving.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.080]   Because then you're not anchored.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.520]   To be anchored in something means
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.160]   you are hooking your boat onto something
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.880]   that's going to remain the same no matter what happens,
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.200]   whether it's a big wave or a small wave,
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.480]   whether it's calm waters, that you're
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   going to sit there two, three hours later, four, five days
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.400]   later, you're going to be in the exact same place.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.900]   That's why the whole book of Hebrews
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.040]   is to be anchored in Christ.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:39.080]   And if Christ is not the truth, we can't anchor with him.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.520]   Because we don't know where that's
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.760]   going to take us a year from now or 10 years from now,
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.560]   whether we're young, whether we're married,
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.320]   or whether we're old, or whether we're retired.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.800]   That's what he means when he says
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.240]   that we are anchored in Christ, that he is the truth.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.760]   And he is preparing them.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.720]   He's preparing them because they will be challenged over
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.380]   and over again.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.880]   Remember what Paul says in Corinthians,
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.120]   chapter 122 to 24, for indeed, Jews ask for signs.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.560]   Greeks search for wisdom.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.320]   But we preach Christ crucified to Jews, a stumbling block,
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.960]   and Gentiles' foolishness, but to those
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.000]   who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.680]   of God, and the wisdom of God.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.360]   You know why Paul was saying this?
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:28.480]   It's because there was constant, constant complaint.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.880]   Maybe if we went to this next city, right?
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.560]   We went to Philippi, and we got beaten up and thrown into jail.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.040]   So maybe next time we go to Athens,
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.920]   maybe we try a different method, right?
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.200]   Because they want some power.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.800]   I mean, Paul, you're an apostle.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.120]   I mean, you can raise people from the dead.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.480]   You can open their eyes.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.280]   Wisdom, man, your disciple was Gamaliel.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.280]   I mean, you're one of the most educated person in Israel.
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.560]   And you are the most powerful.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.280]   So my guess is there was constant temptation
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.960]   to say, you know what?
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.360]   I'm so tired of getting beaten up in the cities.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.960]   And sometimes it seems like it bears a lot of fruit,
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.440]   and sometimes it's like nobody cares.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.760]   Let's try something else.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.520]   Jews ask for signs, right?
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.880]   Although, it's the other way.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.560]   Jews ask for wisdom, right?
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.960]   And the Gentiles look for power, signs.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.440]   But he said, no, we preach Christ crucified.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.080]   What seems foolishness to you, it
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.640]   is the power of God unto salvation.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.840]   And that's what Jesus meant.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.080]   I go to prepare a way for you.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.040]   These signs and wonders may tickle their ears.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.600]   It may be sensational for a period,
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.560]   but it has no power to save you.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.120]   The only way that we can be prepared to go to heaven
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.520]   is Christ crucified.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.480]   And that's why Paul says, though they want signs,
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.360]   though they want wisdom, we preach Christ crucified.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.440]   Third and finally, Jesus is the life.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.280]   Again, to comfort them, in John 14, 19,
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.960]   he says, after a little while, the world
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.680]   will no longer see me, but you will see me, because I live.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.520]   You will live also.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.920]   Now, obviously, the disciples didn't clearly
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.880]   understand what he was saying.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.400]   Because after Jesus resurrects, they don't even go to the tomb.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   Because as long as he lives--
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.680]   I mean, Jesus says some crazy stuff.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.000]   Walks on water.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.520]   We don't have bread.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.040]   Just give it to them.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.800]   We don't have money to pay taxes.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.760]   Open that fish's mouth, and there's some gold in there.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.640]   I mean, he did some crazy stuff.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.000]   So even though we don't get him, as long as he is living,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.800]   as long as he is with us, we have hope.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.240]   But after Jesus dies, even though he made it very clear,
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.640]   resurrection wasn't part of their paradigm.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.520]   Because miracles, they can see, because they've seen it.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.960]   Walking on water, calming the storm,
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.600]   paying bills out of fish's mouth,
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.680]   feeding thousands of hungry people,
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.920]   that's within their paradigm.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.440]   I mean, their paradigm got stretched
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   by watching and walking with Jesus.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.360]   But death is final.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.120]   So even though Jesus made it very clear
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.200]   he's going to resurrect on the third day,
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.360]   they lost hope when he died.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.160]   And they were distressed.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.320]   They were confused.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.720]   And they were in fear.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:37.560]   If they can kill him, clearly they can kill us.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.360]   We left everything to follow Jesus.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.840]   Whether it's the disciples or it's us,
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.520]   we follow Jesus because we think it's a good investment.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.360]   Nobody follows Jesus and say, you know what?
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.320]   I'm going to be crucified.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.560]   And for eternity, I'm going to be crucified.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.600]   Nobody.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.120]   We pick up our cross and follow him
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.560]   because following him means there's
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.880]   glory on the other side.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.880]   The disciples left everything to follow Jesus,
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.920]   because he's the Messiah.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.440]   Because they thought at some point,
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.320]   if they put in their time, if they keep with him,
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.000]   that they're going to also see glory.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.760]   And they weren't wrong, because Jesus did say that.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.200]   He did say glory was coming.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.840]   But what he did say was glory was
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.160]   going to come through the cross.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.840]   And that's why they were distressed.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.320]   We followed you because we thought
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   at the end of this road, there was going to be better life.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.480]   But if you go to the cross, what does that mean?
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.200]   If you die, what hope is there?
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.000]   So Jesus is comforting them.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.480]   I am the way.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.720]   I am the truth.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.760]   I am the life.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.960]   There is no other path.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.040]   If you go another path, there is no path of life
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.400]   by being a great fisherman.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.040]   There's no path of life by becoming a Sanhedrin.
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.920]   No amount of wealth is going to get you into the kingdom.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:07.960]   John 4, 13 to 14, "Jesus answered and said to her,
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.440]   the woman at the well, everyone who drinks of this water
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.280]   will thirst again.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.660]   But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.840]   shall never thirst.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.160]   But the water that I will give him
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.960]   will become in him a well of water,
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:23.360]   springing up to eternal life."
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.600]   He's comforting them.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.800]   Yes, I'm going to prepare a way for you.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.320]   Yes, I will die.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.000]   But I will resurrect.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.120]   And you will also die.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   But you will also resurrect.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.560]   He was preparing them for the hardship that's coming.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.000]   Even in death, you will live.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.240]   John 11, 25 to 26, "Jesus said to her,
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.960]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.080]   He who believes in me will live even if he dies.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.440]   And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.640]   Do you believe this?"
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.040]   This is the crux of the matter right here.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.040]   Everything that you've heard about Christianity
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.600]   really can be summed up by this statement and this challenge,
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.120]   that even if you die, you will live.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.680]   Do you believe this?
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.680]   It's like, well, I believe Jesus is a great guy.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.000]   I believe Jesus is going to prepare a way for heaven.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.720]   I believe he answers my prayer.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.760]   He loves me.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.680]   Unconditionally, I trust him.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.960]   You can say all of these stuff, and all of these things
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.480]   are true, but all of that is founded upon this statement.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.000]   Even if you die, you will live.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.560]   Do you believe this?
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.120]   Because if we don't believe this,
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.600]   we will see Jesus as an avenue, as a means,
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.800]   that if we follow him, maybe he'll answer our prayers.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.880]   Maybe he'll make us great.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.200]   Maybe he'll keep our children safe.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.120]   And maybe he'll bless our business.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.200]   And he'll pay our bills.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.040]   And that we can have a nice, peaceful, long life,
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.520]   raise good children in a nice place.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.760]   Because that's how we'll see Jesus.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.920]   But that was not his invitation.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.120]   He said to pick up your cross and follow me.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.840]   Because even if you die, you will live.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.280]   Do you believe this?
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.640]   So all the other things that we obey Christ
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.880]   is founded upon this truth.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.760]   Do I believe this?
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:31.560]   Because if I believe this, and I no longer fear death,
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.680]   it frees me to be able to live the life
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.280]   that Christ wants me to live.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.640]   But as long as I am afraid to die,
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.960]   we will always be bound by this fear.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.080]   Our obedience will always have a limit to where we will go.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.040]   Our life will always be limited by the boundaries that
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.040]   are set because of this fear.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.800]   If you believe me, even if you die, you will live.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.040]   Do you believe this?
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.040]   Let me conclude with this.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:11.080]   And I'm going to skip two verses and get to Colossians 3, 4.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.920]   It says, "When Christ, who is our life, is revealed,
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.840]   then you also will be revealed with him in glory."
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.260]   There's a couple of things that we need to recognize here.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.240]   First of all, that Christ is our life.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.800]   He says, Christ, who is your life?
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.840]   Is he our life?
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.720]   Is he a part of our life?
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.960]   Is he a source of life?
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.280]   Or is he our life?
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.680]   Do we live because we're with him?
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.360]   Is he the one that we pursue?
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.280]   Is he the way?
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.440]   Is he the truth?
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.400]   Is he our life?
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.320]   But along with that, what the statement says
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.720]   is, Christ, who is our life, when he is revealed,
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.520]   you will also be revealed with him in glory.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:55.240]   In other words, he's saying, this is not your life.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.520]   So your pursuit of this world, pursuit of recognition,
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.200]   pursuit of comfort, pursuit of safety,
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.960]   pursuit of retirement, pursuit of whatever
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.040]   it is that we're looking for, he said, no, that is not
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.520]   your life.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.720]   When Christ, who is your life, when he appears,
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.200]   glory is coming.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.920]   And that's what makes us Christian,
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.280]   because life is not here.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.240]   Whether we are quarantined for the rest of our lives,
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   or whether we come out and flourish and have the freedom
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.920]   to do whatever we want, Paul says,
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.440]   I have learned the secret of being content in every
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.040]   and all situation, whether he has plenty,
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.720]   whether he has little.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.680]   Whether he's sitting in prison or whether he's
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.760]   free to do whatever he wants, he has learned
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.920]   the secret of being content.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:50.400]   And that secret of being content is Christ being his life.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.160]   Because his life doesn't come with safety.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.960]   His life doesn't come with health.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.960]   His life isn't connected to whether he's in a prison
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.640]   or whether he's outside a prison.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.560]   His life is Christ.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.400]   And no matter what circumstance he's in,
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.800]   they can't take that away from him.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.240]   What can separate us from the love of Christ?
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.840]   Is Christ our life?
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.040]   The disciples needed to not only be comforted by this,
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.320]   they needed to be equipped with this.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.200]   Because Jesus was going to send them
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:29.560]   into a very difficult situation.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.320]   And all of them are going to be killed,
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.440]   with the exception of one.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.720]   And even the one that wasn't killed,
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.280]   it would have been easy for him if he just ended his life,
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.360]   if you know what happened to Apostle John.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.440]   Every single one of them, not only did they understand this,
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.680]   but they believed it with all their heart.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.760]   And they were willing to give their life
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.960]   that other people may have this as well.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.800]   So this sixth statement, I am the way, the truth,
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.040]   and the life.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.840]   No one comes to the Father but through me.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.360]   And let me encourage you this morning with this.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.040]   I'm not asking you to sing this song.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.500]   So if you know it, you can sing it.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.680]   But the next--
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.080]   I have a video that I want you to watch and sing along
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:10.600]   internally.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.480]   But if you look at the song, there's
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:17.160]   six separate circumstances that people are in.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.800]   And the conclusion of each of this is Christ.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.200]   Weak and wounded sinner, lost and left to die,
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.440]   oh, raise your head, for love is passing by.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.960]   Come to Jesus, come to Jesus.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.360]   Come to Jesus and live.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.720]   Now your burden's lifted and carried far away,
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:38.520]   and precious blood has washed away the stain.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:43.840]   Sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus and live.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.800]   And like newborn baby, don't be afraid to crawl.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.960]   And remember, when you walk, sometimes we fall.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:57.360]   So fall on Jesus, fall on Jesus, fall on Jesus and live.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:04.520]   Sometimes the way is lonely and steep and filled with pain.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:10.880]   So if your sky is dark and pours the rain, then cry to Jesus.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.040]   Cry to Jesus.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.080]   Cry to Jesus and live.
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.680]   Oh, when the love spills over and music fills the night,
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.920]   and when you can't contain your joy inside,
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.880]   then dance for Jesus.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.640]   Dance for Jesus.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.200]   Dance for Jesus and live.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.680]   And then finally, at the end of our lives,
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:34.960]   and with your final heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:40.480]   Then go in peace and laugh on glory side, and fly to Jesus.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.400]   Fly to Jesus.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.320]   Fly to Jesus and live.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.960]   I pray that this song will minister to you.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:52.560]   And as you listen, and hopefully it would be your prayer.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.560]   So I'm just going to ask you to listen to that,
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.920]   and then our worship team is going
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.680]   to lead us in our final praise afterwards.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.640]   [MUSIC - "I'M GOING TO FIND YOU"]
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.080]   [PIANO PLAYING]
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:22.040]   Weak and wounded sinner, lost and left to die.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.880]   Oh, raise your head for love is passing by.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.480]   Come to Jesus.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.000]   Come to Jesus.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   Come to Jesus and live.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:50.960]   Now your burden's lifted and carried far away.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.280]   And precious blood has washed away the stain.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.640]   So sing to Jesus.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.960]   Sing to Jesus.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.920]   Sing to Jesus and live.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:19.040]   And like a newborn baby, don't be afraid to crawl.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:25.520]   And remember when you walk, sometimes we fall.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.320]   So fall on Jesus.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.880]   Fall on Jesus.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.840]   Fall on Jesus and live.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:47.320]   Sometimes the way is lonely.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.960]   It's still filled with pain.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:59.000]   So if your sky is dark and pours no rain, then cry to Jesus.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.080]   Cry to Jesus.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:10.480]   Cry to Jesus and live.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:22.320]   Oh, and when the love spills over and music fills the night,
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:28.240]   and when you can't contain your joy inside,
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.840]   then dance for Jesus.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.240]   Dance for Jesus.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:40.200]   Dance for Jesus and live.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:50.200]   And with your final heartbeat, kiss the world goodbye.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:55.200]   Then go in peace and laugh on glory's side.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:03.200]   And fly to Jesus.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.200]   Fly to Jesus.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:20.200]   Fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, and live.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:40.200]   Fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, and live.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:47.200]   Church family, why don't we all go ahead and stand for our closing praise.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:13.200]   When I fear my faith will fail, Christ will hold me fast.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   When the tempter would prevail, He will hold me fast.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:31.200]   I could never keep my hold through life's fearful path.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:41.200]   For my love is often cold, He must hold.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:51.200]   He will hold me fast, He will hold me fast.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:20.200]   Sing it out, "Those He saves." Those He saves are His delight.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   Christ will hold me fast, precious in His holy sight.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:38.200]   He will hold me fast, He'll not let my soul be lost.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:50.200]   His promises shall last, but by Him at such a cross, He will hold.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:21:02.200]   He will hold me fast, He will hold me fast.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:12.200]   For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:34.200]   For my life, He bled and died, Christ will hold me fast.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:43.200]   Justice has been satisfied, He will hold me fast.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:53.200]   Raised with Him to endless life, He will hold me fast.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:22:04.200]   Till my faith is turned to stone, when He comes at last.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:12.200]   He will hold me fast, He will hold me fast.
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:21.200]   For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:29.200]   He will hold me fast, He will hold me fast.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:40.200]   For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:57.200]   Alright, let's pray.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:04.200]   As Jews look for signs and Greeks look for wisdom,
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.200]   help us Lord God to preach Christ crucified.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:11.200]   That we would not turn to the left or to the right.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:18.200]   That we would cling to Him as He is our way, the truth, and our life.
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:28.200]   Lord, we eagerly desire Lord to one day to be with Christ and with You in Your home, Father God, for eternity.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:36.200]   I pray that the hope that we have in Christ will become even more heightened, Lord God, because of what's going on.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:42.200]   And if our light has been dim throughout the months and the years that led up to this,
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:48.200]   I pray, Father God, that You would help us, help us to be reflective,
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:54.200]   help us, Lord God, to allow Your Word to judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:59.200]   Help us, Lord God, to see the world as You see it, like sheep without shepherds.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.200]   That we may rejoice with You, Father God, as the Gospel goes to the remotest parts of the world.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:08.200]   I pray that You would equip our church, strengthen us,
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:15.200]   whether we are at home or whether we are at work, whether we are resting or we are laboring for Your kingdom.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.200]   That whether we eat or drink, may Christ be glorified.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:27.200]   And so we pray that as we have another week, I pray for our brothers and sisters, Lord, who may be struggling with financial burdens.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:33.200]   I pray, Father God, that as they seek Your kingdom first, that all these things shall be added unto them.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:39.200]   I pray, Father God, for those who have lost loved ones this week.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:45.200]   I pray that You would bring comfort to them, knowing, Father God, that You are the resurrection and the life.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.200]   That their separation is temporary.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.200]   And that soon enough, that we will be reunited with our loved ones.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:25:01.200]   So we pray for Your grace and Your truth to sustain and strengthen us, Lord God, for the rest of this week.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:07.200]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and eternal love of God the Father.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.200]   Rest, restore, strengthen and equip Your children for the sake of Your glory. Amen.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   God sent His Son.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:24.200]   They called Him Jesus.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:35.200]   He came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:46.200]   He lived and died to buy my poverty.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:57.200]   An empty grave is there to hold my Savior there.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:08.200]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:20.200]   Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:31.200]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:43.200]   And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:51.200]   Jesus, help me trust You more and more.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:27:02.200]   Jesus, only Jesus, bring my heart the air to hold.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:08.200]   I will trust my Savior Jesus.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:13.200]   He has set His way, His best.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:23.200]   And I know the path He's chosen leads to everlasting rest.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:33.200]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust You more and more.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:43.200]   Jesus, only Jesus, bring my heart the air to hold.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:53.200]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust You more and more.
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:28:03.200]   Jesus, only Jesus, bring my heart the air to hold.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:26.200]   [Music]
