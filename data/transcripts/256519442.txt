[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.260]   But obviously, this is something grandly much more than that.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.560]   This is not a, "Oh, nice, you're taking your faith a little bit more seriously now."
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.040]   This is an immense, immense moment because we realize that the baptism ceremony signifies
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.440]   a grand spiritual truth of the salvation of your soul.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.840]   And so in order to prepare our hearts, I want to point our minds to the fact that, yes,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.040]   visually they're entering into water, coming out of the water, all to symbolize the truth
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.040]   of salvation.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.040]   That as they do that by faith, they're uniting with Christ through faith.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.160]   That their lives will be wrapped up in Christ.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.760]   And that by their union, they would enter the water, symbolizing their death with Christ.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.940]   That His sacrificial death is covering them.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.560]   And so the penalty that they deserve for their sins is satisfied.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.040]   And in rising out of the water, they're uniting with Christ in His resurrection.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.480]   That they would symbolize their newness of life that they have before the Lord.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.240]   That God would cause them to be an absolutely new creation.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.940]   These are all immensely huge spiritual realities.
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.880]   And a thing that I want to point to is the fact that this huge stark contrast is the
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.200]   contrast between death and life.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.280]   Is the contrast between far, far away from God as opposed to being one with God.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.800]   It is not just a little line in the sand.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.160]   This is a huge chasm wider than the Grand Canyon.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.760]   And so when I say this is a huge moment for you not to be taken lightly, this is absolutely
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   true.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.200]   But what's more, even what Jesus says in this passage that we're looking at, I'm going to
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.440]   make the case that this is more important than obviously any graduation you would participate
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.920]   in, especially because we have some students here.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.440]   It's bigger than your high school graduation.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.960]   It's bigger than even, may we say, marriage day.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.400]   It's bigger than perhaps in the future, the first time you grow your family and have a
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.560]   child.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.080]   It might be even bigger than 50th anniversary.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080]   It's big.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.600]   It's huge in its importance.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.200]   And Christ is going to explain all the more why it is so important by the way He describes
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000]   what salvation is in this one perspective.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.840]   Taking a look at this passage again, in Luke chapter 13, an individual who was walking
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.280]   with Christ simply asked a theological question or maybe even a question of reality.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.840]   "Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?"
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.240]   And Jesus answers by saying, "Strive to enter through the narrow door.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.760]   For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able."
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.880]   That is quite one of the more difficult passages in Scripture to swallow, to comprehend.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.360]   Are you saying that there are individuals who would actually want, they have a desire
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   to enter into the kingdom and yet might not be able?
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.400]   So the very first point I have for you in looking at that answer that Christ gives is
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.320]   that this is a huge moment for you.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.840]   This is something of a privilege because there is a natural limitation to what Jesus says.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.920]   And the point is, what you participate in today, only very few can say that they have
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.800]   as well.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.560]   Only very few can say that they have.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.320]   Although yes, we understand that the gospel of Christ is an offer, is an invitation that
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.280]   has been cast to many, the sobering reality of it is there is a limitation because Jesus
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.120]   in his answer, he answers indirectly, but the way that he answers clearly says the statement
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.640]   of the reality that it is a limited few.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.840]   And therefore, we need to have a very thankful attitude, a very privileged attitude of this
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.400]   that has been given a narrow door.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.200]   A narrow door by which we must enter has been given to us.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.720]   He continues this theme of having a limited nature by the things he says next.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.280]   Take a look at verse 25 and following.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.480]   He says, "Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.160]   outside and knock on the door saying, 'Lord, open up to us,' then he will answer and say
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.280]   to you, 'I do not know where you are from.'
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.240]   Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence and you taught in our streets.'
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.040]   And he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you are from, depart from me, all you
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.040]   evildoer.'"
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.680]   The next point I have for you is on top of the fact that this is something in many ways
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.200]   reserved for a very few, there is the reality that God will close the door.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.000]   God will close the door, he said.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.800]   But there is a limitation, we can just simply say, on time.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.040]   That God says in this passage, or Christ says in this passage, in yes, this is parabolic
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.520]   way, that God is going to, the owner of the owner is going to shut the door and even if
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.240]   people ask, he's going to say, "I don't know you."
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.540]   I want us to think about that for a moment.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.200]   Have you heard perhaps a gospel message where somebody has said to you, "Take your time,
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.800]   think about this.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.600]   Sit over what's been said."
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.120]   Now all that, fair enough, sure, of course you want to be informed.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.840]   But is it a true statement that God will always be there whenever you're ready?
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.560]   That no matter how long you take, no matter how many chances you have, that God will extend
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.480]   his hand of grace to you?
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.840]   According to this, just as in the time of Noah, when Noah built an ark, and in the appropriate
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.240]   time it says that as the animals entered, as the family entered, it was God who shut
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.400]   the door.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.600]   That's really interesting to think about.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.560]   For us, if ever we thought, maybe because we think, "I've got plenty of time, I haven't
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.600]   reached a certain stage of my life."
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.960]   There are a lot of people who are getting baptized who are really young.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   They're high school students, they're freshmen in college, so what, 16, 17, 18.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.400]   I'm so glad that you have heeded this call of God.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.200]   Because although yes, you are young, you're absolutely right to feel a sense of urgency
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.080]   to decide now.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.880]   Because it is an absolute lie if we believe, "I have plenty of years to decide."
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.200]   If we believe, "I'm young and I have plenty of time.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   Once I reach a certain stage, once I reach that college years, once I reach that age
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.680]   when I'm an adult, once I reach that age when I have a family, once certain things
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.000]   are set and stable, then I'll think about it."
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.120]   That is an absolute lie.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.280]   So there is this urgency, and that urgency continues starting from verse 26, and we repeat
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.800]   that verse 26 down to verse 28.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.720]   Take a look what he says.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.440]   He talks about how the people who are shut outside, how they will speak.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.680]   He says, "Then you will begin to say, 'We ate, drank in your presence, and you taught
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.280]   in our streets.'
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.520]   And then he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you are from.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.200]   Depart from me, all you evil doers.'
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:37.280]   Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves being thrown out."
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.640]   The point I want to make with that is, added to the sense of urgency is how final it will
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.840]   be.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.640]   It is going to be absolutely final.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.180]   In this passage, I want to highlight, no matter what excuse, no matter what rationale, argumentation
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.160]   they give, there is a finality to it.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.400]   Yes, the gospel is clear that God is an incredibly patient God, amen?
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.240]   But the fact of the matter is, we should dare never be so presumptuous to think that we
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.980]   could abuse that patience.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.360]   There is going to be a finality when God judges, when God decides that it is time and He closes
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.560]   the door, there is going to be no second request, there is going to be no pleading, pounding
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.480]   on the door and saying, "Oh, come on!"
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.200]   There's nothing like that.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.240]   And so there is a final judgment and it's going to be, according to this passage, devastating
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   and tragic.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.520]   Devastating and tragic.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.860]   It's almost as the picture of perhaps a prisoner standing with his face up against a chain-linked
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.260]   fence, wondering and only wishing.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.120]   And perhaps to the audience, there is an incredibly convicting point.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.300]   He says, "You're going to see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, whom you trusted to be your ticket
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.600]   into heaven, whom you thought automatically, 'I'm Abraham's child,' that you would get
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   in."
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.620]   There's going to be a rude, rude awakening.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.480]   Perhaps we might complain and say, "Oh, I didn't get a fair chance.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.060]   Come on, you gave that guy five chances."
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.600]   There is going to be none of that.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.020]   God's judgment is final.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.500]   By way of review, the points that I'm saying, all we're saying is there is a truth that
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.880]   Christ is telling us.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.140]   That this, what we're doing in the baptism, the decisions they have made, this is definitely
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.280]   not the same par as just doing some kind of preventative maintenance or a graduation to
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.520]   step up in their maturity.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.440]   I repeat the idea I began with.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.680]   There is a huge stark contrast between where they were and where they're headed.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.140]   There is a huge, huge divide.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.400]   There is going to be eternal agony where there's gnashing of teeth, or there's going to be
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.040]   an eternal joy with God in His presence.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.640]   And why am I talking about that?
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.820]   Because I want to make sure that the exhortation of Christ is received with the sobriety that
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.980]   He expects.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:19.840]   When He commanded in verse 24, "Strive to enter through the narrow door," I pray and
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.820]   hope that we do not hear that with, "Okay, sure, I'll try."
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.720]   With the urgency that He gives, the person simply asked the question, "Are there many
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.940]   people who are going to be saved, or is there just a few?"
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.280]   Do not dibble and dabble in just theology, but He is making a direct commandment, "No,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.040]   you need to make sure."
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:48.160]   And for those of you who are here, I want to make the same plea and exhortation to you.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:54.560]   If there is such a serious divide, you need to make sure.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.440]   If you go to the hospital to take a test on whether you have cancer, you cannot sit on
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.840]   that and say, "Well, I guess I'll take a look at it when I have time."
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.480]   You need to know.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.400]   If you understand that there are dire consequences here or there, you need to know.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.680]   And I need to know.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.400]   If you're a father, if you're a brother or a sister, if your child is in that hospital
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   room with a physician, and they're doing operation, and they're doing exam, whether that individual
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.160]   is going to live or die, you will want to know.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.320]   And in that same way, I want to challenge you.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.040]   When He says, "Strive," you need to know.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.960]   You need to know who God is.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.440]   Whether you believe He is a Creator or not, you need to know who Christ is, who is He,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.880]   what has He come to do.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.320]   You need to know where you stand in front of this God and in front of this Savior.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.620]   You need to know on which side you stand.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.840]   And that is the gospel that Jesus is saying to us.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.000]   You need to understand.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.600]   And perhaps if you didn't hear a gospel like this before, maybe you've received the kind
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.080]   of gospel where someone said, "Well, all you need to do, no matter where you are, just
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.440]   come as you are.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.880]   You don't have to change.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.580]   There's a free gift for you.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.360]   Just come and take it."
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.080]   I want to say to you, it is a free gift that God gives you.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.480]   Part of the reason why, although I said, "Yeah, this is more important than graduation.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.640]   This is more important than a wedding ceremony," then you might wonder, "Then why don't we
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   have a huge celebration?
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.440]   Why don't we parade you around and be like, 'Yeah, you did it!'"
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.600]   It's because there is a free grace and gift given to you where all you have to do is go
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.720]   through the door.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.840]   It's not based on your work, your track record, or anything that is meritorious to you.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:55.560]   However, the gospel that we receive and the urgency that we receive cannot be dissected
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.440]   from God Himself.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.040]   Where we think solely upon, "How do I come and how do I get this free gift?" without
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.720]   understanding what is God doing and who is He to us.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.680]   And therefore, this is what I would like to say as a last exhortation.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.600]   The amazing part of the gospel that we understand from this passage as well is, yes, there is
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:21.920]   this momentous, impetus call for us to see the urgency, to see the great divide and come
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.800]   and enter to that narrow door.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.520]   But the amazing truth, in verse 29, He says, "And they will come from the east and from
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.800]   the west, from the north and the south, and recline at the table of the kingdom of God.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:41.880]   And behold, some are last who will be first, and some who are first will become last."
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:47.200]   I want to say to you, the truth of the matter is, yes, the flock is small and the gate is
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   narrow.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.480]   And not every single person will be saved, which is an incredibly sobering reality.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:14:00.800]   But the grace of God is that although not everyone will be saved, anyone can be.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.960]   It doesn't matter if we're from the east, it doesn't matter if we're from the west,
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.240]   it doesn't matter if we're low, it doesn't matter if we're weak.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.800]   Should we be willing to come and heed the invitation of Christ?
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   The offer is there.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.840]   And He beseeches us, "Walk through this door."
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.560]   And therefore, the admonition is there for us.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.320]   Strive to enter.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.760]   And I want to make this call again, if you're here with us visiting, especially those of
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:36.360]   you who are family and friends, please don't see this as they are just simply maturing
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.960]   and they're getting spiritual.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.680]   They have made and heeded Christ's call to enter into His kingdom.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.600]   And the same offer is made to you.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.680]   And the same urgency is there for you.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.120]   You would need to come to this gate and when the Lord says, "Come through this narrow
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.400]   door," I pray that you would say, "Yes, I will."
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.760]   And if He says, "And you have to leave the baggage behind you," then you would say,
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   "Sure, gladly."
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.640]   Because you are the God of the universe.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.160]   You are the Savior.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.400]   So at this time, we're going to hear the testimony of how, for these brothers and sisters, God
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.480]   has led them to that point where they would come to Him, to come to repentance and faith.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.880]   Let's take a moment to pray for them as they come, and then we'll invite our first person
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.400]   to enter, to come to the pulpit to share their testimony.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:37.480]   Heavenly Father, we thank You so much that God, You warn and instruct us.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:44.280]   We are in our own state, deceived and fooled to think that we're okay, to think that we're
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.680]   safe in this life.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.120]   Lord, we thank You that You warn us.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.440]   Lord, there is judgment to come.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.800]   And time is of essence.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.680]   Lord, I ask that You would continue to just convict us of this truth and hear Your words
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:06.840]   of grace that You have said, "Whosoever would come, whosoever would repent and humble themselves,
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.640]   You would not turn away."
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.440]   We thank You, Lord, that You are such a gracious and merciful God.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.520]   We want to be encouraged and we want to glorify You in remembering all the stories and testimonies
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.360]   of the brothers and sisters now.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.000]   Would You grant to them boldness and strength?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.520]   And Lord, would You grant to them clarity as they speak?
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.560]   We thank You in Christ's name, amen.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   Amen.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.600]   Would you join with me in giving a warm welcome to our first sister, Kate Lee.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   Hello.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:41.160]   My name is Kate Lee, as Pastor Mark just mentioned, and I'm going to be getting baptized today.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.120]   So I'm getting baptized for two reasons.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:50.640]   Number one, I was sprinkled at the age of 15 at a Presbyterian church, but I can't say
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.080]   that I was a genuine believer at that time.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:59.200]   And number two, I was really blessed reading Colossians 2.12.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.760]   I'll read that right now.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.480]   Having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.040]   faith in the powerful working of God who raised Him from the dead.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:16.200]   So because of this verse, I wanted to partake in the physical representation of my new life
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.480]   that Christ brought upon in me.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.040]   Okay, so now I'm going to start my testimony.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:30.160]   Ironically, I gave my life to Jesus during my freshman year of college, which was 2011.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:36.840]   And I say ironic because it was the place I wanted all of my worldly dreams to come
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   true.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.160]   So growing up, I was severely ambitious.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.640]   I was really hungry for a worldly career.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.080]   I wanted to climb up the corporate ladder as soon as possible.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.560]   I like bluntly stated, I just wanted to be the best.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:59.880]   And I didn't want anyone getting in my way of my success.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   But all the more, I was having one foot in the world and one foot with God.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:14.080]   While pursuing these worldly goals, I wanted to still be a Christian and go to heaven.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.840]   And I wanted to be this rich, worldly, successful Christian because that's totally possible,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   right?
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   I see it all the time.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.640]   It's like, I don't know, I just thought it was normal.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.920]   But my dreams were crushed when I went to college.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.720]   And my pastor preached these crazy truths.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.760]   He said, if you want to be a disciple of Jesus, you have to take up the cross, surrender everything,
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.760]   and follow Him.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.880]   And yeah, I was so confused.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:50.160]   So if that wasn't crazy enough, he said, it is so hard for those who are rich to enter
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.800]   into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.840]   And I thought that was so strange because out of the five years that I grew up in youth
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.440]   group, I never heard words like that.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.560]   So I thought I was at a cult or something.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.160]   But I actually checked with the Bible and I found out that those were the words that
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.040]   Jesus actually said, and I couldn't argue with it.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:19.800]   And so I knew I wanted to love Jesus, and I know He died for me so that I can have eternal
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   life.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:28.680]   But I was really involved in my university, just working all the time, studying nonstop.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.720]   And I was super stressed and anxious with all the work I was doing.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.320]   Yeah, it was just, I was crazy.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:42.600]   But I knew I had to pick a side because it was so hard to live both lives.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.720]   As I mentioned, I had one foot in the world and one foot with God.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:54.000]   And the more and more I found out about the truth, I couldn't do both.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.720]   The two worlds were separating, and I knew at one point I had to pick a side.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:05.800]   And God was graciously revealing to me my pride and my lukewarm faith.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.880]   I began to realize I was extremely self-centered and prideful.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:15.000]   You know in Philippians, it says, "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit."
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.920]   I was doing everything from selfish ambition or conceit.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:28.400]   And I was also really convicted by the disciples in Matthew because when they met Jesus, they
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.440]   immediately, immediately left everything to follow Jesus.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:40.560]   They left their parents and they left their jobs, like their only source of income as
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.240]   fishermen to just be with Jesus.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:49.920]   And I knew that I had to surrender my career ambitions to seek Jesus because my pride was
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.520]   a hindrance to my faith and my ambitions were blinding me from seeing God.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.640]   So one thing after another, I slowly began giving things up, whether it was like certain
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:06.080]   activities or grades or like the way I studied, whatever it is.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:13.400]   And at every stage that I surrendered something, God met me so much more and began to show
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.360]   me the sweetness of his mercy and grace.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:25.000]   So through the word and grace of God, I began to genuinely hate my sins and weep over them.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.840]   And while I was seeing my sins, I was really depressed and broken.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:37.040]   But in light of seeing how great my sins were, I realized how much greater the crucifixion
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.000]   was that he actually died for me.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.400]   And all of what he did on the cross was to pay for our sins.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.760]   It was so awesome.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.640]   Sorry, I was looking for my place.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:58.520]   He died the death that I deserved and lived the life that I couldn't live so that I can
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.000]   be in union with him forever.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.120]   And to me, that was crazy.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:09.520]   And in response to understanding these truths, I knew I couldn't live my old life anymore.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.440]   And in light of seeing like how great this eternal life was, I didn't care to succeed
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:22.600]   in the world the way I wanted to, because God already gave me eternal life of fullest
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   joy.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.480]   And so I, yeah, God began to change me a lot throughout college.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   I wasn't as anxious over little things because I trusted him with the greatest thing.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.840]   It's kind of like the lesser to greater logic.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.720]   If God took care of the greatest thing, which is my eternal life, then it doesn't make sense
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.760]   for me to worry about little things like when my next paycheck is coming or where I'm going
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.800]   to go next or stuff like that.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.920]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.720]   It's just silly.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:59.760]   And as if that wasn't enough, he didn't just die for me and let me figure out the rest
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.600]   of my Christian life on my own.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.880]   But while pointing out my sins to me, he gave me grace to fight through them too.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.840]   So that's like the continual grace of God that I experienced throughout college.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.440]   And my entire character just began to change.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:21.480]   I grew like less bitter as he healed me of certain relationships.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:27.440]   And I actually wanted to love and care for other people and like love them.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.200]   And that was weird because I just cared about having like superficial friendships.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.540]   And as I mentioned, I grew a lot less anxious.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:42.720]   So though I had this nice university education, a well-built resume, and a highly coveted
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:49.320]   job offer at the end of college, it all seemed like complete rubbish in comparison to knowing
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.180]   Christ Jesus as my Lord.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.840]   And I was no longer suffocated by worldly standards.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:02.080]   I was no longer like hungry from pride and these like never-ending ambitions.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.360]   Everything just seems so meaningless.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.880]   Like they're all going to fade anyway.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.480]   I have eternal life.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.360]   Why does it matter?
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:15.600]   And yeah, in contrast, I was completely satisfied by God's presence and work in my life.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.640]   And I really did feel like a new creation.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.320]   So in lieu of all this, I didn't want to go back to my old life.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:29.240]   I was totally in love, head over heels, committed to Jesus from experiencing all of this.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.480]   And yes, it is a struggle.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:39.520]   I still see my sins over and over again, but I have experienced the fullness of God, God's
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:46.320]   presence and work in my life that I understand that obeying and abiding in Him is far greater
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.000]   than the temporary satisfaction of sin.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.520]   So because of all that Christ has done for me, my life was His.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:59.480]   That's the only natural response that I could have for understanding the truth.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:05.760]   And it was no longer under my control in the anxious way that I wanted to plan my whole
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:12.120]   life and my future, but I just wanted to give up my whole life to God.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.400]   And again, like as in response, I wanted God to do whatever He wanted or needed with my
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.900]   life, wherever He wanted me to go.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:28.080]   So I surrendered this pretty little American dream I had of my life and let God write my
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.320]   story.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:35.840]   So by the grace of God, out of college, I rejected this job offer that I really wanted.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:42.280]   And I spent a year just serving in my college ministry and just working part-time to make
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.680]   ends meet and just discipling girls, like teaching the word.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.760]   It was just so awesome.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.920]   And then, if that's not crazy enough, God led me to go to Japan for two years to teach
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.160]   the word to Japanese children who've never heard the gospel before.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:05.880]   And I don't have time to tell you my testimony of Japan, but it was some of the hardest years
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:13.880]   of my life, but also where I felt and experienced God's greatest intimacy.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.880]   So pretty much...
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.060]   Oh, actually.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.960]   So now I'm here getting my teaching credential, which is totally unexpected of what I wanted
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.240]   to do five years ago.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:30.120]   And God radically changed my life, and I've never been so joyful and full of life since.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.280]   So that's my testimony, and I'm so thankful that I got to share it.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:42.120]   And I hope that as I shared it, you all can keep me accountable in case, for some reason,
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.920]   I want to run away and someone in here has to rebuke me and bring me back.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920]   So thank you.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   If you understand that when you go into the water, you're united with Christ and his death,
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   and then when you come out, you're united with Christ and his resurrected life?
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.760]   Hi, my name's Anthony.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.200]   I'm a first year in college, and this is my testimony.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.920]   So like most people, I was born and raised in a church and went to Sunday school every
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   week.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.720]   As a kid, I grew up being very anxious and never really had any friends within the church.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.400]   And because of this, I was just constantly afraid of talking to people.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.520]   I never really understood why we went to church and hated going for the most part.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.000]   I didn't understand sin.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.880]   I didn't understand who God was.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.320]   And I didn't understand what any of that had to do with me.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.960]   The next few years into my junior high, my home church relocated, and I stopped attending
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.240]   Sunday school.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.080]   And in this time, while I was still surrounded by a Christian environment, it was the beginning
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.680]   of my distance away from God.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.240]   Fast forward a few years to when I was a sophomore in high school.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.920]   I was super stressed about an Algebra 2 test I had the next day, and I was as moody and
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.480]   anxious as a teenager can be.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.520]   And for reasons I can't exactly remember, I got into the biggest fight of my life with
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.520]   my mom.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.720]   There was yelling, slamming tables, and words that shouldn't have been said.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.960]   I was so mad that I had every intention of hurting my mother, and specifically remember
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.920]   the words that came out of my mouth.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.440]   I said, "It's because of you I don't go to church anymore."
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.920]   And while I myself was frozen in that moment about how much my anger took over me, I'm
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.840]   sure as a mother, there was almost nothing more heartbreaking you can ever hear from
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.280]   your own son.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.080]   The next day, I actually ended up failing the Algebra 2 test.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.680]   But more importantly, the fight I had with my mom made me really evaluate what I was
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   doing with my life.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.760]   I was conflicted about how I grew up in a Christian household, yet wanting to have nothing
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.880]   to do with God, and knew I had to make a decision in how I lived my life.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.640]   I'm ashamed to say that that day, I ended up making the mental decision to cut off any
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.800]   ties I had with God and with church.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.400]   And to be honest, for a while, I felt burden-free and content with my life.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   There was no more worry, no more guilt, and no more shame.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.200]   The thing was that my whole life, even as I got older, I started to learn about science
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.080]   and evolution in science class.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.840]   I always believed that there was God.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.360]   I just didn't care.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.720]   To a certain extent, I knew I was going to hell, but none of that really mattered to
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.280]   me.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.720]   And in this period of time, my apathy turned into bitterness, which eventually turned into
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.680]   a season of hatred towards God.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.400]   The next year, when I was a junior in high school, I had the biggest crush on a girl
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   that I thought I could be potentially in love with.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.360]   Long story short, I was rejected.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.120]   I idolized this girl so much that my emotional state was at its all-time low.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.200]   It was my first ever broken heart that lasted almost two years to the middle of my senior
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.960]   year, the same time all the other seniors were stressed because of college.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.120]   In that time, the culmination of anxieties about the future and my still-broken heart
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.880]   made me desperate to find answers and happiness from somewhere.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.240]   Later on, as the guilt of not having touched my Bible in so long began to grow, I had a
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.160]   friend who coincidentally asked me to come out to his church.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:17.000]   I was curious about what they had to say and initially just went to clear my conscience.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.040]   As I continued to come out for a while, I don't remember the messages, but it caused
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.640]   me to contemplate about what my purpose in life is and the relevance of God in it.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.680]   But in the end, I still felt empty and stubborn to admit that God can mend my heart.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.720]   Within the next few months, two very prominent people came into my life.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.160]   One of them, ironically, was my big sister, who loved me unconditionally until the birth
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.980]   of my life.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.480]   The other was my new brother-in-law, who somehow convinced me and brought me out to my first
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.440]   ever Berean College Bible study.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.880]   In this time, I was still broken from the past and anxious about the future and life
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.960]   in general, but when I saw them get married, it was my first exposure to clearly seeing
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:01.800]   God's love and sovereignty shine through that left me in awe.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.440]   Through them, it was the first time in my life where I ever heard the gospel and truly
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.960]   believed that I was a sinner.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.840]   When I first came to Berean, I honestly thought I was a Christian because of how I was raised,
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.760]   but also struggled with the thoughts that I had already gone too far down the road of
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.920]   sin to be forgiven.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:22.640]   I was anxious more than ever due to the new environment, but as I kept attending, my grief
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:28.120]   towards my own sin began to grow as I started to learn about God's forgiving character.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.040]   Even now, I honestly still don't completely understand His mercy and how He could ever
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:38.880]   forgive someone like me, a sinner, who neglected Him multiple times throughout his life.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.200]   After I truly repented for the first time in my life and declared God as my Lord and
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.880]   Savior, I found comfort knowing that He knew how lost and empty I was, even after my season
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.640]   of hatred, that He never changed and sent His Son to die on the cross to atone for my
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.640]   sins.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:57.080]   I admitted my weakness and my utmost dependency on Him and started to see how He sovereignly
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.480]   orchestrated my life from the beginning to where I am now by transforming my sinful heart
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   of stone.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:07.760]   By God's grace alone, He has saved me from my sin and is the reason why I am here today.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.880]   Lastly, I would just like to share Romans 6, 17-18.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.840]   But thanks be to God that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.880]   heart to the standard of teaching to which you are committed, and having been set free
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.320]   from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.320]   Thank you.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:29.520]   I think you understand when you're going into the water, you're uniting with Christ in His
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.520]   death, and then when you come out of the water, you're uniting with life.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.760]   Hello, everyone.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.680]   My name is Nicole, and I'm currently part of the Berean Adult Ministry, and I'm here
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.080]   to share with you all God's saving work in my life.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.840]   Sorry.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.280]   Okay.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.520]   Sorry.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.680]   Okay.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:15.400]   I grew up attending a Christian church where I learned about God, Jesus, numerous Bible
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.600]   stories, and what I needed to believe to go to heaven.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.880]   I actively participated in church at my home church, volunteering in the children's ministry,
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.680]   getting baptized in ninth grade, attending endless prayer meetings, going on overseas
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.520]   missions, and participating in almost every conference and retreat.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.760]   I loved going to church, and church was where I felt most comfortable and where I had met
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.360]   my closest friends.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.120]   I, with many others around me, thought that I was a good Christian.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.000]   Yet in the midst of it all, I didn't know who God was or what the gospel was, more so
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.440]   what the gospel is to me personally.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.360]   I didn't have the need for a savior because although I knew and even stated I'm a sinner,
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.280]   I didn't really see myself as a sinner.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.080]   Though I would not voice out my thoughts, I was comparing myself with others, thinking
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.960]   I was good because I didn't do "bad things" and failed to see the sins in my own heart,
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.720]   namely my unbelief and rebellion towards God, and the desire for self which was reflected
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.880]   in the way I was at home or wherever I didn't feel the need to appear good.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.280]   "I am a sinner" was one of the points I needed to believe to go to heaven.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.120]   I sought out God because I didn't want to go to hell, not because I saw my sins as sinful
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.240]   and needed Christ to cleanse me from my sins.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.480]   As a young child, whenever I would question whether I was saved or not, I would assure
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.440]   myself with the fact that I've prayed or I've done Christian works.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.920]   I also relied on how others thought of me to assure myself of my salvation.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:46.040]   My goal was to go to heaven, and I was doing what I thought I could to get there.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.640]   My view of God was also wrong.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.840]   I saw God as one loving and forgiving, but His holiness and justice was something I didn't
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.000]   consider or understand.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.980]   With this wrong, one-sided view of God, I took God's grace for granted, sinning and
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:01.000]   consoling myself that God's grace forgives me.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.960]   I had the form of religion but was self-righteous and self-seeking, pursuing what pleases my
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.840]   flesh and was not a Christian.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.440]   What happened?
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.200]   God revealed the gospel to me through a variety of avenues.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.640]   During the summer after I graduated high school, I randomly came across a gospel YouTube clip
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.400]   where the preacher used God's law to first help the hearer recognize their need of a
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.200]   Savior and then share Christ's work on the cross.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.080]   Initially, I watched it, wanting to learn how I can share with others, but one night,
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.560]   I began reflecting on myself and realized I was in the same sinful state, but I had
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.560]   not understood it before.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.640]   That's when I first really understood that I was not good and therefore I needed Jesus.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:44.240]   Secondly, a college staff member at my home church led a verse-by-verse study of Romans
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.160]   where I saw how holy and loving God was, and the gospel became very clear that God in His
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.400]   holiness demanded justice for sin, that I deserved His just wrath, yet He showed His
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.280]   love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.560]   I was humbled, realizing that I was relying on my works for salvation.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.280]   Furthermore, I started attending Burien's college Bible study where I was made to reflect
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.440]   on whether I loved Christ or simply the things of Christ.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.600]   By God's grace, I recognized I am a sinner in need of a Savior, and near the end of college,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.200]   in the privateness of my own room, I came to God in repentance of my sins and received
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.600]   Jesus as my Lord and Savior.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.200]   Throughout the period of recognizing these truths about God, the gospel, and myself,
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.360]   I went through numerous doubts about whether I was saved.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.960]   I knew I wasn't a Christian previously, and I didn't want to make that same mistake again.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.920]   Through these moments of doubts, God in His mercy helped me see that it is by Christ's
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:46.460]   death and resurrection that I am cleansed completely from my sins and that I can approach
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:51.960]   God not because I've done X amount of works, but by faith in Christ and in His work alone.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.440]   I am thankful to God because I know that it is God who has begun His work in me and He
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.880]   will bring it to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.600]   I thank God for not leaving me in my condemned state where I was presuming that I was a Christian
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.760]   because I've done the Christian things and had knowledge of the Bible, but instead shown
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.960]   me mercy by revealing Himself and the gospel through His word.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.600]   I thank God for changing my heart.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.240]   Before I viewed obedience as an obligation, but now I desire to obey God.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.760]   Before I simply loved the things of Christ, but now I desire Christ and His ways.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.560]   May all glory and praise be to God who sent His only Son Jesus to save me from my sins
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.200]   and for being the author and perfecter of my faith.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   Thank you.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.140]   You understand that when you go into the water, you're united with Christ in His death, and
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.640]   when you come out, you're united with Christ in His resurrected life.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.640]   Amen.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:57.480]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.680]   Hello.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.000]   My name is Jonathan, and this is my testimony.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.720]   All my life, I've grown up in church surrounded by an immense amount of Christian influence.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.440]   Having much of my family heavily involved, I learned at a very young age that church
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.760]   is important and we need to go every week so we can learn about Jesus.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:20.760]   However, even though I had an idea of Christianity and that I needed to obey God in order for
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.960]   me to please Him, my life didn't necessarily reflect this.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.160]   Aside from church, I rarely acknowledged God in my life and focused on pleasing myself,
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.480]   whether it would be playing with my friends or whining to my parents so I could get what
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.760]   I wanted.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.160]   Only at church or when my parents would read me the Bible would I actually think about
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.600]   God.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.360]   Many things that I was taught never really stayed in my mind and would go through one
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.360]   ear and not the other.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.520]   In fourth grade, I began to start cussing at school with my friends, separating my church
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.760]   life with school life even more.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.520]   It was during this time where God began to reveal my sin and that I needed to repent
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.160]   and ask for forgiveness.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.600]   I remember feeling anxious and full of guilt as I didn't really understand God's forgiveness
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.320]   and felt that I somehow needed to make up for my sin.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.040]   Despite my tendency to keep things to myself and not expose my sins, my convictions drove
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.760]   me to reveal them to my mom and tell her of my profanity.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.000]   During this time, she must have shared the gospel.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.440]   I don't remember exactly what she said, but I remember feeling an extreme amount of relief
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.640]   as I realized that Jesus came down to die for me in order to take away my sin.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.840]   I can lay all my burdens on Him because He has already paid for that on the cross and
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.360]   there's nothing I can do to earn His favor.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.680]   In Isaiah 118, it says, "Come now, let us reason together," says the Lord.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.920]   "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be white as snow.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.320]   Though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool."
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.720]   From then on, I felt a huge burden lifted.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.240]   I prayed to God as long as I could remember, but it was probably around this time that
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:52.120]   I prayed with saving faith and began to actually seek a personal relationship with God.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.540]   I read His word every day and had a desire to please God in everything I did.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.280]   I can definitely say that my relationship with God was not perfect after this moment.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.360]   There has been countless times where I've sinned against Him, causing me to question
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.440]   my faith and whether or not I am really saved.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.640]   In my life, I've sinned over and over again, and after each time, I sometimes struggle
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.080]   to humble myself before God and repent for the same sin that I have done before as I
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.040]   feel a sense of guilt and unworthiness for God's forgiveness again.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.440]   How can He forgive me when I just committed that sin yesterday?
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.760]   However, God is gracious and merciful and He has already paid for my sins today and
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.400]   for the rest of my life.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.760]   Hebrews 10.22 says, "Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.920]   assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.280]   and having our bodies washed with pure water."
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.760]   I know that this doesn't mean that I shouldn't care about my sins anymore, as there should
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.480]   be a sense of guilt that the Holy Spirit instills in me.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.240]   It is the Almighty God who I am sinning against after all.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.760]   However, God has taught me that my relationship with Him should not be defined by this guilt,
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.760]   but should be defined by gratitude because I know that Jesus has freed me from my sins.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.200]   Although there are times when I can't help but feel sorrowful, the guilt leads me to
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.400]   repentance as I don't want my sins to hinder my love for Him.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:08.000]   In response, I not only have peace in my heart, but as I continue to live my life, I have
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.560]   a desire to know about this gracious God who has saved me, a disgraceful sinner, and called
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.880]   me His son.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.320]   Reading God's Word and having a strong relationship with Him helps me to fight against my sins
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.980]   as I try to acknowledge God in all my actions.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:25.120]   I know that I will never be perfect, but because I am grateful for what Jesus has done, it
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.360]   causes me to desire to please God and live my life for Him.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:34.000]   As it says in 2 Corinthians 5, 14-15, "For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.160]   that one died for all, and therefore all died.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.280]   And He died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.880]   who died for them and was raised again."
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   Thank you.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   Just to explain, this is his father.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.280]   He's not some stranger just taking over.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.280]   He's one of the elders of our church, and I asked him to come and help.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:02.720]   I know Jonathan and Faith, they've been members here longer than 99% of our church.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   I know that many of you invested in them, prayed for them, and you probably can't believe
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:12.280]   how old you are seeing how old they are, and standing here giving their testimony.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.400]   I know a lot of you guys invested your time and energy, so we're very thankful for all
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:21.080]   the teachers, all the Sunday school teachers, and especially the youth group teachers who've
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:26.520]   been investing in them, but especially the parents, and obviously the father and mother
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.920]   who've invested and prayed for them for so many years.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.760]   That's why I asked Elder Philip to come, and he's going to help out with the baptism.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.760]   Okay?
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:40.000]   Jonathan, do you understand when you go into the water, you're united with Christ in His
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.040]   death, and when you come out of the water, you're united with His resurrected life?
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:43:01.160]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.160]   Hi.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.280]   My name is Faith.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:11.880]   I'm a sophomore in high school, and this is my testimony.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.840]   Being a pastor's kid kind of meant going to church regularly every Sunday, and then attending
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.960]   Wednesday Bible studies during the week.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:26.600]   And then during Sunday school, I knew all the questions, or the answers to all the questions
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.840]   asked about the Bible story that we were taught that day.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.400]   And then I prayed, and I gave a dollar for offering every week.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:41.160]   And I memorized all of my memory verses and sang all the songs, and I prayed for offering
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   when it was my turn.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:51.800]   And in Sunday school and in regular days, I guess, I was a good kid.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:59.280]   I didn't really get in trouble that often, and I usually listened right away, especially
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:04.440]   in Sunday school, because my mom was the teacher back then.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.120]   And then, yeah, so overall, I was a good kid.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.960]   But even though I went to church and I learned about God, I didn't really understand why
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.080]   I went to church or why I was learning about God.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:21.800]   I just did it because I had to and because my parents were Christian.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.160]   And then when I went to youth group, I felt like everything, like all the stories that
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.880]   I had learned about in the Bible had changed, and they became for older people.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.640]   And so I couldn't understand what I was learning on Sundays.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:45.240]   But then, yeah, so then I couldn't understand all the sermons Pastor Mark was teaching.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.960]   And then because of that, I couldn't answer the questions in small group, and so I was
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.520]   always kind of quiet, I guess.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:01.400]   And then a little bit after I joined youth group, I started understanding, and I started
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.000]   questioning why I went to church and why I believed God.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.360]   And then in eighth grade, I kind of figured out all the answers to my questions, but I
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.720]   still wasn't really sure why I believed God was real.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:22.680]   And then, so like I said before, I was a pretty good kid, and I didn't really get in trouble.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:29.720]   But then at the end of eighth grade, in the beginning of ninth grade, there was a lie
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.920]   I had told to my parents, and it stretched out for a while.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.720]   And they found out, and then I got in trouble, obviously.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:43.560]   But then even though I got in trouble, I asked for forgiveness, and they forgave me right
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.560]   away.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:50.160]   And so I don't know why, but it was just so amazing to me that my parents could forgive
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:56.640]   me right away, even though I had committed what seemed to me like a big sin.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.800]   And then so that caused me to think, if my parents could forgive me right away for something
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.600]   that seemed so big to me, how could God forgive me of all my sins that I committed and will
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.320]   commit, and even more, that he would send his son to die for me?
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:15.640]   So that was my life-changing story.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:23.200]   But then that night, I prayed to God and asked him to forgive me, and then I accepted Christ
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   as my Lord and Savior.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:35.080]   And then I also prayed with my parents, and I had a big talk with them about lying.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:42.080]   And so in the youth group, we got to memorize Philippians 2, 5-13, but verses 5-8 really
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.560]   stood out to me.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.600]   Have this mind among yourself, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.160]   form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:47:15.280]   taking on the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of man, and being found in
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.400]   human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   on the cross.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.080]   So even now, I still don't have answers to all my questions, but I have the answer to
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.240]   the most important question.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:33.400]   I know who God is to me, and I know what he means to me, and I'm saved by grace and grace
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.560]   alone, and through God's grace, I'm able to have a relationship with him.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:43.160]   So I have faith that I will grow more in my knowledge with him, and my relationship with
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.160]   him will make it stronger.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.440]   Even though I sin constantly, I know I have faith that God will always be there, and I'll
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.640]   always be able to turn to him whenever I need to.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.640]   Thank you.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   Do you understand when you go into the water, you're united with Christ in his death, and
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   you come out, you're united with Christ in his resurrected life?
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:18.640]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.680]   Hey, everyone.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.680]   My name's Angelo.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.160]   I'm a first year at UCI, and this is my testimony.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.800]   I did not grow up in a Christian household.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.640]   I started going to a church in the seventh grade, and there I was introduced to the gospel.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.600]   At that time, I believed I accepted Christ, but now if I were to look back at my life,
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.800]   I do not believe I was saved because of my understanding of the gospel was incomplete.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.000]   I essentially proclaimed to accept Christ because I feared hell, and I thought that
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.120]   was the end of my Christian faith.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.400]   When I started high school, I started going to my current home church.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.440]   There, my view of God expanded.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.720]   I learned that although God is wrathful, he is also loving and merciful.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.760]   Through church services, youth group, and interactions with the church community, I
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.760]   had a better understanding of what it meant to worship a God that loves.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:08.400]   However, my understanding of God was still very shallow.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.160]   The context of most of my prayers would just be me asking God for his blessings.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.120]   Essentially, I still live for the things of the world, and I thought God was a tool to
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.000]   help me get about life easier.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.960]   I believed in a loving and merciful God, but did not truly understand what it meant to
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.720]   declare him as Lord over my life.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.960]   Around my junior year of high school, I entered a season of apathy towards my faith.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.480]   I was rarely convicted for messages on Sunday services or Friday night youth group.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:38.880]   I felt like I've already heard every sermon, and I did not find much value in reading scripture.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:43.320]   I was overwhelmed by responsibilities as a student preparing for standardized testing.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.200]   I was physically and mentally drained with daily volleyball practices.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.560]   Being at home also added to the overall stress level I had because of family issues and pressure
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.080]   to do well in school.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.720]   Overall, God has stripped everything away from me.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.920]   During this time, it was during this time that I realized that following the course
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.120]   of this world had no value.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:07.240]   I eventually approached God in prayer, confessing my pursuit for glory and worldly success.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:12.720]   I put my faith in God, trusting that despite whatever unfortunate circumstances I was in,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:16.040]   that God was still somehow a God of love.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.400]   One of the major things I declared God's lordship over was my volleyball career.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.560]   Throughout high school, I invested so much time and energy in volleyball.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.520]   After I repented over my sins and truly accepted Christ, I had a change of attitude through
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.720]   the way I played volleyball.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.180]   Despite being the captain of my volleyball team my senior year, I no longer cared as
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:39.640]   much about my performance, but instead I cared about the message I would be sending to my
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.240]   teammates through the way I played volleyball.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.840]   Ultimately, I found less value in the competitive aspect of volleyball and more value in showing
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.760]   sportsmanship and encouraging team unity.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.800]   As my last year of high school ended, I wanted to grow in faith, but I did not know how to.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.000]   Despite accepting Christ, I felt that my view of God was still so small.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.320]   I knew that something was wrong with me, feeling like I've heard every sermon before.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.040]   So all I really knew how to do was pray for God to reveal himself to me.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.800]   During my first week of college, I came to Berrien.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.720]   When I arrived, I remember feeling so welcome.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.600]   I realized that everyone's eagerness to get to know me, to ask about my name, my major,
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:23.200]   where I'm from, was all rooted in their love for Christ and their desire to get collegians
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.880]   rooted in a church.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.480]   I wanted to develop this great love for Christ that I saw through my brothers and sisters
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   at Berrien.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.680]   Eventually, I discovered that the core of this faith that I saw through the community
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.320]   at Berrien was founded by scripture.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.360]   As time went on, I was constantly enlightened and convicted by the expository preaching
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:46.160]   at Berrien and recognized the richness of God that can be revealed through scripture.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.560]   In response, I decided to root myself in Berrien and even in my own time, I would study scripture,
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.440]   which was something I never truly found value in, in the past.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.120]   Overall, God has been merciful to reveal his worthiness to me through his living word and
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:04.600]   work of the spirit, which is why I can joyfully proclaim my identification with his death
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   and resurrection today.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.600]   Thank you.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:07.600]   So you understand when you're going into the water, you're united with Christ in his death,
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   and when you come out, you're united with his resurrected life.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:35.120]   Hi, my name is Jennifer, and I'm currently a fourth year at UCI.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.200]   Ever since I was young, I grew up attending church with my family.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:43.440]   I was baptized when I was 10 years old, but I did not understand the totality of the gospel,
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.280]   the way in my sins, and who God was until I came to college.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:52.240]   Growing up, I thought sin was external acts like deceit, cheating, stealing, and murder.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.520]   I thought only pastors read the Bible.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.920]   I prayed to God as if he was a genie.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.480]   I never really paid attention to a sermon, and I focused on having good Christian morals
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.320]   to identify myself as a Christian.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.320]   Because I thought sin was only an external act, I was blind to other sins of the heart,
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:14.040]   such as pride, selfishness, fairness, and overall ungodliness that tore apart my relationships
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.440]   with my family.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:19.600]   I lived my life as my own God, desiring my own glory.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.360]   Psalms 53 says, "The fool says in his heart there is no God.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.960]   They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good."
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.240]   I was blinded and indifferent to what sin was, and had a skewed view of God.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:37.200]   My identity was rooted in the world's standards and expectations of getting good grades, going
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.080]   to college, and being successful.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.600]   When I left to start college, I knew I wanted to join a Christian fellowship and find a
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.680]   church to attend, not to grow my love for God, but for Christian friends who had similar
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.280]   values as me.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.720]   In the first couple weeks of fall quarter of my freshman year, a few sisters and I talked
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.560]   a lot about God.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:59.480]   Specifically, they would talk about wanting to grow in the faith, and because I didn't
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.560]   want to seem off and awkward, I said, "Me too."
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:07.720]   But in my head, I was thinking, "Oh my gosh, these girls are those extreme crazy Christians,
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.840]   and what does growing in your faith even mean?"
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:15.200]   Around this time, I also started attending Brain and CCM, which is a Christian campus
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.080]   ministry in Irvine.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.960]   And when I began to actually listen to sermons and read God's word, God opened my eyes and
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:26.040]   humbled my heart and heart by revealing to me the seriousness of sin in my life, and
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:28.000]   the hatred God had for sin.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   And it was so deeply rooted in my heart, and that I was in rebellion against God every
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   single day.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.480]   There was nothing I could do to save myself, but God is so faithful and merciful to an
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.960]   undeserving sinner like me, for sending his son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross and
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:47.440]   bear my sins, and three days later, resurrect so that I can be forgiven of my sins and receive
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.960]   his amazing gift of salvation.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:56.200]   As it says in Ephesians 2, 4-5, "But God being rich in mercy, and because of the great
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:01.160]   love with which he loved us, made us alive together with Christ, by grace you have been
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.160]   saved."
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.240]   Knowing this truth and the weight of my sins, I repented, asking God for forgiveness of
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:08.920]   my sins, which drew me further away from him, and asked that he would reign in my heart
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.840]   and be Lord over my life.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:14.760]   Knowing Christ's love and recognizing my sin for heart, opened my eyes to see my pride
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.080]   of sin and lack of love towards my parents.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:22.240]   I was humble in desire to seek reconciliation and reflect Christ's love to them.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.200]   From freshman year until now, God has grown my faith, love, and obedience to him through
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.120]   the reading of his word and through prayer.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:32.320]   He challenges me to trust and depend on him in every circumstance, reminding me that my
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.720]   identity is ultimately founded upon Christ.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:40.280]   He continues to reveal sins to me that I was once blinded to, and would never consider
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.760]   to be sinned, because I rationalized that they were part of my personality.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:49.640]   For example, I tend to be a very anxious person, whether it be about grades, driving, my financial
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.840]   situation, and the future in general.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.040]   There are many times I was consumed by these thoughts during the day and lost sleep over
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.400]   them.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.080]   Even though anxiety may not seem serious in my eyes, God continues to remind me that it
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.720]   is a sin and it is serious in his eyes.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:09.200]   My anxiety represents a lack of trust in God and his sovereignty over my life.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:13.200]   In times of anxiety, I had to surrender all these thoughts to God, but continually repent
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.040]   of them and ask God to grow my trust in him, knowing that I am weak.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:21.840]   I can confidently say that he is good, sovereign, and true peace is only found in him.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.880]   Colossians 3, 1-3 says, "If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:29.160]   above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:33.200]   Set your mind on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.960]   For you have died and your life is ending with Christ and God."
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.560]   Throughout the past few years, I have been constantly humbled and reminded to surrender
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.920]   my whole life to him, seeking to exalt him in everything.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:49.400]   Although I repeatedly sin and fail, I am eternally grateful for his mercy and grace
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:55.600]   that allows me to persevere and seek to give glory to him in all that I do.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   Do you understand that when you go into the water, you're united with Christ in his death?
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.600]   When you come out, you're united with his resurrected life?
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.600]   Alright, hello.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   My name is John Choi.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.600]   I'm currently in BAM.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   I was raised in a Christian family and both my parents were pastor kids.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.600]   I have one older brother, Chris Choi.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:27.600]   He also goes to Brigham, you guys may know.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   So, because I was raised in a Christian family, I would go to church every Sunday.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   And during those Sunday services, I would hear, "All you need to do is believe that
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   Jesus Christ died for your sins and you are saved."
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   So as a kid, that meant I could do whatever I wanted as long as I believed in Jesus.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   So in high school, I would party after my football games and go to church on Sundays.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   I would have no remorse for my sins.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   I thought I was good because compared to my other friends, I went to church on Sundays.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   This Adrian mindset carried over to college.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   I went to Irvine Valley College for two years and transferred to Davis.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:03.600]   But during my time at IBC, I went to Bruin for one year, but I honestly hated it because
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.600]   I thought it was a bunch of Pharisees who never struggled with sin.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:12.600]   They did not fit the mold of what I thought a Christian looked like.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.600]   My thought of a Christian was, "It's okay to sin because you have Jesus."
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.600]   I thought everyone in Bruin were faking it and just wearing masks.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.600]   I changed ministries and went to a ministry that fit my criteria of Christianity.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.600]   I found friends that were okay with partying and going to church.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   We would party together on weekends and go to church.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   We would routinely arrive late to church every Sunday.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:36.600]   So my heart was not there in worship and it was honestly just a checkbox off my list.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   I transferred to Davis where I found a place in the middle of nowhere and knew no one.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.600]   But honestly, this was a blessing in disguise.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.600]   My first week there, I had one of those broken down moments.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   After coming home from a fraternity party, I broke down and asked myself, "What am I doing?
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.600]   Is this how my mother raised me?"
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   I went down on my knees and I cried out to God to help me.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.600]   I took my faith more seriously. I served in my church.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   I went to overseas missions and served as a small group leader.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   So transformation started to happen.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.600]   However, I noticed that I was still involved with drinking with my friends.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   I felt like my life was no different than a non-Christian.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   I realized there were certain sins that I could not escape.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   So after I graduated, I noticed that my friends that I served with and drank with stopped going to church.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   And that's when I moved down to San Diego and told myself, "I have to go to church."
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   So I did find a church and during my time in San Diego, I was just a Sunday churchgoer and didn't really serve.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:35.600]   I just went back to partying and sometimes even instigating house parties on weekends.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   After San Diego, however, I got a new job in Orange County.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   And before I moved, I told myself I wanted to find a church that would keep me accountable.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.600]   I did not care about fellowship or hanging out with people that had my same interests.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.600]   I wanted to find a church that knew the truth and preached the truth.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   I knew that brand from freshman year, so I decided to go here.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   I will listen to sermons about this post-Christian world that we live in.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   How we live in a world that cheapens grace.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.600]   Sermons about nominal Christians or being cultured in the church.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.600]   Also sermons on what a real Christian looks like as well.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.600]   It's not just saying, "I believe in Jesus Christ and I'll be saved."
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.600]   It's more than that.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.600]   If you are truly saved, you have to separate yourself from the world.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   You cannot love the worldly things and love God.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   I evaluated myself and I realized I met the criteria of a nominal Christian
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   or a Christian that has been cultured in the church.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.600]   It took me almost half my life to realize it, but I'm blessed that God revealed it to me at this time.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   It's a scary thought because all your life you think that you're a Christian, but you're really not.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   With how much I have sinned and how many times I've cheapened His grace,
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   He could have easily kept me blinded of my iniquities.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.600]   Instead, He showed me grace and mercy upon me and showed me the truth and the light
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.600]   of what it means to pick up the cross and follow Him.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   I thank Him for not leaving me during those times in college when I had no heart for worship.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   He tugged onto my heart little by little.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:01.600]   He gave me a conscience and made me question myself and my faith.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.600]   God showed me so much patience and grace in my life and it makes me want to do the same for others.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.600]   So as I get baptized today, I am professing that God is Lord over my life
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   and I will no longer live with the world, but live for Christ and Jesus Christ only.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   God bless and thank you.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.600]   You understand when you're going into the water, you're united with Christ's death
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.600]   and when you come out, you're united with His resurrected life?
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.600]   Yes.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.600]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   [water splashing]
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.840]   (applause)
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.900]   you
