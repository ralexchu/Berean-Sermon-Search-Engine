[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.400]   - All right, good morning.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.400]   Let me get to a few announcements.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   Again, as you guys know, we have Passion Week this week,
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   and so please take as many as you need
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   to pass out and invite people
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.400]   and maybe even begin the conversation.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.400]   As you guys know, starting from tomorrow,
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   every day we have a devotional
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   starting from Monday through--
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.400]   even Thursday and Friday.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   So the devotionals Monday through Wednesday
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   is happening at 7:30 p.m.,
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.400]   so I encourage you to come a little bit early
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   to find parking.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.400]   We have certain parking, obviously,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   during the weekday that are only available
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   during the weekday in certain spots,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   so there's places--
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.400]   if you're not used to coming here on the weekdays,
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   the parking spots that we have on Sunday
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   is not always available, so the parking behind us--
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   we will have it on Friday.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.400]   We have separate additional parking on Friday,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.400]   but weekdays we have this lot, our lot,
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.400]   across the street, and then there will be shuttle
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   going around, but behind the lot
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.400]   and some of the other lots are not available
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   during the weekdays, so just keep that in mind.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   Just try to come a little bit earlier.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   We're going to start right at 7:30,
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.400]   and the devotional and the sharing time
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   is most likely going to last about an hour,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   so just keep that in mind.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   And then the Passover meal,
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.400]   that one's starting at 6:30, okay?
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   And it's because it's a meal,
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   so if you start at 7:30,
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   it might be a little bit too late,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.400]   so that's happening at 6:30 this coming Thursday.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   So I'm told that there's a little bit more room
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   if you want to still come to that.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.400]   That's happening this Thursday,
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.400]   and then obviously Good Friday at 7:30.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.400]   So Good Friday, we have ample parking,
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.400]   but we are expecting over seven,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.400]   possibly even 800 people,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.400]   so that's more than any given Sundays,
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.400]   because we have three services.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   We are spread out, and we typically have
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.400]   a lot of guests that come.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   So I encourage you to come a little bit earlier.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   We are going to be having overflow.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   This room obviously is not going to fit
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   all the people that are going to come,
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   so the cafe area is going to be set up like here.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   So the communion that we will have on Friday
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   will also be taking place in that area,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   and then the area where the youth group meets,
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   that's going to be reserved for family
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   with small children, okay?
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   So if you've ever been here on Friday
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   during the Good Friday service,
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.400]   you know how packed it is.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   So it's going to be every single seat here
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.400]   and over there is going to be pretty much packed.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.400]   And so, again, we encourage you
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.400]   to come a little bit earlier.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.400]   We have plenty of parking,
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   but you're going to have to look online,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   or when you get here, we'll have attendants
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.400]   kind of guide you and lead you to the proper parking.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   So that's happening this week,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   and obviously on Sunday we have
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   early rise service at 6,
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   and then right afterwards
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   there's going to be light breakfast provided
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   so that you don't have to go out
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   like we used to before
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   because our service starts at 8 o'clock,
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   and there will be lunch provided
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   after the second and third service
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   if you are there for that, okay?
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.400]   All right, so there's a lot going on this week,
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:03.400]   and I'll explain a little bit more later.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   There's a membership class
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   that is starting another session on April 21st,
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   so if you need to sign up for that,
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.400]   please sign up for that.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.400]   And then the service auction,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   the fundraiser for our summer missions to Korea,
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.400]   the last day to sign up for that is April 6th,
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   so you only have a couple more weeks
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   to sign up for that.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   And then the actual auction itself
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   is going to be taking place
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.400]   on the 21st to the 27th of April, okay?
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.400]   And then, again, the special seminar
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.400]   that we're having for abortion, birth control,
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   and IVF on May 4th,
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.400]   we're going to keep taking sign-ups
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.400]   right up to that Saturday.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.400]   We want to try to get as many people
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.400]   to come out as possible.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.400]   Sign-up table is outside,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.400]   so as you're walking outside,
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.400]   there will be a table there,
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   or if you'd rather do it online,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   you can also do it online, okay?
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.400]   And that will be taking place
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.400]   at 9 to 12 p.m. that Saturday,
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   two sessions from Pastor James Lee
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   from Cross Life Bible Church, okay?
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.400]   I think that's it for now.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.400]   Again, just a reminder
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   that our Zelle and, you know,
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   other avenues for online giving
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.400]   is going to be switched to Subsplash.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   So we have this week and next week,
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.400]   and then after that, starting from April,
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   we're only going to be exclusively
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.400]   doing Subsplash.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   So if you haven't done that yet,
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   we encourage you to do that, okay?
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   And those of you who are visiting us
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.400]   and you have a physical offering,
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.400]   there is a physical offering in the back.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   As you're going out,
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.400]   you'll see the box in the back.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   All right, let me pray for us,
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.400]   and we'll get started.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.400]   Father, we thank you.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   We love you.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   We desire to worship you
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   genuinely in spirit and in truth.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.400]   We pray, Father God,
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   that you would search us, know us,
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.400]   see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.400]   Lord, we know that we have
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   a lot of brothers and sisters
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   Lord, we know that we have
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.400]   a lot of brothers and sisters
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.400]   with many struggles, parents,
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.400]   and family members who are sick
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.400]   and in need of much prayer.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   We ask, Lord God,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   that you would guide us and lead us
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   that as a community,
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.400]   that as we grow in number,
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   that it would not simply be in number,
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.400]   but our love for you, our passion,
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   our love for one another
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   would grow along, Lord God,
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.400]   with what you are doing.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   I pray that you would help us
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   that even in this giving,
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   that we would give in a manner
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.400]   that honors you, that glorifies you,
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.400]   and that the offering that we give

[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.400]   Sorry, Luke chapter 19.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.400]   We're going to be reading from verse 28
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   all the way down to verse 44.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:38.400]   As we kick off our Passion Week
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.400]   with the triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   Again, Luke chapter 19, verse 28.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.400]   "After he had said these things,
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   he was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem,
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.400]   when he approached Bethphage and Bethany
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.400]   near the mount that is called Oliveth.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.400]   He sent two of his disciples,
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.400]   saying, 'Go into the village ahead of you.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   There, as you enter, you will find a colt tied
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.400]   on which no one yet has ever sat.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   Untie it and bring it here.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?'
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.400]   you shall say, 'The Lord has need of it.'
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.400]   So those who were sent went away
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   and found it just as he had told them.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   As they were untying the colt,
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   its owner said to them,
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.400]   'Why are you untying the colt?'
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   They said, 'The Lord has need of it.'
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   They brought it to Jesus
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   and threw their coats on the colt
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   and put Jesus on it.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   As he was going,
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   they were spreading their coats on the road.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   As soon as he was approaching
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   near the descent of the Mount of Olives,
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   the whole crowd of the disciples
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.400]   began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   for all the miracles which they had seen,
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   shouting, 'Blessed is the King
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.400]   who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.400]   Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.'
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him,
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   'Teacher, rebuke your disciples.'
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   But Jesus answered, 'I tell you,
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   if these become silent,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   the stones will cry out.'
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.400]   When he approached Jerusalem,
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.400]   he saw the city and wept over it,
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.400]   saying, 'If you had known in this day,
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   even you, the things which make for peace,
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   but now they have been hidden from your eyes.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.400]   For the days will come upon you
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.400]   and surround you and hem you in on every side.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   And they will level you to the ground
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.400]   and your children within you,
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.400]   and they will not leave in you
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.400]   one stone upon another
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.400]   because you did not recognize
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.400]   the time of your visitation.'"
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   Let's pray.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.400]   Father, we ask for insight,
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   understanding, conviction,
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.400]   and sanctification, Lord God,
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   through this text.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   Help us to understand your heart
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   and not just the words.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:43.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   As you already know,
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.400]   today is called Palm Sunday
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   because this is the day where
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.400]   Jesus deliberately rides on the donkey,
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.400]   fulfilling the prophecy
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   that the Messiah was going to come in
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   riding on this donkey
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   and to make a public declaration of who he is.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.400]   Up to this point,
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   there's been a lot of discussion,
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.400]   is he or is he not?
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.400]   Although Jesus has already made it clear,
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.400]   by riding on this donkey,
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   people knew that this was a fulfillment of the prophecy.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   So he was publicly declaring
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.400]   that if there was any guess,
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.400]   if there was any question who he was,
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.400]   Jesus was identifying who he is.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   Right before he enters,
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.400]   a few days before,
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.400]   Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.400]   And this was a very public miracle.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.400]   And so word has already spread.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.400]   So people have already gathered in Jerusalem
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.400]   thinking that maybe they're going to get a glimpse
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.400]   of this Messiah.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   Maybe they can meet him.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.400]   But after the resurrection of,
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   or the raising of Lazarus,
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.400]   there was no question.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.400]   If anybody had any doubt,
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.400]   who else could raise somebody from the dead
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.400]   but the Messiah?
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.400]   And so the crowd, it says,
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   in the different passages,
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.400]   says that it was a very large crowd.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   It was an unusually large crowd.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   Because it's Passover,
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   it was a gathering of all the faithful Jews
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.400]   in that area.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.400]   And already every Passover during that week
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.400]   would have been filled.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   But because of expectation of the Messiah
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.400]   possibly coming into Jerusalem,
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   you can imagine that crowd was not a normal crowd.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:25.400]   It was some measured as high as possibly
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   over a million people in Jerusalem.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.400]   And it's in that context
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.400]   Jesus comes in making a public declaration.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.400]   And so each week, each day this week,
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.400]   we're going to go over what Jesus did on Monday,
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   So by the time we come to the resurrection Sunday next Sunday,
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.400]   that we would have had a whole week of preparing our heart
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.400]   for what that resurrection means to us.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.400]   And hopefully that it will have the effect
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.400]   that we're hoping that it will have on every single one of us,
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.400]   that we would renew our devotion
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.400]   and recognize the importance of this day.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.400]   In Deuteronomy 8, 11-14,
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.400]   the question some people,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.400]   if you haven't participated in it before,
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.400]   may be asking,
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.400]   "We know the resurrection Sunday is important,
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.400]   but why this big of a deal?"
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.400]   Every single day, this is the busiest week.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.400]   For us at our church, more than Christmas,
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:22.400]   this resurrection Sunday is the busiest week.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:26.400]   We will be here every single day this week.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.400]   And we're going to go over the text,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.400]   and we're going to have different people giving testimonies.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:35.400]   But the reason why we need to do this,
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   we feel that this is beneficial for us,
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.400]   is the same reason why God gave the Israelites
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.400]   so many festivals.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.400]   They probably have more festivals
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.400]   than any other culture that we know.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   Almost every month, there's some sort of a holiday
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.400]   on their calendar.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.400]   And all their calendars point to something that God has done
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.400]   so that they do not forget.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.400]   In Deuteronomy 8, 11-14, it says,
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.400]   "Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.400]   by not keeping His commandments."
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.400]   So I want you to remember that.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.400]   To not to forget.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.400]   Because there was a constant concern
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400]   that they were going to forget.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.400]   That you do not forget the Lord your God
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400]   by not keeping His commandments
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.400]   and His ordinances and His statutes,
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.400]   which I am commanding you today.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.400]   Because there is a tendency for every single one of us,
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   after a while, after the honeymoon stage
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400]   of your walk with God,
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   that we get into this pattern of being churched.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   And instead of really giving worship that God deserves,
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   we just put in our time.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400]   We do what you're supposed to do because it's Sundays,
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.400]   because it's tradition, because of habit.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   It says, "So you do not forget the commandments."
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.400]   Verse 12, "Otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.400]   and have built good houses and lived in them,
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.400]   and when your herds and your flocks multiplied
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400]   and your silver and gold multiplied
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400]   and all that you have multiplies,
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.400]   then your heart will become proud
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.400]   and you will forget the Lord your God
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400]   who brought you out from the land of Egypt,
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   out of the house of slavery."
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.400]   So there's two things that he says that he's concerned about.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.400]   One is that we forget.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.400]   And when we forget,
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.400]   what naturally happens is we become proud.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   And this is a pattern that every single Christian struggles with.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.400]   Once Christianity becomes a habit in our lives,
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.400]   it becomes a tradition,
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:28.400]   and there's no fire underneath us.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   There's no emergency.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   We have a tendency to cling to God when somebody is sick
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   and when there's an emergency
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400]   or something happens where we are desperate
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400]   and something in our lives reminds us
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.400]   how desperate we are for God.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400]   But when that's not taking place,
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.400]   our bills are paid,
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.400]   we are in somewhat good health,
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   and our jobs are secure,
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400]   our children are taken care of,
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.400]   our natural tendency is to drift,
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.400]   and we become proud.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.400]   And when we become proud,
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.400]   you don't have to stick your neck out and say,
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.400]   "I am the best to be proud."
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   You don't necessarily feel the need for Christ.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.400]   You want Christ, but you don't feel the need for Christ.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.400]   And there's a huge difference between
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   somebody who's praying because he needs Christ
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.400]   versus somebody who's praying because he desires Christ.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.400]   It may sound like semantics,
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.400]   but there's a world of difference,
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.400]   of a prayer of desperation.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400]   And I think if you've ever prayed in desperation,
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.400]   you know the difference.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.400]   Scripture tells us that God has placed
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.400]   all these things in the Jewish calendar
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.400]   so they do not forget,
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.400]   so that they will not become proud
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.400]   because God has blessed them.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.400]   The text that we're looking at,
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400]   Jesus comes in riding on the donkey,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.400]   fulfilling the prophecy,
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.400]   and it says, "Jesus wept."
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.400]   Can you imagine the excitement of Palm Sunday?
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.400]   I don't think there was a million people waiting for him
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   as he was riding on this donkey,
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.400]   but can you imagine the large crowd,
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.400]   even 1,000, even 10,000,
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   screaming out, "Hosanna, Hosanna,"
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400]   waving palm branches.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.400]   Usually that's what they did when their army would go out
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.400]   and come back in victory and celebration.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.400]   So much like if you see old footages
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400]   of people coming back from war in World War II
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.400]   and they would have confetti falling from the skyscrapers.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   That's the scene, that in the middle of this huge parade
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.400]   with expectation, jubilation,
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.400]   it says that when Jesus came in, he wept.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.400]   Now, it doesn't tell us that the disciples saw him weeping
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   and they asked him, "What are you doing?
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   Why are you weeping? We're all celebrating."
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.400]   The disciples were confused.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.400]   Even though Jesus said that he was going to go to the cross,
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.400]   they didn't hear him, they didn't understand him,
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.400]   so they just went through one ear and out the other.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400]   I think in the same way they saw Jesus weeping,
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.400]   they couldn't understand why he was weeping.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.400]   It wasn't until afterwards, after the resurrection,
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.400]   after the blinders came off,
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.400]   they remembered, "Yes, Jesus wept."
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.400]   Now I understand why he wept.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   Why did Jesus weep?
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.400]   In the middle of thousands, hundreds of thousands,
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   calling out his name.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400]   Well, there's two instances in the Bible
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.400]   where it tells us where Jesus wept.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.400]   The first instance is in John 11, 35,
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.400]   when Jesus is standing at Lazarus' tomb
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.400]   and in compassion with all the other people
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.400]   weeping in sadness over Lazarus,
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.400]   it says that Jesus wept.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.400]   But the word that is used for "wept" in that passage
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.400]   is very different than the word that is used here.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.400]   That word there is "dacru,"
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.400]   and even though it is translated "wept,"
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:03.400]   the word closely is tied to somebody who is in tears.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:09.400]   Not loud weeping, not wailing, just sadness.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   Now, again, that's another good question.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.400]   Why was he even sad?
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.400]   Why was he even in tears
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.400]   when he deliberately waited to get to Lazarus?
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.400]   And I've mentioned this before in another sermon,
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   and I believe the reason why he was in tears
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   is because the sadness of mankind's judgment.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   And he was sad, and even though he knew
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400]   that Lazarus was going to come back from the dead,
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.400]   he did all of that so that he would show his power,
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   and yet it says Jesus cried.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.400]   That would be a closer translation.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   But in this text, the word for "wept" is "closet,"
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.400]   and it is closer to the English translation "wept."
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.400]   It means loud mourning.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.400]   He was uncontrollable.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.400]   So in the context, the contrast between the crowds
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.400]   who are yelling out his name
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.400]   versus Jesus wailing and crying out,
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.400]   and he says, "Because you did not recognize
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.400]   the day of visitation."
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.400]   And the explanation that is given to us in this text
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.400]   is that they did not recognize
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.400]   what would bring peace in verse 42.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.400]   "If you had known in this day, even you,
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.400]   the things which make for peace,
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.400]   but now they have been hidden from your eyes."
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   They have been hidden from your eyes.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.400]   Jesus wept because of the judgment
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400]   that was going to come,
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.400]   because of what was about to happen,
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.400]   and he knew that they were going to betray him,
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400]   that they were going to turn him in,
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.400]   and he was going to be crucified,
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.400]   because the peace that they wanted him to bring,
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.400]   and once they realized that the peace that they wanted,
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.400]   he wasn't going to bring,
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.400]   that they were going to turn on him.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.400]   And he said this was not just any ordinary judgment.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.400]   He said when the judgment comes
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   that they're going to tear apart a temple,
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.400]   that not even one stone is going to be left alone.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   Now that was not an exaggeration,
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.400]   because in AD 70, that's exactly what happens.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.400]   The Jews finally said, you know what,
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.400]   if the Messiah's not going to deliver us,
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400]   we're going to gather our army,
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.400]   and we're going to give it our all.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400]   May the Lord bless us,
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.400]   and they went at it with the Romans,
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.400]   and obviously they couldn't conquer them,
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.400]   and the Romans came in,
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.400]   and the fire that they lit into this temple
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   was so strong that the gold in this temple
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.400]   started melting underneath the stones.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.400]   So the soldiers who wanted to get to this gold
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   took up every single stone in this temple,
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.400]   hoping that they would be able to find gold,
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.400]   and by doing so fulfilled literally what Jesus said.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.400]   Not a single stone would be left behind,
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.400]   and it would be overturned,
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   and the reason why is because you did not recognize
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   what would bring true peace.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.400]   Now, their desire for peace.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.400]   Humanly speaking, we can understand why,
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.400]   because if you look at the prophecies in the Old Testament,
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.400]   almost every prophecy in the Old Testament
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.400]   promises some level of peace.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.400]   In Isaiah 11 and 1 through 2, it says,
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.400]   "Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse,
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.400]   "and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.400]   "The spirit of the Lord will rest upon him,
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   "the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.400]   "the spirit of counsel and strength,
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.400]   "the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord."
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   Again, a detailed explanation
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.400]   of what the Messiah is going to look like.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.400]   And then he says,
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.400]   "And the wolf will dwell with the lamb,
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.400]   "and the leopard will lie down with the young goat,
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.400]   "and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together,
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400]   "and a little boy will lead them."
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.400]   In other words, this is a picture of terror, turmoil
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.400]   that sin has brought in is going to be restored.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.400]   In Isaiah 11 and 8,
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   "The nursing child will play by the hold of the cobra,
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   "and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den."
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.400]   I could sit here and go through passage after passage
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.400]   of promise of peace that the Messiah is going to bring.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.400]   And it was not a localized peace.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   If you read the text carefully,
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.400]   it says it's going to be worldwide peace,
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.400]   that the Messiah is going to take away all the wars,
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.400]   all the turmoil, the strife between husband and wife,
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   with parents and their children,
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.400]   a society that is broken apart.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   We look at our society today,
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.400]   and if I asked you what's the problem of our generation,
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.400]   every single one of you will have a list of things
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.400]   that you think has gone wrong,
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   whether it's political, economical, relational,
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.400]   familial, educational, whatever it may be,
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.400]   every single one of us are very aware
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.400]   that something has gone wrong.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.400]   And we have our own thoughts on how this needs to be restored.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   And the Jews were no different.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.400]   But the difference between the Jews
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.400]   and our modern-day people is that the Jews,
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.400]   their whole answer was the Messiah.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   When he comes, when the righteous Messiah comes,
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   filled with the Holy Spirit,
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.400]   with the power of God behind him,
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.400]   peace is finally going to come.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.400]   You know, what's interesting is the word "Jerusalem"
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   literally means "city of peace."
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.400]   He embedded that.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.400]   It's embedded into their psyche.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.400]   It's embedded into everything that they believed--peace.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.400]   When the Messiah comes, he's going to finally bring peace.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.400]   Well, if the central thing about Jesus
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   and what he did on the cross was to bring about peace,
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.400]   and the reason why judgment came upon Israel
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.400]   was because they did not see peace,
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.400]   shouldn't we understand what that peace is?
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.400]   Shouldn't we make sure that we're not like the Jews,
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   that our idea of peace is biblical,
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   that what we're considering, what we're hoping for,
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.400]   how we think what has gone wrong is going to get fixed,
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.400]   that we're not like the Jews of that time,
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.400]   hoping that if we are faithful, if we do the right thing,
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.400]   that somehow peace is going to come into our life?
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.400]   Well, Webster's Dictionary describes peace
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.400]   as a state of tranquility and quietness.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.400]   There's no turmoil.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   Second, freedom from civil disturbance to bring peace.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.400]   That's why we call police officers "peace officers."
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   Or harmony in personal relationships.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   Maybe it's not societal.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.400]   Maybe it's a lot more personal because we're having problems
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.400]   within our own family and relationships.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   But again, those are things that the world sees.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   That's what peace means.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.400]   Now, the biblical definition of peace isn't devoid of that,
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   but it's much more than that.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.400]   In fact, to the Jews, peace was everything,
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.400]   and that's why it's in their greeting.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.400]   Shalom, peace, right?
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   Peace.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.400]   You know, in our culture, we say hello,
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   but beyond the hello, right?
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.400]   In America, what do we say?
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.400]   Bless you, right?
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   Bless you. God bless you.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.400]   Because we're singing for the Lord's blessing.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.400]   In the Jewish culture, everything was about shalom.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.400]   In fact, in the Tanchuma Shoftim,
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.400]   I'm butchering the pronunciation, right?
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.400]   It was basically the Jewish version of their constitution.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   It was their teaching of how their society should be ruled by God's law.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.400]   And in their teaching, it says all that is written in the Torah
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:04.400]   was written for the sake of peace.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   In other words, in this constitution,
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.400]   their central point of their constitution,
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.400]   it states in summary that everything that we do
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.400]   is for the purpose of peace.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.400]   Why we disorganize a certain way,
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.400]   why we keep the law,
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.400]   why we punish evil,
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   why the family structure,
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.400]   why the temple.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   It said everything that was given to the Jewish nation,
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.400]   the central purpose is to bring peace.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.400]   That's why they would greet each other shalom.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.400]   The root word for the Hebrew word for shalom
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.400]   comes from the word shaleim,
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.400]   which means completion.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.400]   To be complete.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.400]   Perfection.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.400]   Restoration of what had been intended.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.400]   So peace isn't simply not having trouble.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   Peace isn't simply not fighting.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.400]   The Jewish understanding of the word shalom
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.400]   is to be restored.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.400]   To be made complete.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   So the idea of shalom is directly connected to the sabbath.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400]   Because the word sabbath,
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   we know that it means rest.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.400]   But rest isn't simply because we are fatigued
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.400]   and that we need to be restored
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400]   so that we can go back to work on Monday.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   That's typically how we think of sabbath.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.400]   We worked hard for five, six days,
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.400]   and so we need to take a break
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.400]   so that we can start over on Monday.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.400]   But the idea of sabbath comes all the way from the creation
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   when God created the world in six days
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.400]   and then it says on the seventh day he rested.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.400]   So did God rest because he was tired
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   and he needed to be restored
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.400]   so that he can go back and create more things on Monday?
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400]   No.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   It means that what he had intended to create,
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.400]   it is done, it is complete.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.400]   So his sabbath was complete.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400]   And he brought the rest of creation,
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.400]   including mankind, into that sabbath.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   But the problem is when man sinned,
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400]   that sabbath was broken.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.400]   What was complete and whole was broken.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.400]   And that's why the whole purpose of salvation
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.400]   is to restore us back into that sabbath.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.400]   To bring us back into the seventh day
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.400]   where the work is complete,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.400]   where rest and wholeness is restored.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:28.400]   So the idea of shalom
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.400]   is directly connected to the teaching of the sabbath
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   in the Bible.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.400]   To bring us back to what God had intended.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   So whenever they said shalom,
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.400]   the understanding was may rest come upon you.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.400]   May the sabbath be restored.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:52.400]   The very last word,
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.400]   as Jesus was hanging on the cross,
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.400]   remember what he said?
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.400]   It is what?
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   Finished.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   It is finished.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   It is complete.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   Meaning that everything that they've been waiting for,
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   everything that they desired,
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   the completion, the peace that he brought,
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400]   he says it is finished.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   It is complete.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   It is restored.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   It's not simply that the crucifixion is done
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400]   but he's at the end of his life.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.400]   He said everything that was needed
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.400]   to restore the sabbath is complete.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.400]   In other words, shalom has come.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   The English equivalent to this word completion in the Bible
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   in the Greek is teleos,
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.400]   which means to be complete.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400]   And so wherever this word teleos
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   is written in the New Testament,
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.400]   it is translated complete.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   The completion.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.400]   In 1 Corinthians 13.10, it says when the complete comes,
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.400]   when the perfect comes,
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   the imperfect shall pass away.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   So the word complete is also translated perfect.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   When the perfect is restored,
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.400]   what God had intended is restored,
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   all the things that are imperfect will go away.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   Isaiah 54.10, God's covenant with Israel
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.400]   is called the covenant of peace,
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   covenant of shalom.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   Preaching of the gospel is described as preaching peace
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   to those who are near, to those who are far.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.400]   So the gospel is called the gospel of peace.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.400]   Romans 5.1 is described, our salvation is described
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:36.400]   as having peace with God, to be complete.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.400]   And then finally, Jesus himself is described in Isaiah 9.6
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.400]   as the prince of peace.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:49.400]   So this concept of shalom is central
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.400]   to our understanding of our salvation.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.400]   If we miss this, you have not simply missed
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.400]   a portion of our salvation.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   You will come to church looking for peace,
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.400]   and you will not find peace.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.400]   If you don't find peace, it's time for you to move on.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.400]   Sometimes you'll move on from church to church.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.400]   Then after a while, when that gets exhausted,
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.400]   then you will move on from your faith itself.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.400]   I don't know how many people in our generation
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   has moved online.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.400]   Because I haven't rejected Christ,
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   but I've rejected the church.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.400]   Because I couldn't find peace there.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   So I want Jesus, but all that's attached to Jesus,
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.400]   I've been too disappointed.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.400]   I don't want any part of that.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   So they've moved on.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.400]   In their hearts, they haven't moved on from Christ.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   They're still holding on.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.400]   But the fear is that people who have rejected the church,
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:58.400]   thinking that they haven't rejected Christ,
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.400]   the church is the body of Christ.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.400]   You cannot reject the body and say,
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.400]   "I'm still committed to the head."
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:12.400]   You cannot do one without the other.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   In John 1:5, it says, "The light shines in darkness,
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.400]   but the darkness has not understood it."
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.400]   It did not comprehend it.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.400]   That's exactly why Jesus was weeping.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.400]   He came to bring peace, to fulfill everything
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.400]   that God had promised.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   And yet they're looking at him, and Jesus knew.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.400]   Jesus knew what was in their heart.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.400]   Even before he walked into Jerusalem,
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.400]   the scripture tells us that he would not give himself
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.400]   to the multitudes, because he knew what?
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.400]   He knew what was in their heart.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   John chapter 6, after he feeds the 5,000,
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.400]   they're chasing after him.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   Thousands of people.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:54.400]   I mean, they just would not leave him alone.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.400]   And they wanted to forcefully make him king,
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   but they find him on the other side of the Sea of Galilee
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   and said, "Lord, why did you leave us?"
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.400]   And Jesus, confronting them, he says,
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   "You did not come to me because you know who I am.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:12.400]   You came to me because you ate, and you want more.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.400]   You don't know who I am.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.400]   You don't know why I came.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   You just think that if you follow me,
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:23.400]   you're going to be fed, that you're going to be healed."
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.400]   He says, "I am the bread.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.400]   I did not just come to give you bread.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.400]   I am the bread.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.400]   I didn't just come to quench your thirst.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   I am the living water."
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:44.400]   Now, I know you've heard this before.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.400]   You can hear the truth over and over,
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.400]   year after year after year.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   But when you have committed yourself to a paradigm,
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.400]   and I need this, I want this,
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.400]   even when you hear the truth,
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   it goes into the wrong bucket.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   Just like when Jesus said, "I'm going to the cross.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.400]   I'm going to the cross.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   I'm going to the cross.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.400]   They're going to crucify me."
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.400]   He said, "Well, who's going to be glorified the most
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.400]   when you come?"
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.400]   They were in the physical presence of Christ,
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:21.400]   heard the audible voice of the Son of God,
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   and they did not understand.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.400]   You can come to church all your life
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.400]   thinking that somehow you are fulfilling
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   and pursuing Christ when you are not
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:39.400]   because you did not understand what he came to bring.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:45.400]   The Sadducees, they thought that since they can't,
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.400]   and they've already given hope.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.400]   For hundreds of years, the Jews were suppressed
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.400]   by one pagan nation after another,
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.400]   now the Romans.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.400]   So they've given up on any kind of spiritual intervention.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.400]   They've given up on the resurrection.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   They've given up on miracles.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.400]   They've given up on angels.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.400]   So the Sadducees, who were the senators,
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.400]   they were the ones who were in power of this time.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   The leaders of Israel basically have given up on God,
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.400]   but they're still committed to their nation.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.400]   So the way that they sought peace was assimilation.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.400]   If you can't win them, join them.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:29.400]   So they decided to adopt the things of the Romans,
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.400]   to submit to them, do whatever they asked,
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   and in return, they will be favored.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   So the Sadducees were the ones that were favored
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.400]   by the Roman government because they submitted to the law.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.400]   They did everything that they told them to do.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.400]   So they were the senators.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.400]   They were the ones who were overseeing the temple,
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.400]   even though they have given up on God.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.400]   So the way that they were going to seek peace
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.400]   is by assimilating to the world.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.400]   Do we have that today in our culture?
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.400]   Absolutely.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:02.400]   More and more churches today are seeking peace
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:08.400]   by trying to find peace with the world.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.400]   We're not going to go against that.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.400]   What point is that?
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400]   We're not going to anger them.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.400]   So we're going to preach a gospel with no teeth.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.400]   We're going to preach a gospel with no judgment.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.400]   So the Christianity that they are propagating
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.400]   has nothing to do with the gospel of the Bible.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.400]   It's just the promise of hope, peace, love.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.400]   And who doesn't want that?
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.400]   Whether that comes out of the mouth of Buddha,
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.400]   whether that comes out of the mouth of Muhammad,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.400]   who's going to reject that gospel?
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   So we have a generation of people,
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400]   just like the Sadducees,
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.400]   who have committed that if they assimilate,
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.400]   if they have peace,
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400]   the ones who are suppressing us,
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.400]   that we will somehow benefit.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.400]   That's how the Sadducees decided that they were going to find peace.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400]   And then we had the Zealots.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.400]   Zealots were the other end.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.400]   We cannot accept this.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.400]   We cannot accept these Sadducees who've given up on God,
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.400]   who compromises these pagans.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:09.400]   So they decided that they're going to carry a sword.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.400]   And every opportunity they get,
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.400]   they're going to match power with power on the other end.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.400]   And so they had every opportunity.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.400]   They were the ones who were gathering.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   They're going to put fear into their nation.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.400]   They're not going to be able to fight them from army to army.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.400]   So they're going to become the terrorists.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.400]   They're going to terrorize the Romans.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   Their idea of peace was going to come by force,
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:44.400]   if not by army to army, by guerrilla warfare.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.400]   Those were the Zealots.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.400]   But at the core of why they did that
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.400]   was because they thought that that was going to bring peace.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.400]   And then you had the Essenes,
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.400]   who just packed up their bags.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.400]   And they went out to the wilderness, lived in caves,
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.400]   see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:09.400]   If we don't see, if we don't engage,
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.400]   if we just leave them alone,
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.400]   then we're going to find tranquility out in the desert, in the cave.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.400]   So their idea of peace is as long as no one is fighting,
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.400]   as long as we don't have to hear them,
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.400]   we don't have to see them, that we're okay.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.400]   Even if everything else in the world is falling apart,
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.400]   we're just going to be in the cave, we're just going to live our own life.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.400]   The core of why they did that is they were also seeking peace.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.400]   But the greatest tragedy were the Pharisees.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.400]   Because the Pharisees decided
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.400]   that the only way that they're going to have peace
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.400]   is to get God's blessing.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   And the word "Pharisee" itself basically means to be set apart.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.400]   It means to be holy.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   We're going to find peace by being holy.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.400]   Because our ancestors,
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.400]   they lost peace because they would not keep the law.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.400]   They were taken into captivity because they wouldn't keep the Sabbath.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.400]   So they were the ones who were committed, religiously,
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.400]   to receive God's blessing by their work.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.400]   So nobody worked harder than them.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.400]   Nobody prayed more than they did.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.400]   Nobody gave more than they did.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.400]   Nobody sacrificed more than they did.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.400]   Nobody proselytized more than these guys.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.400]   They kept the Sabbath so meticulously,
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.400]   and that's why they kept on having problems with Jesus.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.400]   Because the Sabbath tradition that they created,
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   and they kept on adding to the law,
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.400]   because you have to keep the Sabbath if God's going to bless us.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.400]   If peace is going to return back into Israel,
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.400]   we have to keep the law.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.400]   And at the center of this law was the Sabbath.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.400]   So if we want to keep the Sabbath law meticulously,
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.400]   they kept on defining, well, what does it mean to them?
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.400]   What does it mean to work?
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.400]   Is this breaking the Sabbath?
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400]   What if we go this far? Is it breaking the Sabbath?
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.400]   What if we touch a rope? What if we put it down?
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.400]   What if we milk a cow? What if we drink the milk that came from a cow?
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.400]   And so they had all these rules.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.400]   Because they thought that if they kept that,
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:21.400]   the peace and Sabbath was going to come.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.400]   Jesus says in the context, because they kept on saying,
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.400]   "You are a Sabbath breaker,
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.400]   and we can't allow you to continue to grow
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.400]   because you keep breaking our tradition."
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.400]   Not the Sabbath of the Bible, but our tradition.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.400]   And Jesus says in Mark 2, 27-28,
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.400]   Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.400]   So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:53.400]   In other words, you Pharisees completely missed the whole point.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:28:00.400]   You're trying so hard to get the Lord's blessing by keeping the law,
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.400]   but you completely missed the whole point of the Sabbath.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:09.400]   He said the Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.400]   Now, think about that.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:18.400]   Again, Sadducees are the liberals.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.400]   That's not where you and I are.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.400]   And then the Zealots.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.400]   Zealots are the ones who are going to militantly,
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.400]   we're going to, by force, take over.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:32.400]   For the most part, that's not us.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.400]   We're not the Esses, because we're in the thick of things.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.400]   We didn't pack up our bags and move to some island.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400]   So we're not the Esses.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:46.400]   But if we're not careful, we can be just like the Pharisees.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.400]   That we can become very religious
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:54.400]   and do the right things for the wrong reason
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.400]   and completely miss Christ.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:01.400]   And at the core of it is because we want peace.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.400]   We want peace.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.400]   So if you're a Pharisee, in this kind of context,
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.400]   you can't tell.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.400]   We're just good Christians.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:14.400]   If you're a Pharisee in a church like ours,
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.400]   you can't tell the difference.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.400]   You say, "Oh, he's a legalist."
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.400]   You can't tell by the action itself,
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.400]   because we're doing the right thing.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.400]   You can't tell, it's like, "Oh, you're a Pharisee
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.400]   "because you think somehow that's going to lead to salvation."
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.400]   You don't know what they're thinking.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.400]   The Pharisees, we wouldn't have known.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.400]   I mean, should you have kept the Sabbath? Yes.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.400]   Should you have proselytized? Yes.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:40.400]   Did God call them to give? Yes.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.400]   Did God tell them to study the law,
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.400]   debate over what it means to be experts of the law?
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.400]   All of that was commanded by God.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:52.400]   You couldn't tell that they were Pharisees
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.400]   simply by what they were doing externally.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.400]   It's because God was able to see beyond that.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:01.400]   They were doing the right things for the wrong reason.
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:05.400]   And we can easily fall into that,
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:10.400]   where we're seeking peace through the law.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:13.400]   Where you come to church,
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.400]   and the church doesn't bring you peace.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.400]   Initially, it was like, "Man, I found a community
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.400]   "where we can be one another, and we're so encouraging."
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:24.400]   But as soon as that gets broken,
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:27.400]   "Oh, I'm not going to find peace here."
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.400]   Hebrews 10.29 says, "How much severe punishment
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.400]   "do you think he will deserve,
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.400]   "who has trampled underfoot the Son of God,
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.400]   "and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.400]   "by which he was sanctified,
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   "and has insulted the spirit of grace?"
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:47.400]   The whole book of Hebrews was written for people who forgot.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.400]   It may be in danger of becoming proud.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.400]   And as a result, the way it's described,
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.400]   how much severe a punishment would there be
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:00.400]   for those who trample underfoot the Son of God,
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.400]   which is sacred, which is at the core,
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.400]   and you move beyond.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.400]   You know how that happens?
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.400]   You know how we end up trampling what is sacred?
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.400]   In Hebrews 2.3 it says, "How will we escape
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:16.400]   "if we neglect so great a salvation?"
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.400]   Simply by neglect.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.400]   We don't take the cross and trample it on the ground.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   We don't spit on it.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.400]   We don't teach heresy.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:29.400]   It just happens when it's no longer sacred.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.400]   It becomes a habit, just something that we do.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:38.400]   And after a while, we feel when we've done well,
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:41.400]   God needs to answer my prayers.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.400]   He needs to make things right.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.400]   And then when I've done, I've sacrificed,
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.400]   and God doesn't give me what I desire,
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   I didn't get the peace that I wanted.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.400]   I didn't get the rest that I wanted.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.400]   Simply by neglect.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:03.400]   I know some of you come from broken homes.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.400]   And as a result from coming from broken homes,
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:09.400]   you think that if you get married,
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.400]   find a good wife, good husband,
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:17.400]   that what was broken will be restored.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.400]   So many people come into a marriage
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:24.400]   thinking that they're going to find shalom in their home.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.400]   And when they don't find it,
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.400]   all kinds of turmoil break out.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.400]   Because your wife and your husband
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.400]   isn't bringing you peace.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:38.400]   Some of you grew up in immigrant homes
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:42.400]   where the parents tried so hard to make money.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.400]   They had a hard time paying bills.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.400]   They were young.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.400]   He said, "When I get older,
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.400]   "I'm going to make sure that my children
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:52.400]   "don't go through what I went through."
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.400]   So in your heart, you think
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.400]   that whatever turmoil that you may have experienced
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.400]   when you were a child,
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.400]   that if you had enough money,
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:04.400]   that you will find your shalom.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.400]   So you're chasing money.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.400]   Even though you're worshiping God on Sunday,
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.400]   but Monday through Saturday,
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.400]   you are consumed with making money.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.400]   You're trying to get things in order
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.400]   so that my children don't go through what I went through.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.400]   And so you're trying to find shalom
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.400]   through your hard work,
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.400]   through right decisions, right investments.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.400]   And as time goes by,
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:33.400]   you realize that that shalom is elusive.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:37.400]   Some of you came from abuse.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.400]   You know, it's no longer shocking to me.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.400]   It was shocking early on in ministry
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:47.400]   how many of our sisters have been abused.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.400]   According to statistics, it's one in four,
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.400]   and I think that's larger than that now,
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.400]   at least from experience.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   And it's no longer just women.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.400]   I don't know how many instances,
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.400]   men and women, but particularly our sisters,
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.400]   who have been abused when they were young.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.400]   And as a result of that,
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:08.400]   they feel like, "I lost my peace."
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.400]   And you're jumping from relationship to relationship
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.400]   to situation to situation,
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.400]   hoping to find some rest,
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.400]   and you don't find it.
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:21.400]   It's been five years, 10 years, 20 years, 40 years,
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:24.400]   and it's not coming.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.400]   And now you are maybe beginning to lose hope.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.400]   Where is this shalom?
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.400]   Why is this not coming?
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.400]   Even after all these years, why is this not coming?
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.400]   Maybe God is not real.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:40.400]   Maybe God doesn't care.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.400]   Some of you have been hurt by people,
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.400]   have been betrayed, maybe in the church,
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.400]   maybe by the leadership.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.400]   And so you're having a hard time.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.400]   I love Christ, but I don't love the church.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.400]   And so you're at that.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.400]   You're acquaintances with everybody,
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:56.400]   but you're stiff-arming everybody
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.400]   because you don't want to get hurt again
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.400]   because your shalom was broken,
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.400]   or at least so you think.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.400]   Every single one of us, in some sense,
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   is seeking to have the Sabbath restored
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:13.400]   because that's what was lost
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.400]   when man fell at peace.
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.400]   Whatever you call it,
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.400]   there's something inside of us
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.400]   that is desiring desperately for peace.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.400]   And then when you get older,
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.400]   you realize and you get disappointed.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.400]   Maybe this isn't it.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400]   Maybe that isn't it.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   And then now we look forward to retirement.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   Maybe if I just disengage,
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.400]   maybe if I don't have to work,
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.400]   maybe if I don't have responsibility,
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.400]   maybe if I don't have to deal with people,
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.400]   and I can finally retire,
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.400]   then I'm going to find my shalom.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.400]   It is no different
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.400]   because that's what the Jews wanted.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   That's what they thought
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.400]   that Jesus was going to bring.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.400]   And when they were shaking their palm branches
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.400]   and saying, "Hosanna, hosanna,"
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.400]   they were waiting for that shalom
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.400]   to be restored.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.400]   And Jesus weeps.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.400]   If only you knew.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.400]   If only you knew
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.400]   what would bring that Sabbath.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.400]   Christ came to bring that Sabbath back.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.400]   Christ and Christ alone.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:20.400]   Not the leaders.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.400]   Not your husband.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.400]   Not your wife.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:25.400]   Not your job.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.400]   Not your retirement.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.400]   Not physical rest.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.400]   Not an organization.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:36.400]   Christ and Christ alone.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.400]   You can come to church all your life
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.400]   and never,
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.400]   your love for Christ never grows any deeper
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:49.400]   because you're seeking for shalom in the church.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.400]   You're seeking for shalom in your vacations,
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.400]   in your time off.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.400]   The reason why this week is so important
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:04.400]   is to recalibrate our thoughts, our heart,
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.400]   so we do not forget.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.400]   We do not forget and we do not become proud
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.400]   so we do not simply drift
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.400]   into the current of this world.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:20.400]   Christ and Christ alone is our shalom.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.400]   And I pray that every event that we do,
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:24.400]   we participate in this week,
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.400]   will remind us of that
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.400]   and that next week when we come back together
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.400]   on Sunday,
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:32.400]   that we would all be able to celebrate
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.400]   the shalom of Christ.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:41.400]   Let's pray.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:48.400]   Father, as we kick off this Passion Week,
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:51.400]   help us, Lord God, as a church,
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:54.400]   wherever we are now,
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.400]   whether we have been striving
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.400]   and want to get deeper with you,
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.400]   whether we have been drifting
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.400]   and need to be recalled back into your presence,
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.400]   I pray that you would help us
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.400]   that every part of this week
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:13.400]   would soften our hearts,
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.400]   break our pride,
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.400]   that we would not simply say
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.400]   that we have been crucified with Christ
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.400]   with words, with empty theology,
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.400]   but that all this ambition
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.400]   and hope that we have placed on wrong things
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.400]   would be laid at the cross,
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.400]   that we would be able to recognize
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.400]   the shalom of Christ.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:55.400]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.400]   We'll sing "When Peace Like a River."
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:11.400]   When peace like a river attended my way,
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:24.400]   When sorrows like sea billows rolled,
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:35.400]   Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:48.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:40:01.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:21.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:27.400]   Though Satan should buffet,
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:33.400]   Though trials should come,
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:46.400]   Let this blest assurance control
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:58.400]   That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   And has shed His own blood for my soul.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:24.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:36.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:42.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.400]   My sin, O the bliss!
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:56.400]   My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought!
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:09.400]   My sin, not in part, but the whole,
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:21.400]   Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:34.400]   Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:47.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:43:07.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:20.400]   And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sighed,
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:33.400]   The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:45.400]   The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:44:04.400]   Even so, it is well with my soul.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:23.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:41.400]   It is well, it is well with my soul.
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.400]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:49.400]   the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:54.400]   and the deep, deep love of God the Father,
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:59.400]   rest, restore, encourage, challenge,
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.400]   and strengthen us and sanctify us,
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:07.400]   that we may declare the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:11.400]   that more and more eyes of the people in our generation
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:16.400]   will be opened, will be delivered from the power of our enemy,
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:20.400]   that they also may come to worship our only God,
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.400]   in spirit and in truth.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:27.400]   Lead us, guide us, restore us this week,
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:30.400]   as we remember the suffering of Christ.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.400]   Amen.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:44.400]   God sent His Son, then called Him Jesus.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:55.400]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:46:06.400]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:17.400]   An empty grave is there to put my Savior last.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:28.400]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:39.400]   Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:50.400]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:47:00.400]   And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:05.400]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:11.400]   And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.400]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:21.400]   And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:26.400]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:31.400]   Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:36.400]   Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:46.400]   The King of glory, the King above all kings.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:51.400]   Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.400]   and leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:02.400]   The King of glory, the King above all kings.
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:07.400]   This is amazing grace.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.400]   This is unfailing love.
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:17.400]   That You would take my place.
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.400]   That You would bear my cross.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.400]   You laid down Your life.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:34.400]   That I would be set free.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.400]   Jesus, I sing for all that You've done for me.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:54.400]   Who brings our chaos back into order?
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:59.400]   Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:04.400]   The King of glory, the King of glory.
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.400]   Who rules the nations with truth and justice?
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:14.400]   Shines like the sun in all of His brilliance.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:21.400]   The King of glory, the King above all kings.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.400]   This is amazing grace.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:31.400]   This is unfailing love.
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:36.400]   That You would take my place.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:41.400]   That You would bear my cross.
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.400]   You laid down Your life.
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:53.400]   That I would be set free.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.400]   Jesus, I sing for all that You've done for me.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:08.400]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.400]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.400]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.400]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:27.400]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.400]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
