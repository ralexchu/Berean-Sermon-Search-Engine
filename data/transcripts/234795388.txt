[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 11, I'll be reading from
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.160]   verse 11 all the way down to verse 15.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.800]   Romans chapter 11, verse 11 through 15.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.100]   So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall?
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.680]   By no means.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.360]   Rather through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles so as to make Israel
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.360]   jealous.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.800]   Now, if their trespass means riches for the world and if their failure means riches for
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.160]   the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean?
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.720]   Now I am speaking to you Gentiles, inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.560]   magnify my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous and thus save some
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.640]   of them.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.600]   For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.120]   but life from the dead?
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.280]   Let's pray.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.200]   Heavenly Father, we ask that you would anoint this time and as you have promised that your
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.000]   word would judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart, help us Lord God to continue
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.400]   to grow, to be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that we may know your perfect
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.960]   will and thought.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.160]   I pray Father God that only your word would go forth and that your people will hear the
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.400]   voice of Christ and follow him.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.320]   We thank you Father in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:33.240]   You know, Apostle Paul in a book, Letter to the Ephesians, he concludes his doxology,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.040]   his presentation of the gospel message about election, about predestination, about adoption
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.960]   and about how we were saved and how he pursued us and then in conclusion before he gets to
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.600]   the imperatives and how we ought to apply these things in our lives, he concludes by
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.920]   praying for them and this is his prayer.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.360]   I pray that you may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth, what
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.520]   is the length, what is the height and depth and to know the love of Christ that surpasses
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.800]   knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.240]   The more I experience Christian life, the more I am compelled and the more I see how
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.400]   important it is that everything that we do is compelled by the love of Christ.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.760]   Now we have all kinds of means to motivate people to do things, right?
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.160]   There's accountability, rewards that if you do this, you know, you're going to be rewarded
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.360]   this way or maybe even shaming or fear if you don't do this, you know, we're going to
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.560]   judge you and there's all kinds of ways that we are motivated to do certain things or not
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.120]   to do certain things.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.680]   But ultimately in our walk with God, if the love of Christ isn't continually compelling
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.800]   us, every good thing that we were doing can easily become a bitter memory, frustration,
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   maybe even anger because the only thing that compels us over and over again to go beyond
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.720]   what is natural, you know, God calls us to slap, you know, you get slapped on your left
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.760]   and then turn the other cheek and having slap, that's humanly impossible.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.200]   Jesus says that they're going to know that we are his disciples by the love that Jesus
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.980]   practiced on us.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.160]   Even in marriage, the marriage relationship is to reflect the love of Christ to his bride
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.760]   and his bride's submission to Christ.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.280]   So all of who we are, we are to reflect God's love.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.700]   So we love because he first loved us.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.200]   So yes, we are motivated at times by fear, we're motivated by shame, we're motivated
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.320]   by reward, but ultimately if the love of Christ is not compelling us, everything that we're
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.480]   doing eventually, at least from my observation, from my own personal experience, eventually
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.640]   becomes a bitter memory or we become discouraged or angry.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.140]   So Paul, the whole purpose before he gets to the imperatism, chapter four, he lays out
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.940]   how he pursued sinners, how he loved us, how he predestined us, how he made us his children.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.780]   And so basically what he's been doing is he's been laying out the love of Christ for three
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.180]   chapters and he concludes all of it by saying, "I presented this to you and I'm praying that
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.340]   you would comprehend through all of the things that God has done to you and for you and in
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.500]   you that you would understand the love of Christ.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.820]   You would understand the height, the depth, the width and length of the love of Christ
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.640]   together with all the saints.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.180]   And then as you comprehend the love of Christ, that you will be compelled to practice this
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.500]   love."
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.940]   All that we have been studying through the book of Romans and in particular the area
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.360]   that we're getting in at.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.820]   If we're not careful, we can study it and say, "Well, is it about Israel?
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.820]   Is it not about Israel?"
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.060]   And we're debating back and forth, you know, and you have some groups that say, "Well,
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.020]   it's not Israel, God has done, you know, the church is Israel."
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.900]   And then we can get it back and forth and every theological system and some churches
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.940]   obviously have their own opinions and I have my own opinion on this and I think I made
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.100]   that pretty clear.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.160]   But if we don't see the big picture behind this and what God is doing, I think we can
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.020]   just easily get entangled and learn a lot of theology and have a lot of opinions about
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.580]   things without really having the ultimate effect of why this is even in the scripture.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.100]   See, he's been trying to answer this question in the last few chapters, "Has God rejected
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.100]   his people?"
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.660]   And he says, "By no means."
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.180]   And again, in a more recent context, "Have they fallen as to not be able to be restored?"
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.060]   And again, he says, "By no means."
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.220]   Paul has been trying to answer this question, "Where does Israel fit into God's salvation
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.220]   plan?"
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.140]   If the gospel has been opened up to the Gentiles and if obedience to the law doesn't make
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.860]   them any closer to God, then what is the purpose of Israel?
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.860]   Is he done with them?
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.860]   He says, "By no means."
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.500]   Have they fallen where they can't get back up?
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.140]   He says, "By no means."
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.740]   Think carefully about why God established the nation of Israel in the first place.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.780]   Remember we go back to Genesis chapter 12, 1, 2, and 3, especially verse 3, he said he
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.660]   was going to bless them and through the nation of Israel, he was going to reach the rest
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.900]   of the world.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.980]   So Israel was to function as a holy priesthood.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.980]   They were mediators so that through the nation of Israel, by giving them the law, the sacrificial
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:41.140]   system, that through all of it, that God was going to be glorified.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:48.500]   If that was the purpose of the nation of Israel, humanly speaking, it was a miserable failure.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.100]   Because if God chose Israel to be a mediator and through their obedience and through their
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.380]   righteousness, somehow they were going to reflect on the glory of God, they failed utterly.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.540]   In fact, isn't that exactly what Paul says in Romans chapter 2?
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.740]   That because of you, the name of God is being blasphemed?
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.740]   Israel's history.
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.140]   We're not talking about hundreds of years later.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.860]   We're talking about as soon as, as soon as they are established, they're on the other
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.180]   side of the Red Sea and Moses is up in a mountain.
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.900]   The very first thing that they do is they go out and they create, they create, they
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.140]   create this, this idol, right?
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.780]   This golden calf.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.780]   And we're talking about the inception of the nation of Israel.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.780]   And that's not where it ends.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:40.060]   It begins there and all throughout the desert, they're constantly griping and complaining.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.060]   We should have went back.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.960]   Then they immediately forgot what God had done.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.580]   All the miracles, the power encounter that he had, how he saved them miraculous through
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.580]   the Red Sea.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.060]   And he was merciful with them.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.540]   They immediately, as soon as they get thirsty, they start to forget.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.180]   All throughout Israel's history, as soon as the kings get established, we're not talking
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.780]   about out of dozens of kings, we have half of them that were good and half of them that
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.780]   were bad.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.700]   There are only a handful, maybe even one hand.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:14.900]   The total number of kings that they had for hundreds and hundreds of years were all corrupt.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.760]   Every single one of them led the nation astray.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.560]   And as a result of that, God brings judgment upon them.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.980]   And even as he is judging them, he says, only if you would return.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.480]   So momentarily they would repent.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.160]   But ultimately in the large scheme of things, it was a record of Israel's failure after
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.280]   failure after failure after failure.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:43.720]   Even after they go into captivity, God shows them mercy and he establishes a king, King
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:50.280]   Cyrus, and uses him to allow the nation of Israel to come back and reestablish the temple.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.520]   And only a handful of them, a very small number of them, actually even come back.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.000]   The majority of them completely forgot about the covenant with God.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.720]   They got assimilated into Babylon and into Persia and they liked it there and they didn't
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.860]   want to risk going back.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.560]   So majority of the nation of Israel, even after the judgment of God, they just continue.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.760]   Again, record of failure over and over and over and over again.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.600]   And from the very beginning of the inception of the nation of Israel until the very last
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.880]   chapter of Malachi, it's a record of Israel's failure.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.140]   And I'm not just highlighting these bad things.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.720]   If you read through the Old Testament, that's what you see.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.880]   So when you first read it superficially, you say, "Wow, God is vengeful."
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.320]   But when you read it carefully, the historical background and how God is responding to them,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.520]   I think you'll come to the same conclusion that everybody comes to is, "Why is God so
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.880]   faithful to this nation?
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.800]   Why at some point you would think it's enough, but he says he's going to be faithful to his
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   covenant."
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.900]   So in every human angle, we have to say Israel failed.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:05.240]   If that was the case, and that's the question that Paul is trying to answer.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:11.720]   If God, if Israel was God's covenant people and they're just as standing, just as condemned
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.440]   as any Gentile, has God rejected his people?
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.200]   He says, "By no means."
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.720]   Have they fallen that they would not be restored?
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.680]   He says, "By no means."
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:32.080]   Romans 8, 28, Paul says in the earlier chapters that God works all together for good.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.200]   So even though in human record, we could say, "Well, God intended to be glorified to the
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.060]   nation of Israel, but they utterly failed.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.200]   So if they utterly failed, doesn't that mean that God has failed?"
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.640]   If that was God's plan and it didn't work out, it's over and over again that Israel,
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.440]   his handpicked chosen people did not bring glory.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.320]   Well, in Romans 11, 11, Paul says earlier, "So I asked, did they stumble in order that
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   they might fall?
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   By no means.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.560]   Rather, through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles."
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:15.240]   In other words, God is saying through Paul that the failure of Israel is a part of God's
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.420]   ultimate plan.
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.280]   That it was not plan B, that plan A failed, so now he's going to plan B and going to the
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   Gentiles.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.840]   He says, "It is exactly their failure through which God was going to be glorified."
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:34.520]   It was because they rejected Christ, now that was God's sovereign plan, that even through
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:41.800]   that, he was going to bring salvation to the Gentiles.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.680]   Humanly speaking, it's like, well, at least from what we see, it's like, well, I mean,
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.760]   his plan actually didn't work out, but all that Paul has been saying up to this point,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.920]   he's like, "No, it was always part of God's plan."
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.360]   Even though we may not fully comprehend and understand what God was doing, but now we
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.800]   look in retrospect, that's exactly what he ordained, and that's what he's been saying
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.760]   the last couple chapters.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.040]   So this morning, we're going to look at two things that Paul says, again, in these two
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.400]   short verses, I want to highlight certain things.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.800]   One, that God's perfect plan was fulfilled through the failure of Israel.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.880]   That it wasn't that because Israel failed that God went through another plan.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.040]   He had another plan to the Gentiles, and hopefully this time it works out.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.120]   Since Israel failed, hopefully the church won't fail.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.800]   That is not exactly what's going on.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.200]   God intended from the very beginning that through the failure of Israel, that he was
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.360]   going to fulfill his perfect plan.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.360]   In verse 13, it says, "I am speaking to you Gentiles."
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   I am speaking to you Gentiles.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:52.120]   Let me stop there and spend a little bit of time talking about what is his point here?
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.760]   We can get easily caught up and talk about, "Well, is it about the Jews, or is it about
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:01.360]   the church, or is it about the Gentiles, and what is his main point?"
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.680]   We can get so caught up into saying, "What does this have to say about me, about marriage,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   about singleness?"
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.560]   We kind of look to the scripture to see how all of these things are ultimately going to
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   fit for me.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:20.040]   I am not saying that that's wrong, but the ultimate author behind everything that we
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.280]   read is not you, and it is not me.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.840]   It is not the Gentiles, and it is not the Jews.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.760]   It is not Israel.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:38.040]   The author and the main character all throughout the scripture was never about you, and it
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   is not about me.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   It is not about the Jews.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   It is not about the church.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.360]   It is not about organizations.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.000]   It is not about our effort.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.320]   Ultimately it is to glorify God.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.600]   Who was the book of Romans written to?
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.520]   Was it to Jews or to Gentiles?
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520]   Just think to yourself.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.360]   You don't have to say it out loud.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.840]   So let me ask it another way.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.880]   The Roman church, were they predominantly Jews or Gentiles?
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   Just think it.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.160]   Don't say it, just in case I have to correct you.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.360]   Is it a Gentile church or a Jewish church?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.040]   It's a Gentile church.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.320]   Predominantly it is a Gentile church.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.120]   It is a Gentile area.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:34.280]   If you have been following us all the way from chapter 1 to where we are now, I am asking
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.920]   predominantly who is the letter addressed to?
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.400]   Predominantly.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   I am not saying that he speaks to both Jews and Gentiles, but who is he predominantly
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.720]   arguing to or about?
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   Who is it addressed to at least predominantly?
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.120]   Again, don't say it out loud.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.720]   I just want you to go back to your memory of what you heard, what you remember.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.000]   It is predominantly argument for the Jews because he says, "Well, the Gentiles are
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.920]   obviously, they have no excuse," but then he says, "So do you."
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.240]   And then he says, "Those who are under the law will be judged under the law.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.840]   Those who don't have the law will be judged without the law."
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.800]   And he says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.920]   Gentiles had no problem with that.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.120]   They already knew.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.680]   It was the Jews that he was trying to convince that you are also part of that condemnation.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.640]   And then he begins to explain what that means.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.680]   And so what was the point of the law?
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:38.160]   So he begins to explain the purpose of the law from chapter 5 on to chapter 7.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.640]   And so all of that is to explain what was God doing with the nation of Israel.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.920]   So we get chapter 8 where he said all of that culminates and says, "There is now no condemnation
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.440]   for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.480]   And he explains what the gospel accomplished in chapter 8 both to the Jews and to the Gentiles.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.120]   And then he comes back to the argument with the Jews between chapter 9, 10, and 11.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.360]   Then what about the Jews?
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.760]   And that's what we've been talking about in the last three chapters.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:11.700]   So predominantly, he is trying to explain what he's been doing with the Jews.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:19.120]   And yet in this text, and knowing the background of the Roman church, he's predominantly
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.040]   talking to the Gentiles.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   He says, "I am speaking now to the Gentiles, and as much then as I am to the apostle Gentile,
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.160]   I magnify my ministry in order that somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous and thus save
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   some of them."
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.680]   In fact, Paul's been saying this over and over again in Romans 1, 16.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.260]   He says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:45.360]   who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.280]   He's talking to predominantly Gentile church, and why even bring that up?
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:56.000]   It's almost like, "I love you, but I love them first."
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.160]   My salvation is for you, but those guys first.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.080]   Why even bring that up?
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.280]   Why stir them up like that?
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.400]   He's talking to the Gentiles and just say, "I love you, and I saved you."
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.920]   But he goes out of his way to make sure that they understand that it comes to the Jews
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.200]   first.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.840]   Jesus himself said of his ministry in Matthew 15, 24, he answered, "I was sent only to
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.620]   the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.720]   His intent was always to go to the Gentiles, but why limit himself in the three years?
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.200]   It's like, "Well, I'm just to the Gentiles."
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:35.800]   And predominantly, majority of his time and energy was for the house of Israel.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:41.000]   Again in John 4, 22, he makes it clear to the Samaritan woman.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.820]   He says, "You worship what you do not know.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.400]   You worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews."
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.200]   Now he's not saying that if you're a Jew, you're going to be saved.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.840]   He said, "First, the message of salvation came through the Jewish community."
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.040]   Again, let me read one more passage.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.760]   In Romans 2, verse 3, it says, "There will be tribulation and distress for every human
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.360]   being who does evil, the Jew first and also to the Greek."
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.520]   So he also works even the other way.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.320]   That condemnation and retribution will first come to the Jews because God's covenant people
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.120]   first started with the Jewish community.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.200]   And then he follows that up by saying, "But glory and honor, peace and everyone who does
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.360]   good, the Jew first and also to the Greek."
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.280]   There's two reasons why he does that.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:32.160]   One, he's basically warning the Gentiles that although that the gospel has come to you,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.800]   do not look down upon the Jewish people.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.960]   So that they would not become proud because now they have become that God's chosen, at
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.760]   least through the church.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.280]   But secondly, more importantly, he is reminding the Gentile church that God is not done with
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.120]   the nation of Israel.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.480]   He's not yet done with the nation of Israel.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.680]   You see, from the beginning to the end, ultimately, we may look at that and say, "Well, I mean,
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.600]   if he's not done with the nation, they're special people and we're kind of second-class
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.680]   citizen."
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.920]   The whole point of the gospel message from Genesis to Revelation is a revelation ultimately
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.960]   about himself, about who God is.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.320]   So everything that we know about God, everything that we can trust about God, every promise
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:29.920]   that God has made to us, first come through his faithfulness to the nation of Israel.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.500]   So the covenant that he made with Israel, his faithfulness to Israel, his anger toward
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:41.600]   their sin and judgment, and his faithfulness to forgive and to keep his covenant, all first
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:47.760]   and foremost, we see this with the nation of Israel.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.480]   You can't tell if somebody is faithful by just looking at them.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.720]   It's like, "Oh, you know, everybody who looks this way are faithful."
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.880]   We would never make that judgment.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.640]   If you apply for a job and they want to see if you're reliable, they always check your
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.640]   past.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.520]   What's your past record?
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.720]   What have you done?
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.960]   And they want to see some references, some other people who have observed you in the
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.560]   past.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:15.240]   Because you can only tell a faithfulness if somebody is reliable based upon the record
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.000]   that they have of their past.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.960]   You don't just look at them and say, "Oh, he's reliable, so I'm going to trust him."
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.280]   God's relationship with the nation of Israel, as I mentioned in the previous sermons, is
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   his resume.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.760]   And it is ultimately a revelation of himself.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.520]   And the reason why we can have confidence as a church to believe him and trust him is
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.080]   because his track record with the nation of Israel.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.400]   That everything that has happened with the nation of Israel, according to 1 Corinthians
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.360]   chapter 10, happened as an example for us to see what they went through, and we were
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.440]   to watch that, and it serves that purpose.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.280]   That's why Apostle Paul says, in the latter part of this, to you Gentiles, "Remember,
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.280]   it's not about you.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.040]   Ultimately, it's not even about the Jews.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.800]   It's about God."
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.880]   And he says, "I'm an apostle of the Gentiles.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.960]   I magnify my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous and thus save
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.600]   some of them."
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.320]   You have to remember, Apostle Paul, I mean, there's all kinds of ways to share the gospel,
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.320]   obviously.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.600]   But when we go to certain areas, I mean, you don't want to blow the horn, right?
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.760]   In fact, every time we go to India, because India is, the persecution meter is rising
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.320]   rapidly in India, so we're always cautious that we don't garner too much attention.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.200]   And so every year, I mean, we're going to go back again in January, but every year we're
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.280]   a bit more concerned because they know we're coming.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.960]   So we're trying to keep it down low.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.200]   So we go to certain areas where we're not going to gather attention, and I remember
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.520]   the first year we were there, we somehow got a reporter.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.600]   We didn't want that, but a reporter came, took pictures, and Sarah actually got on the
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   newspaper, and then we were kind of happy and not happy.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.960]   Happy that we had good press, not happy because we didn't want people to know.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.960]   See, Apostle Paul, everywhere he went, people were waiting for him.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.480]   And his fame began to spread, that this guy and his partners are going, and he's shaking
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.480]   up the world.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.520]   And Paul says he's deliberately magnifying his ministry.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.080]   He's deliberately doing it public so that people will know.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   He wants them to know he's coming.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.600]   He wants them to know what he's doing.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.420]   He's preaching it very vocally and publicly, even though that's also garnering all kinds
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.520]   of persecution, and they're waiting for him even before he comes to the city.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.320]   But he was doing that all with a specific purpose, because he never forgot about the
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   Jews.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.600]   You know, the question that he asked, "Is God done with the nation of Israel?"
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:58.820]   I'm pretty sure that Paul was probably the first one to ask that question.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:05.000]   This guy was so zealous for the nation of Israel, he was responsible for the first martyr
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.640]   in the church, Stephen.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.640]   He was responsible.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.760]   And to be responsible for the death of somebody, I mean, he could have been put into capital
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   punishment.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.680]   He was responsible for a lot of people, and he went all the way to Damascus, and he was
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.040]   willing to risk his safety and his life to go get after them, to beat them, put them
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   in jail, and drag them all the way back to Jerusalem.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.480]   I mean, he was zealous for his nation.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.500]   So on the way to Damascus, he gets thrown off of his horse, he sees Christ.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:41.320]   And so can you imagine for three days as he is blind, he must be thinking to himself that
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.360]   he was wrong?
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.200]   Have you ever been wrong about anything?
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:51.160]   He said, "No, I've never been wrong."
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.400]   You're wrong about that.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:00.640]   Maybe you had a certain view of somebody because of some certain things that you may have heard,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.280]   and you kind of had negative feelings toward that person, and then maybe after you spent
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.600]   time, got to know them, it's like, "Oh, I was completely wrong, and I feel bad about
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.600]   that."
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   Right?
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.320]   I mean, we've all had experiences where we've been wrong about something, and then you think
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.960]   about all the things that you said and done because you had a certain view, and then realized
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.880]   that you were wrong about it.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:28.320]   Can you imagine Apostle Paul, where he dedicated his life for the nation of Israel?
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.000]   That's why the Pharisees were committed to keep the law, because they thought that by
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.320]   keeping the law, it was going to garner God's favor, and then when God favors them, they're
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.280]   going to be elevated to be a superpower.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.900]   So that's why he was willing to give his life for his nation.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:48.360]   So now, all of a sudden, Christ appears in his life, and probably for those three days,
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.640]   he was thinking, "I was wrong?
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.240]   The gospel's now going to the Gentiles?"
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:01.460]   So I bet you, the first person who asked that question, before Paul ever put it in this
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.840]   letter to the Romans, was him.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.480]   If I was wrong, are you done with Israel then?
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.720]   That means not just me, that all of my friends, maybe my parents, my closest friends, the
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.760]   whole Sanhedrin, all the Pharisees, Phariseic friends that I had, that we were all wrong,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.080]   are you done with Israel?
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.800]   Have we fallen that we cannot get up?
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:36.760]   My guess is, if not by those very words, but Jesus himself probably answered Paul exactly
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:44.080]   the same way that Paul is stating it here, "By no means."
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.120]   You know, today, people use the term all the time, "God told me to do this, God told me
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   to do that."
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.100]   How do you know God told you to do that?
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.440]   Sometimes it could just be your feeling.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.280]   Maybe you should take a nap, you know what I mean?
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.360]   Or get some rest, and you're getting all kinds of thoughts and feelings in your head.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.160]   You say, "God told me to do this, and then all of a sudden, a year later, God told me
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   to do something else."
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.000]   So we use that very loosely.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.920]   I mean, the only way that we know for sure God told you to do something is written in
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.000]   his inerrant word.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Everything else, you're guessing.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.760]   And most of the time, it's probably not.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.200]   But Apostle Paul had direct communication with Christ.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.000]   He was giving him revelation.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.280]   Christ spoke to him audibly.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.800]   And this revelation was coming to Paul.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.200]   So my guess is the first person that he, that question that Paul would have had was, "Not
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.560]   only am I wrong, have we all been wrong?
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.320]   Are you done with Israel?"
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.880]   Maybe not those very words, but the first answer is, "By no means."
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.280]   It wasn't that God was moving on for the nation of Israel.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.820]   It's just the way that they understood how the blessing was going to come to them.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.120]   So Paul never forgot about his countrymen.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.680]   He says it over and over again.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.960]   If it was up to me, I would choose to be accursed rather than them.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.680]   That's how many he loved his nation.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.960]   He says he had great sorrow in chapter 9, verse 2.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:16.280]   He says he is constantly praying his heart's desire for them to be saved.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.240]   Paul never forgot about the nation of Israel.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:25.420]   Paul knew from the very get-go that his purpose of sending him to Gentiles wasn't to forsake
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.520]   the nation of Israel.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.500]   It was even in that that God was going to use him to stir up jealousy, to bring some
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.880]   of his countrymen back to repentance.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.240]   So what does that tell us?
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:43.620]   That to the very end, God is faithful to his covenant to his own people.
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.860]   Remember the parable of the prodigal son?
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.340]   The parable of the prodigal son ends with a rebuke to the older brother.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.820]   He's not talking to the son.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.380]   He's talking to the older brother because he was hanging around with the tax collectors
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.980]   and he said, "Why are you spending so much time with these sinners?"
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.180]   And so Jesus turns it around and tells three parables.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:09.660]   The first parable is a 99 sheep and going after the one, the lost coin and how they
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:15.340]   celebrate and then as a conclusion to these parables, he gives the parable of the prodigal
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.980]   son.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.620]   And you guys know the prodigal son story well.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.780]   He takes his dad's inheritance, he goes and he wastes it all and he comes back and dad
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:30.140]   comes and celebrates and has a huge party for him and then the older brother is behind
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.660]   the scene and what is older brother doing?
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.700]   What is he doing?
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.580]   He is jealous.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.620]   That's the scene that is pictured for us by Christ and the prodigal son.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:49.420]   The older brother is in the background watching what his father is doing to the prodigal son,
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.900]   killing a calf and celebrating and embracing him, kissing him, loving him and the older
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.900]   brother is jealous.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.620]   I've been here all this time faithful but you've never killed a calf for me but this
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:05.620]   guy blows all the inheritance and he comes back and you're just going to bring him right
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.860]   in?
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:16.900]   That whole story was about the older brother, to stir in him and to rebuke him for his bad
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.780]   attitude toward the Gentiles.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:26.220]   Now we know that the story doesn't end with his jealousy turning into repentance because
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:32.420]   jealousy could either turn to rejection or jealousy can turn to pursuit.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:38.340]   And so Paul is saying here is that through this ministry, through the prodigal son and
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:44.140]   he's doing it publicly because this is what God told him, because what Jesus told him
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.260]   that he's not done with the nation of Israel.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:55.620]   Do you see the heart of our God in the way he deals with this covenant people?
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:01.140]   Do you see his perseverance with these people?
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.220]   At what point would you give up on a friend?
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:12.340]   At what point would you give up on your partner?
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:17.260]   At what point would you draw the line and say it's enough?
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.340]   I'm done taking abuse from these friends.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.140]   At what point?
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.860]   Every one of us has a line.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.680]   You cross this line, we're done.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:38.500]   Look at the way our Father deals with his covenant people.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.940]   Every part of their history, they're blaspheming his name, they're turning around and every
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.740]   time they get thirsty, it's like, "Who are you?
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.580]   You're not good to us."
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.400]   He sends prophets, they kill them.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:57.160]   And if that wasn't enough, he sends his only begotten son and they crucify him.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.060]   At some point you would think that God would say, "You know, I know I made a covenant with
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.660]   you, but man, I chose the wrong people.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:13.540]   I know I told you that you're the apple of my eye, but man, that is enough."
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:20.660]   But even as Paul is writing this letter, even as he's being stoned and put into prison,
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.980]   he had every intention to come to Rome.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:30.280]   But he comes to Rome in chains eventually.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.820]   You see the way our God deals with his people?
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.940]   It is not about Israel.
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.740]   It is not about Gentiles.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.940]   Ultimately, it was always about him.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.980]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 1, 15, 17, "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance,
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:55.020]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.700]   Not the lovely, not the ones with potential, but sinners.
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:04.500]   And I want you to just take a minute to meditate on that because we know this passage so well.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.380]   Sinners.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:12.140]   It's very romantic to say, "Oh, you know, the God of the universe came down and saved
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:17.400]   sinners and walked among us because we think we're the sinners."
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.300]   Have you ever been sinned against?
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:25.980]   Has somebody wronged you so deeply?
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.400]   You're disgusted.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.060]   Is there any sin that you can think of that you can't stand to even be around that person,
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.180]   let alone even talk about it?
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:41.780]   Because when you and I think of sin, we think of sin in the context of my sin.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.700]   What we can tolerate.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.780]   But when you think about sin itself, the ugliness of sin, the depth of sin, the grotesqueness
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.740]   of sin.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:33:00.340]   And he says, "God demonstrates his own love toward us and that while we are yet sinners."
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.700]   Think about the grotesquest things.
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.840]   Think about the most harsh things that somebody has ever done to you.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.000]   And think about sin in that context.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.420]   And he says, "He came into the world seeking sinners."
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.860]   What is your natural response to sin?
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.540]   When somebody sins against you or you see something grotesque, what is your natural
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.540]   response?
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:27.300]   Oh man, I do everything in my power to stay away from them.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.420]   I remember when I was in the Philippines through Compassion and I shared with you, I was at
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.940]   a hotel and there were these old men in 50s and 60s hanging around with teenage Filipino
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.940]   girls.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.300]   Eventually we found out that they were there because of sex trafficking.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.420]   And so the young girls were giving their bodies because they needed to pay bills and they
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:50.460]   needed to help out their family and these old men were coming in bus loads in the middle
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.420]   of nowhere so that they can have sexual relations with these girls.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:00.500]   And the guys are just dancing around getting drunk and me and a bunch of pastors were in
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.060]   the room and they were joking around, "Hey, you guys want to come party with us?"
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:10.900]   And when we found out what was going on, I remember we were stepped into a small elevator
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.260]   and he must have been maybe in his mid-60s with it.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:18.380]   She must have been no more than 14, 15 years old, my daughter's age.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:24.180]   And he was dancing, living it up and she was there quiet and he was turning around saying,
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.420]   "Hey, you guys want to party with us?"
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:32.380]   And I remember just five or six of us standing in that room and had to do everything in our
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:39.460]   power to restrain ourselves from just reaching out and grabbing this guy because we were
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.980]   so disgusted by what he was doing.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:49.100]   And after he left, after he walked out with this girl, we were in the elevator just looked
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:54.620]   at ourselves and just inflamed with anger.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.460]   And all of us just, "Oh my gosh."
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.460]   Because we were this close just grabbing this guy and just putting him on the ground, just
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.460]   pummeling him.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.140]   I mean, we're pastors so we can't do that, right?
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:16.500]   But we all felt the same thing, the disgusting revelation of sin.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:22.300]   We think about sin, we think about us, mistakes that we've made.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.020]   Sin encompasses all of that.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:32.740]   So if that's grotesque to a sinful man who's also a sinner, imagine how filthy that is
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:40.020]   in the hands and eyes of a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:48.740]   Imagine if we look at the sins of Israel and how we are frustrated with their sins.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:55.540]   Imagine what God must be feeling, a holy, holy, holy God who puts up with them over
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:00.180]   and over and has loved them over and over again and yet even to his only begotten Son
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.740]   they don't recognize and they crucify him.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:09.260]   See, it wasn't about me, it wasn't about Israel.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:15.580]   God received glory even in their failure because in their failure God is magnified.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.700]   This saying is trustworthy and disturbing of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:23.980]   into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost but I receive mercy for this
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:31.180]   reason that in me the foremost Jesus Christ may display his perfect patience as an example
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.620]   to those who are to believe in him for eternal life.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:40.500]   He was chosen because he was a grotesque sinner.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:46.580]   He says in order that those who come after him may say if God can forgive him then he
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.020]   can forgive me.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.140]   If God can pursue a sinner like him then he can forgive me.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.340]   He wasn't chosen because he was smart.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.060]   He wasn't chosen because he was a member, possibly a member of the Sanhedrin or Pharisee
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.380]   among Pharisees.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.700]   And that's what he means in Philippians chapter 3.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:11.540]   If you want to compare human righteousness, Hebrew among Hebrews, the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.740]   as to the law perfect, as to zeal persecuting the church, you want to go head to head but
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:25.100]   in light of surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ all of that became rubbish.
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.460]   It wasn't about Israel.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.220]   It's about Christ.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:38.060]   The only person that comes out clean from Genesis to Revelation is not the prophets,
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:49.820]   it's not the kings, it's not Israel, it's not even Apostle Paul, and it's not the church.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.100]   Christ and Christ alone is magnified through redemptive history.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:38:02.540]   It was always about Christ, not you, it's not me.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:08.340]   See his miracle and what he has done is nothing short of raising someone from the dead and
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.380]   that's my second point.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.020]   Only God's mercy can raise the dead.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.100]   He says in 15, "For their rejection means reconciliation of the world.
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.420]   What will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?"
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.940]   Do you remember 2 Samuel chapter 12?
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:28.300]   That as a result of David's sin, that Bathsheba is pregnant and God says as a result that
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.080]   the child is not going to live.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:36.180]   So the child becomes sick and for seven days David is fasting and praying and he is urging
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.040]   God to forgive his sins and to restore him.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.600]   After seven days he dies.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:50.320]   And to the surprise of his men, David just gets up, washes up and then he just goes back
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.720]   to normal life and so they're like, "What's going on?
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.980]   You were begging God for seven days, what happened?"
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.340]   And this is how he answers, 2 Samuel 12, 22.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.400]   He said, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.200]   For I said, 'Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me that the child may live?'
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.700]   But now he is dead, so why should I fast?
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.320]   Can I bring him back again?
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   I shall go to him but he will not return to me."
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.180]   In other words, what David is saying is he's dead.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.620]   As long as he lives, I had some hope.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.800]   But now that he's dead, I can go to him but he won't come to me.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.880]   In other words, I can die but he can't be brought back to life.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   So what's the point?
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.560]   In other words, there's no hope.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:42.620]   That's exactly how the Bible describes our state.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.540]   We weren't just struggling in our sins.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:50.200]   We weren't just holding on to a small thin red line.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:55.780]   He says we were dead in our trespasses.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:01.540]   We can't possibly will ourselves to get to God.
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.000]   Think how hard it is to change yourself.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.900]   Those of you who like chocolate, how many of you guys like chocolate?
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.900]   A lot of you.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.440]   A lot of you like chocolate.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.320]   From today, stop liking chocolate.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   Hope you succeed.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.640]   How many of you guys are morning people?
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.880]   Stop being morning people.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   Start being night people.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   Stay up late.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   How many of you are night people?
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   Stop.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   It's better if you wake up in the morning.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.960]   How many of you are introverts?
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   Stop it.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.960]   Just be extroverts from now on.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.960]   You need to make some friends.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   Go out there and mingle with people.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:42.000]   How many of you are extroverts?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.200]   Stop it.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.520]   Stop talking so much.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.840]   Give other people an opportunity.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.480]   Think about even these trivial things.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.640]   Even just the appetite of we like sugar or we like it spicy or don't like it spicy.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.080]   Just like, okay, I'm just going to change.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:07.920]   Imagine how difficult that is to change something as trivial as what you like to eat.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:14.600]   To possibly think a man who is dead in his trespass all of a sudden had the will to seek
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:19.240]   God out is just ludicrous.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.640]   It says we were dead in our trespasses.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.760]   Now all of us have different testimonies.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.280]   Some of you guys had radical testimonies.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:34.680]   Maybe you were a former gangster and all the youth could retreat skits were about you.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:39.520]   Most of us, our testimonies is like, "I don't have a great testimony."
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.640]   I would raise up in the church and I didn't know Christ.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.680]   At some point, the gospel began to make sense, so I decided to take my faith seriously and
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.440]   I began to learn and grow.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.960]   I can't pinpoint exactly what day, but it was sometime between 18 and 19.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   It just kind of happened.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   I know I'm saved.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:59.600]   I can't pinpoint exactly where it is and I don't really have anything to share.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:08.080]   Whether you have a radical testimony, at least you think it's radical or you think it's mundane,
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:15.060]   every single one of us came back from the dead.
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.520]   Every single one of us.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:23.080]   The fact that you were able to hear the Word of God and make sense, I didn't open those
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.200]   ears.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.960]   You didn't open those ears.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.760]   Your parents didn't open their ears.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.480]   You didn't will yourself to open it.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.500]   There was a miracle that happened.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:37.240]   We were once dead in our trespasses and He made us alive and that's exactly what He
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   says.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:43.120]   He brought us back from the dead, so there is no mundane testimony.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.680]   It's just that you don't realize what happened.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.760]   There is no average testimony.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.880]   Every single person, whether you were raised in the church, whether you can pinpoint it
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   or not pinpoint it, every single one of us came back from the dead because of Christ.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:04.880]   Ephesians 2.4, "But God being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:12.320]   us even when we were dead in our trespasses made us alive together with Christ."
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.640]   You know, this was all prophesied for the nation of Israel.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:20.440]   If you can put that verse up, Ezekiel chapter 37, and it's a long passage but I want to
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.920]   read this to you as I wrap up this morning.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:29.240]   God prophesied to the nation of Israel long before He ever even says this in this verse,
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   in verse 15.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:36.600]   "The hand of the Lord was upon me," and this is Ezekiel talking, "and He brought me out
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.520]   in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:44.680]   It was full of bones and He led me around among them and behold, there were very many
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.080]   on the surface of the valley and behold, they were very dry.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.760]   And He said to me, 'Son of man, can these bones live?'
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.480]   And I answered, 'O Lord God, you know.'
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.760]   Then He said to me, 'Prophesy over these bones and say to them, "Dry bones, hear the word
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   of the Lord."
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:03.600]   Thus says the Lord God of these bones, "Behold, I will cause breath to enter you and you shall
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.400]   live and I will lay sinews upon you and will cause flesh to come upon you and cover you
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.560]   with skid and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord."
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.520]   There's two things I want to point out here.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:22.400]   God shows this scene to Ezekiel to prophesy about what He will do in the future to the
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.640]   nation of Israel, but there's two things here.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.840]   One, He says, "These dry bones, there's no flesh."
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.440]   He's not dealing with somebody who just passed away, the resuscitated.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.060]   We're talking about all he has is skeleton.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.060]   There's nothing.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.740]   There's absolutely no hope.
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.940]   If David didn't have hope because his son died, I can go to him, he can't come to me.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:47.400]   He's looking at a body that's already decomposed and all that is left is bones.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.480]   And God says to Ezekiel, "I am the Lord of these bones."
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.560]   And then He prophesied, "I'm going to put the flesh back and eventually I'm going to
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.120]   put the breath back."
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.160]   And then when that happens, what does He say at the end?
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:04.360]   "Then you shall know that I am the Lord."
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:09.560]   This was not by chance, this was not by human effort, this was not because something else
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.560]   happened.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.600]   He says, "I am the Lord."
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.960]   If you've ever read through the book of Ezekiel, next time I encourage you to take a marker
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:23.000]   and mark every time God says, "I do this so that you may know that I am the Lord your
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   God."
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.480]   Or some form of that.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.440]   "I do this that you may know that I am the Lord your God."
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:36.240]   So you're going to find out the whole book of Ezekiel's theme is for God to reveal Himself.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.880]   And so His judgment and His mercy and patience toward the nation of Israel, all of it is
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.900]   so that they may know that the Lord God, that He is the Lord God.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.560]   Over and over again.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.300]   He tells Ezekiel that this is what's going to happen.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:58.880]   So Ezekiel goes ahead and obeys and says in verse 7, "So I prophesied as I was commanded,
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:03.680]   and as I prophesied, there was a sound and behold, a rattling and the bones came together,
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.920]   bone to its bones.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.800]   And I looked and behold, there were sinews on them and flesh come upon them and skin
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.680]   and covered them, but there was no breath in them.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.920]   Then He said to me, 'Prophesy to breathe, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath,
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:22.480]   'Thus says the Lord God, "Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain,
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.080]   that they may live."
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.040]   So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.160]   stood on their feet an exceedingly great army."
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:39.600]   So exactly as God said, this happens and then God explains what He is doing in verse 11
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   and on.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:45.720]   He said to them, "To me, son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   Behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope is lost.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.160]   We are cleanly cut off.'"
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.040]   In other words, there's absolutely no hope.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.760]   Israel was the dry bones, not just fallen down, not just without breath.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   There's no flesh on it.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.880]   It's just bones, completely hopeless.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.240]   "Therefore, prophesy and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God, 'Behold, I will open your
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:14.080]   graves and raise you up from your grave, O my people, and I will bring you into the land
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:18.580]   of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord when I open your graves and raise you
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.460]   from your graves, O my people.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.180]   And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.500]   own land.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.060]   Then you shall know that I am the Lord.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.020]   I have spoken, and I will do it,' declares the Lord."
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:38.620]   Israel's history is God allowing their sin to become utterly sinful and they come to
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.860]   a point where all they are are dry bones.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.740]   There's no hope left for Israel.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:49.900]   And God had prophesied hundreds and hundreds of years before.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:55.100]   Paul ever said this, that this is exactly what he was going to do.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:05.260]   When Israel has absolutely no hope, when all they are are dry bones, he said, "I will restore
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.260]   them.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:11.060]   I'll put flesh back on them, and I will breathe life back into them."
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.060]   Why?
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.620]   Because then you will know that I am the Lord.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:20.660]   It wasn't Israel's righteousness, it wasn't Israel's hard work, it wasn't something about
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.660]   Israel, because God.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:28.260]   Because He said He was going to do it.
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:33.200]   Israel as a nation disappears off the face of the earth in AD 70.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.300]   For 2,000 years they're gone.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.500]   And May 14th, 1948, they come back to their land.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   It's unheard of.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.180]   Just humanly speaking, it's unheard of.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.300]   Now, their restoration is not complete.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.340]   The gospel is being preached.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:53.740]   And as the prophecy says, one day there's going to be a mass conversion of the Jews.
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:49:01.460]   But just the fact that they have been restored in their flesh, the breath is not in there
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.460]   yet.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.940]   Remember, there were two stages of the way that God restored this dry bone.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.380]   He put the flesh back on, and He said, "Well, they're not breathing yet."
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.820]   But He said He's going to eventually bring the breath back in.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:14.300]   And so Israel has the flesh, they don't have the breath yet.
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:19.300]   This was all prophesied.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.980]   All of it, not about Israel.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.540]   It's not about the church.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.540]   It's not about you.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.620]   It's not about me.
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:32.420]   Our confidence is in Christ and Him alone.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:38.700]   If you've been a Christian long enough, you've probably been disappointed with other Christians.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.700]   Don't nod your head, because we know already.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.100]   People have disappointed you.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:51.820]   If you've been a Christian long enough, leaders have disappointed you.
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:56.940]   If you've been a Christian long enough, churches have disappointed you.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.780]   If you've been a Christian long enough, maybe the whole Christian community you've lost
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.780]   hope for.
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:08.860]   Again, if you've been a Christian long enough, even longer than that, even movements have
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.420]   disappointed you.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.420]   So you have various stages.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.740]   Depending on how long you've been a Christian, there's various stages of what you've been
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.020]   disappointed by.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:22.540]   And that's where you are, and I assume all of us to different degrees have experienced
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.180]   that, good.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:31.100]   Because our confidence should have never been on man to begin with.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.100]   It was never about me.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.020]   It was never about you.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.500]   It's never about a church.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:41.740]   It was never about a movement or a particular generation or a group of people.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:48.100]   All of it is so that you and I may know that there is one Lord.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:53.060]   And He's the only one who can resuscitate the dead.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:57.740]   Let me conclude with this, because as I was reading this and as I was preparing for the
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:03.220]   sermon and I think about this friend that I had back in high school.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:09.300]   I think I mentioned it to him a few of you, but I've lost contact with him after we graduated
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.500]   in freshman year.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.180]   He went his way and I went my way, and we lost contact.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:19.020]   And about a few years ago, I got contacted through Facebook.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.940]   It was a mutual friend saying, "Hey, you know, Peter," and so we were talking and so we met
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.900]   and had lunch.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.100]   And I found out that he became a Christian.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:33.580]   And so both him and I were like, "You're a pastor?"
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:38.020]   And then I found out he's a deacon of a large church nearby, and he became a very successful
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.020]   businessman.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.700]   So he has two factories here.
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:44.180]   He's got business out in Israel.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.460]   He's got a factory out in Turkey and Hong Kong.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.980]   So he's always traveling, but he's responsible for mission work.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.300]   So he's always taking people, he's always trying to get me to come with him to do missions.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.900]   So we get together, and every time we get together, I just dumbfound it, because the
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:02.960]   last time I met him, he got kicked out of Kennedy High School for selling drugs.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.840]   And so that was my last remembrance of him.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.680]   So we became good friends.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.500]   And so we used to go around, like we started to do business together.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.900]   So his dad owned some plastic bag factory, so we used to take whatever was misprinted
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:19.820]   and to walk out in South Central and areas where they have small markets, and we would
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.500]   go sell bags.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.560]   So this is when we were 18, 19 years old.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.820]   So that's my last remembrance of him.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:33.700]   And this guy would always have a, like his trunk would always be filled with alcohol.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:38.180]   I think his dad owned a liquor store too, and I think that's why maybe he had it.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:41.820]   But it was always, so anytime he wanted a drink, he'd just pop up his trunk and would
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.220]   just drink and put it back.
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.220]   And pretty sure it was illegal back then too.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.780]   I'm not sure, right?
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.620]   It was illegal back then.
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.660]   That was my last remembrance of him.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:54.700]   And then so all of a sudden, we haven't seen each other over 20 some years and we get together,
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.540]   and I'm a pastor and as a deacon of a church doing all kinds of missions.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.300]   And even now, I mean, this is several years ago, but even now, every time we get together,
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:09.900]   I'm just looking at him and saying, "Oh my gosh, you're a drug dealer."
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.380]   He's probably looking at me, he's like, "You're a pastor?
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.700]   I remember you."
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:23.340]   Every time I think about that, it's, humanly speaking, how could that be possible?
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.660]   Humanly speaking, how could that be possible?
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:27.660]   How can we buy our own efforts?
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:32.100]   Like, you know, I just decided to just shape up and give my life, and I just decided to
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.740]   be a better person.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.660]   And that's where I came.
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.740]   Both of us experienced a miracle.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.420]   Only the mercy of God.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:47.660]   Only the Lord Jesus Christ can raise somebody from the dead.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.340]   Everything that Paul has been saying here, even though we talk about the nation of Israel,
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:56.980]   in the end, our hope is found in nothing less.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.660]   Amen?
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:04.060]   If you've been disappointed because you've placed your hope in something else, maybe
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:07.740]   that's where you've gone wrong.
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:16.340]   Maybe living with dissatisfaction, discouragement, maybe that's where you've gone wrong.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.640]   Christ and Christ alone.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.860]   As we invite our praise team to come up, again, I want to invite you to take some time to
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:27.500]   pray and earnestly seek the Lord.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:31.260]   You know, I can give these messages and give broad strokes about we want to follow Christ,
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.740]   but I want to really encourage you to think specifically in application, right?
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:42.700]   If I'm pursuing things that is causing me to drift from Christ, what is it in your life
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.700]   that's causing you to take your eyes off of Him?
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.980]   Specifically, what is it that you're doing?
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.780]   What is it that you're not doing?
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:52.860]   Now I want you to take some time to pray and come before the Lord in earnest prayer as
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:53.860]   our worship team leads us.
