[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   What if this life is really vanity?
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.700]   What if this life, all of our work and our homework
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.280]   and our loves and our friendships and our activities
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.040]   and everything that we spend so much time consumed with,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.040]   what if it's all really pointless in the end?
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.160]   It's a question that comes to us
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.400]   from a listener named Blake.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.260]   Hello, Pastor John, I was wondering
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.200]   if it's possible to be saved and also to be a nihilist.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000]   There is a big part of me that just feels
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.480]   like nothing in life really matters.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.320]   Everything is just temporary anyway,
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.280]   is the end result for everyone is death.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.000]   But at the same time, I don't feel like Christ
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.880]   would want me to feel that way.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.360]   I do though, and I'm not sure what to think about it.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.960]   Thank you for your help.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   That word comes from the Latin nihil, that means nothing.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.040]   So the idea is that everything amounts to nothing.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.040]   Wikipedia and I checked two or three dictionaries
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.700]   and encyclopedias of philosophy,
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.020]   and this is the simplest, says,
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.800]   most commonly nihilism is presented
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.140]   in the form of existential nihilism,
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.280]   which argues that life is without objective meaning,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.840]   purpose or intrinsic value.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.000]   Moral nihilists assert that morality
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.920]   does not inherently exist,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.120]   and that any established moral values
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.680]   are abstractly contrived, end of quote.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.240]   Now, given both those definitions,
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.740]   it is obvious that they are contrary
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.580]   to what the Bible teaches
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.720]   and what Christianity has meant for 2000 years.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.860]   God does give meaning and purpose
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.600]   and value to human existence.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.940]   He himself is the ultimate value,
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.780]   and his purpose gives meaning to life.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.040]   His holiness defines what is good and beautiful,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   so that morality does inherently exist,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.340]   and moral values are not merely abstractly contrived.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.280]   So nihilism is the opposite
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.920]   of what the Bible reveals to be true,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.820]   and to embrace nihilism as true
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.480]   would necessarily mean rejecting
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.440]   what the Bible presents as truth about God and Christ
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.920]   and their purposes for the world,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.600]   and that rejection would mean
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.300]   that a person would be choosing
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.320]   to reject God's offer of salvation.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.040]   But I can't bring myself to believe
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.500]   that Blake was asking something so obvious.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.680]   (laughs)
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.560]   I mean, he says, "Can you be a nihilist and be saved?"
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080]   I mean, the answer seems so obvious to me.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.520]   I don't think he means that merely.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.040]   Here's his own definition, what he's talking about.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.960]   Quote, "There's a big part of me
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   "that just feels like nothing in life really matters.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   "Everything is just temporary anyways.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.080]   "The end result for everyone is death."
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.400]   So here's Blake's definition of nihilism.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.480]   One, it feels like nothing matters.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.400]   Two, everything is temporary.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.960]   Three, because the end result is death for everybody.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.160]   So let me respond objectively, biblically,
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.560]   just very briefly to each one with a bullet,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.640]   and then turn around and get at what I think the issue is.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.220]   Namely, he says it feels like this.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.240]   Number one, it feels like nothing matters.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.280]   Actually, Blake, everything matters,
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.920]   because God created everything with a purpose.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.560]   Proverbs 16, four, "The Lord made everything for its purpose,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.800]   "even the wicked for the day of trouble."
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.880]   Number two, he says everything is temporary.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.740]   No, Blake, it's not.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.160]   Paul says, "The things that are seen are temporary,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.120]   "but the things that are unseen are eternal."
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.780]   That means you and me, you never met a temporary person.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.180]   They all live forever.
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.900]   Life is infinitely significant.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.900]   Number three, he says, "The end result is for everyone death."
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.020]   Blake, no, it's not.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.060]   Hebrews 9, 27 says, "It is appointed for man to die
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.820]   "once and after that comes judgment."
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.980]   Death is not the end for anyone.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.980]   So my last response is, what about Blake's feeling?
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.880]   What he says is, "There's a big part of me
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.120]   "that just feels this way."
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.120]   And my response to this is,
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.120]   it is possible, Blake, to feel this way and be saved
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.800]   if you don't stay feeling this way.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.200]   Feelings are fickle, and they can become deep,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.420]   settled positions that destroy you.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.900]   Satan may have shot a fiery arrow
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.240]   of doubt and disillusionment at you.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.320]   It lodged in your mind and your heart.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.240]   God allowed it in order to test you.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.020]   So fight through the feeling.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.480]   Confess it to God, admit it, hate it.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.180]   Set yourself against it.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.700]   Pray that God would deliver you from it,
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.060]   and then immerse yourself in the truth,
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.040]   because there is another feeling in you.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.960]   You said so, you said, "I don't feel like Christ
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.760]   "would want me to feel this way."
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.220]   Well, that's good, that's good.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.300]   That's real competition in your heart,
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.920]   and it didn't come from the devil.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.500]   No, he wouldn't.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.220]   Christ wouldn't want you to feel this way,
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.620]   and he is not arbitrary in what he wants.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.300]   He has his reasons, and he wants to give them to you.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.300]   So give yourself no rest until you find Christ's reasons
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.780]   for not being a nihilist.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.740]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John,
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.800]   and thank you for the open and honest question, Blake.

[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.220]   We'll find out on Friday.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
