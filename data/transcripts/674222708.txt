[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   Like many others, I grew up in a Christian household, went to every Sunday service, and
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.960]   was spoon-fed who God is.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.440]   And during my childhood, I never questioned it.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.400]   I was actually baptized twice in my life prior, once when I was four and my second time at
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.400]   12.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.280]   Although my childhood church had genuine intentions in asking me if I wanted to get baptized,
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.960]   I agreed mostly because it was routine once you reach middle school to do so.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.800]   I said I accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior, but I didn't understand the gravity of it,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.960]   and there was no indication of true belief in my life.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.400]   This continued up to my junior year of high school when my parents decided to leave the
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.360]   church we were at and start a church plant.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.720]   This was the first time I started seeing the church in a different light because other
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.640]   brothers and sisters started spreading rumors about my family, and I felt so confused and
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640]   angry.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.040]   I realized I started holding grudges against them, and I thought it would be better for
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.640]   me to leave.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.120]   I began looking for other churches, but realized I only really went to church for friends,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.160]   so I decided that I would find one when I got to college.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.000]   When God sovereignly brought me to UCI, I started the search again, but without knowing
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.400]   what I was exactly looking for.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.920]   In my freshman year, I thought if I chose to go to church on my own, then I must be
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.800]   a Christian because it was the first time I was going without parental pressure.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.560]   I found Berean during the first week of school, joined a fellowship in small group, but started
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.440]   living a double life whenever I went back to the dorms.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.640]   I wanted that worldly college experience with my non-believing roommates, and I didn't
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.720]   feel like I fit in a church.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.640]   Instead of realizing it was about my own heart, I church hopped for two years hoping to find
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.280]   a community to fit in.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.080]   It wasn't until the summer before my junior year that I read the gospel according to Jesus
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.080]   with a friend.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.560]   Through the Holy Spirit working through her and a lot of hard-hitting questions, this
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.120]   thought came to mind.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.520]   I can't say that I love the Lord and believe in him without it feeling like a lie.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.080]   That summer, I prayed desperately every night for the Lord to take away the things I was
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.600]   holding onto in this world, whether it be school, family, or my health, if it causes
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.680]   me to truly know who he is.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.560]   By God's grace, I was led back to Berean where I was able to get plugged in and join a small
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.560]   group again.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.880]   However, during this whole time, I was still questioning if I was saved.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.040]   Even in my prayers, I was struggling with humbling myself and understanding what it
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040]   meant to trust in him.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.720]   Fast forward to the beginning of the pandemic, I started feeling like my life was falling
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   apart.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.520]   There were rumors of the rest of the school year going online.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.720]   I was dealing with some health issues, as were my grandparents.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.800]   I also failed a class that meant I likely would have to take another year or even change
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   my major.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.360]   Amidst all this happening, I was stressfully praying and the Lord reminded me about what
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.720]   I had lifted up to him the summer before.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.280]   He was answering that prayer and showing me that all situations he allows in my life are
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.080]   for my good.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.160]   It was at this point I came to the word and I read through Psalm 65, 4.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.320]   How blessed is the one whom you choose and bring near to you to dwell on your courts.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.120]   We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.640]   That night on March 7th, 2020, when I read this verse, I felt this heaviness come upon
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.760]   me and I remember being like, wow, God chose me to bring near to him.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.360]   I was jumping around in my living room with the realization that I accepted Jesus Christ
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.520]   as my savior and was saved.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.960]   Although at the moment all I felt was pure joy, after coming to salvation, it was then
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.840]   that I began to better understand my true nature as a sinner before a holy God.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.200]   Both when looking back at his grace, through these experiences and in my daily life, it
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.240]   reminds me of how undeserving I am of anything he has given me, but most importantly, how
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.080]   undeserving I am of Christ's death and resurrection.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.680]   For someone that has taken advantage of his love and rejected him so many times, I am
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.280]   in awe of his mercy and the true joy I have found in him.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.480]   God has used that time since then to test my faith and show me a lot of the sins in
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.480]   my heart as well.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.320]   And one of them was my fear of man, especially in the fear of getting baptized and therefore
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.840]   my inability to participate in communion.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.640]   I was rebuked that delayed obedience is still disobedience.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.520]   There are still so many lessons that I feel like God is teaching me in this weird period
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.360]   post-grad, but I'm continually reminded how I can't do anything without depending on him.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   Thank you.
