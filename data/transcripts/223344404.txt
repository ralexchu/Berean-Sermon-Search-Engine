[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   Let's pray first before we get into the message.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.520]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much for your continued grace, and we do want to
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.920]   pray for the mission team from BMC and for Jason and for Andrew, who are going to be
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.640]   headed out this Friday.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.040]   We pray, Father God, as He has requested, that the camp would go smoothly, that there
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.160]   would be no opportunity for Satan to divide them, a greater heart, Lord God, for the lost,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.080]   and specifically, Lord, for Jason, that he may be able to meet someone who is hungry,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.280]   Lord, to learn, to grow, that he may be able to follow up on even after he comes back.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.120]   I pray for each of the team members, for the leaders, Lord God, who are leading this team,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.920]   that you would watch over them, and that, again, it would be truly a time to bear fruit,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.320]   Father God, and that their fruit would encourage us, Lord, when they come back as well.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.360]   We pray this morning as we search your word, help us to understand, Lord, your heart for
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.540]   us.
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.680]   Help us not to simply study, Lord, the meaning of it, but your very heart and thought, Lord,
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.360]   that it would convict our thoughts and our heart, Lord God.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.440]   So we entrust this time to you in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.440]   Amen.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.440]   All right, let me start off this morning by asking you a simple question.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.680]   In the last week, is there something that you've been looking forward to?
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.960]   Maybe it could be coming down next year, maybe you have a child coming, or maybe you have
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.920]   a vacation coming, and maybe in a few weeks or months, or maybe you apply for a job and
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.360]   you're waiting for a reply, and whatever it may be, what is it that you've been longing
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.880]   for or waiting for?
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.900]   Now, all of us probably have something.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.200]   Maybe there isn't anything specific going on in your life, but there's something that
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.160]   we're looking forward to, whatever that may be.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.640]   And a lot of these things are not wrong, that's just human nature.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.440]   If something exciting is happening or something is changing, it's something that we end up
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.120]   looking forward to.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.280]   But along with that question, when was the last time that you really thought that you
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.200]   were longing for fellowship with Christ?
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.400]   When was the last time you were really longing and anticipating for Christ coming?
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.640]   Now these short-term goals that we have, or short-term things that we're looking for,
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.200]   again, these are all human nature.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.720]   If there's change coming or something that we're desiring, a better position and job,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.860]   or maybe a vacation you're going to take, there's nothing sinful about that.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.640]   But these are all short-sighted things, only short-term goals.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.320]   When was the last time you really longed for and looked for a deeper fellowship with Christ,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.000]   and which caused you to long for the coming of Christ?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.880]   The reason why this question is so important, if you can't remember the last time that there
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.680]   was a stirring and longing, not just a simple passing thought, "I should be this way, I
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.240]   should be that way," but a stirring in your heart that is so deep, and it caused you to
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:23.320]   long for, maybe even look up into heaven and think, "When is he going to come?"
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.280]   That question is so vital that we don't just dismiss that, that we don't just file that
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.520]   away.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.640]   Because scripture says in 1 John 2 and 3, "Beloved, we are God's children now, and what
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   we will be has not yet appeared, but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.060]   because we shall see him as he is.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.700]   And everyone who does hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure."
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.000]   Our sanctification is directly linked to this longing for Christ.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.320]   It is this longing for his second coming, his longing to connect with Christ, is what
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.640]   causes you to seek him in prayer.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.720]   If there isn't this longing in your heart, you can put in the time to pray, but it's
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.080]   always kind of like, "Did I do enough?
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.600]   Have I prayed enough and that's it?
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.320]   Have I served enough and that's it?"
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.920]   We're always looking to just kind of do what's needed to do.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.980]   Ultimately, our sanctification, our desire for holiness is directly linked to this hunger
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.280]   for Christ.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.680]   So if you can't remember the last time you had this longing and hungering, not just a
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.120]   passing thought of duty, like, "I should do this," but this longing for his second coming,
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.440]   that may be a revelation that you've been disconnected with Christ.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.740]   You've been at church.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.960]   You may have been putting in some prayer.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.840]   You may have had some fellowship, but it may be a sign that you've been disconnected, that
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.700]   you haven't been growing, that you haven't been maturing.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.680]   Sanctification hasn't been happening in your life because he says, "He who longs for these
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.600]   things purifies himself as he is pure."
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.240]   It is our longing for him, longing for who he is that causes us to be holy and to pray.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.440]   Now, why is this pertinent to the passage that we're looking at this morning?
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:24.920]   Paul has been explaining in the context genuine salvation because the Jews were so focused
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.520]   on the external things that they were doing and they were coming before God and said,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.160]   "Look how much time I'm spending in prayer.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   Look at what I'm doing.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.920]   Look how much I'm giving.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.160]   Look how much I'm serving at the temple."
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.040]   Remember what Jesus says to the Samaritan woman, that he doesn't care if you're worshiping
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.000]   in this mountain or that mountain.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.320]   He's looking for true worshipers who will worship him in spirit and in truth, real worship,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.960]   not just people who are checking off the box and say, "Well, I'm being discipled because
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.600]   I'm doing these five things."
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.880]   Is there this longing and hungering for God that's causing you to study the Bible?
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.300]   Or are you studying the Bible because that's what you're supposed to do?
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.280]   Is there a longing and hungering for God that's causing you to want to pray and seek God?
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.480]   Or is it just another check off box that you need to do because that's what a good Christian
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.120]   does?
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.680]   Paul has said, he says, "Moses writes," in verse 5, chapter 10, verse 5, "Moses writes
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.920]   about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandment
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920]   shall live by them."
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.600]   In other words, if you are going to base your righteousness upon what you do, you need to
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.720]   do this perfectly.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.320]   He says in the next passage, "Who's going to say?
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.320]   Who's going to go up to heaven and bring him down?
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.240]   Who's going to descend and bring him back up?"
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.720]   In other words, it is impossible.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.520]   Even by faith, if we were to be saved in any other way, he said, "You need to be absolutely
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.520]   perfect.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.360]   You would have to go up to heaven and bring him down.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.440]   You'd have to descend into the abyss and bring him up."
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.840]   In other words, it is absolutely impossible.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:11.040]   So the beginning of our salvation is recognition that we cannot.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.600]   This morning, we're going to go into the second part of what I started last week.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.440]   And then I'm going to just give you, again, three-point outline of this morning's sermon
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.600]   so that it'll be easier for you to follow.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.640]   First, saving faith.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.220]   Saving faith requires confession of lordship of Christ.
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.040]   We kind of started on that last week and I didn't get to finish that, so I'll finish
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.680]   that this morning.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.800]   Saving faith requires confession of lordship of Christ.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.360]   Second point, saving faith requires belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.840]   Oh, sorry.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.920]   B, saving faith requires inner transformation that leads to outer confession.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.640]   Saving faith requires inner transformation that leads to outer confession.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:57.040]   Thirdly, saving faith requires belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:04.440]   Last week, we talked about how it says, "He who confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord, believes
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.560]   in his heart that he was raised from the dead, he shall be saved."
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.200]   And we talked about last week about how in the oral tradition that what they said and
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:20.280]   what they confessed was equivalent to today of maybe signing a contract or even a marriage
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.280]   ceremony.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:28.760]   So oftentimes, people took that oral, this confession as kind of like public baptism.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.120]   Where somebody stood and publicly professed their loyalty to Christ was no different than
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.880]   today if they were to come into a marriage contract and filed it into the court of law,
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.000]   it was binding.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.360]   So confession wasn't simply words being spoken.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:54.200]   It was a public declaration of radical change that took place.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.080]   And what was this confession?
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:03.720]   This confession was to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.800]   Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.200]   Now again, you and I live in a culture where we call him Lord without really giving much
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.480]   thought about what that means.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.400]   We sing songs about how he is Lord, we establish you and we worship you, we say all of these
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.960]   things, we confess all of these things without really giving it serious thought.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.960]   Is that true?
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.840]   Are the things that I am saying, do I really believe this?
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.560]   Am I studying the word of God and listening and reading these things, do I really confess
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.720]   to believe this?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.960]   And you know, the sad thing is when we live in our Christian bubble and we're not being
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.160]   challenged, we never really have to even think about it.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.960]   You know, that's why it's very uncomfortable.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.120]   If you're, you know, while you're in college, you're surrounded by other Christians and
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.320]   we're all we're doing is affirming each other's faith.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.080]   It's like, yes, you know, don't worry about it.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   Don't be discouraged.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   The Lord loves you.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.200]   He makes all things work out for good.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.120]   And we have these cliche things that we say to each other and all of a sudden we graduate
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:10.320]   and we go to our workplace and somebody asks, you believe that?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.080]   How could you believe that?
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.400]   You mean Jesus Christ is the only way that you really believe that he died and was resurrected?
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.200]   And then once we get challenged, we feel uncomfortable because we never really had to answer these
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.500]   questions before.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.620]   And so our knee jerk reaction is, oh, those people are, you know, they're not, they're
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.680]   hostile to the gospel.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.040]   So we end up kind of staying away from those people who make us uncomfortable.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:39.080]   But if we're regularly engaged with non-Christians, these are things that they will constantly
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.040]   ask you, do you really believe that?
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.360]   And they're going to make you defend it.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.440]   But as long as we're in our Christian bubble with Christian friends and Christian family,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.280]   Christian church, you don't really need to answer this question because there's a constant
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.280]   affirmation.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.340]   You are, of course you have genuine faith.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.760]   Of course you have this.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.840]   I didn't, it is absolutely crucial we're able to answer this question with an amen, not
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   just I think so, because our whole salvation hinges upon the genuineness of our faith.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.460]   Our whole hope in Christ hinges upon how genuine this faith is.
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:25.460]   So if we just assume faith and we're constantly encouraged not to think any deeper than, of
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:32.840]   course you do, then what if we never really asked the question and we die and then standing
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.500]   before God, we realize that this confession wasn't real.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   It is absolutely essential.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.420]   And that's why it says, "He who confesses with his mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord."
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.940]   We talked about that and again, I didn't get to finish it last week, but you know, in the
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:12:00.900]   scripture, the very definition, the very definition of sin is to not to have Christ as Lord.
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.100]   There's a lot of different words that have been translated.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.180]   There's transgression, disobedience, there's error, blemish, lawlessness, but the most
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:15.660]   common word that is translated in the English Bible where we see the word sin is hamartion.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.020]   And the word hamartion simply means to miss the mark.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:25.880]   Now that doesn't sound too serious in comparison to transgression or disobedience or wickedness
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.340]   or lawlessness.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:34.060]   That sounds more like a sin that deserves punishment, but to miss the mark, it almost
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:39.420]   kind of sounded like you shot for an A and you got a B. You missed the mark.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.100]   That you wanted to do something and you just kind of didn't make it or you shot an arrow
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.980]   and you didn't hit the center, you kind of hit the side, you missed the mark.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:55.060]   So on the surface, it seems like hamartion, the word sin, doesn't seem deserving of this
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.700]   judgment that we see in scripture.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:04.540]   And we talked about that last week, how that word perfectly describes how the reign of
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.820]   death came into mankind.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:12.220]   All they did was eat fruit that was forbidden from God.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.780]   God said, "Do not eat of this fruit or you shall surely die."
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.140]   What was so wrong about eating this fruit that sin would penetrate into mankind and
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.500]   sin and death would reign?
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.980]   What was so bad about this fruit?
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.420]   It was in eating this fruit.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.660]   They were rebelling against the Lordship of Christ.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.060]   They decided that they're going to determine what is good, that they're going to determine
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.060]   what is bad.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:46.300]   So in the very essence of the word hamartion, there is this idea of self-governing.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.800]   I'm going to determine what is right.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.700]   So this word hamartion isn't simply that you shot for an A and you got a B. The word hamartion
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.140]   basically means I'm going to make my own target.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.500]   I'm going to determine what is right and what is wrong.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.820]   I'm going to determine what I'm going to do with my life.
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:11.920]   So the essence of human rebellion is to reject God's Lordship and to put me in that place.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.300]   You know what that means?
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:22.500]   That means you can be the most moral person in this room and not be saved if you miss
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.800]   the mark.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:32.260]   That means you can be the best father and mother that you can possibly be and still
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.740]   miss the mark.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.960]   You can be the best student.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.680]   You can have the most integrity in your work and people may say, "Wow, that person is really
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.560]   morally upright.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.740]   They're really generous.
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.940]   They're giving and caring and kind."
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.580]   And you can have all of that and still miss the mark.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.980]   And we determine for ourselves what is right and what is wrong, what I pursue, what I'm
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.700]   going to do with my life.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.680]   And that's why Jesus says, "He who finds his life shall lose it."
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.300]   In the context of finding life, a lot of times you're not trying to be a murderer or a cheater.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.020]   You're just trying to be a good person.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.260]   You're trying to take care of your family, pay the bills.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.480]   In and of itself, it doesn't seem like rebellion.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.280]   In and of itself, it seems like that's what every good person should do.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.000]   But that's exactly what Paul was saying.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.880]   All the good that you've been pursuing, you've been trying so hard to take care of your family,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.400]   you've been trying so hard to be a good Jew and to be faithful, serve the temple, even
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:41.480]   giving to the poor, and yet they completely miss the mark.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.240]   He says, "That's why he says, 'He who confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord.'"
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:54.840]   See, in Revelation 7, 15-17, whenever we think of lordship, we automatically think of somebody
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.280]   else outside of us oppressing us.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.940]   Those of you, obviously, all of you guys, most of you guys are not teenagers anymore,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:07.900]   but some of you guys don't remember, it wasn't too far ago, that long ago, that you remember
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.800]   what it was like to have your parents tell you what to do.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.560]   And now you're a college student or beyond college student or married and have kids,
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.320]   and you can determine for yourself.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.020]   I make my own money, I do my own thing, so I don't have anybody governing me.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:29.400]   So the idea of lordship, it kind of feels like it's taken us back to when we were young
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.480]   and having our parents telling us what to do, when to go to sleep, when to come home.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.100]   I don't need a curfew, I don't need somebody breathing down my neck telling me if I've
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.080]   spent too much money.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.280]   So when we think about lordship, a lot of people have this knee-jerk reaction, it's
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.320]   like, "Oh man, lordship.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.040]   I have to, he's going to tell me what to do."
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.680]   And so we wrestle with this idea of surrendering the freedom that we've gained from maturing,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.060]   from just getting older.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.440]   But in Revelation 7, 15-17, there's a passage that we studied in Revelation this week, it
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.600]   says, "Therefore they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night."
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.920]   And he's talking about all of us.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:17.080]   At the end times when we get to heaven, we're going to be serving him day and night.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:23.160]   So if you wrestle with lordship, the idea of lordship just kind of feels oppressive,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.040]   that automatically kind of like, "Man, these are things that I want to do and God's going
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.560]   to give me a guilt trip."
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.160]   So if you get to heaven, he said, "You're going to be serving him day and night."
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.980]   You're not even going to be wrestling with it because God, you know, maybe he won't catch
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.760]   certain things when you're up in heaven, he's up close, he's going to see everything.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:49.200]   So if the idea, or at least your false concept of lordship feels oppressive, then man, you're
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.320]   headed for deep oppression when you get to heaven because when we get there, he said,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.160]   "We're going to be serving him day and night."
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.280]   But I want you to continue to read what it says.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.200]   He says, "We serve him day and night in his temple and he who sits on the throne will
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.240]   shelter them with his presence."
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.120]   They will serve him and in that service, when we are in his service, he says, "We are going
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.360]   to be sheltered," meaning that God is going to protect us.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.240]   He's going to provide for us.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.240]   Just like any good father or mother will do for their children, he says, "I want you to
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.080]   obey because my ultimate purpose is to take care of you.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.760]   They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, the sun shall not strike them, nor
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.520]   any scorching heat, for the lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd and he
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.960]   will guide them to springs of living water and God will wipe away their tears from their
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.060]   eyes."
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:51.160]   You notice how lordship of Christ is directly linked to his shepherding presence?
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:57.520]   The lordship of Christ is directly linked to his presence.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:07.920]   So when we talk about lordship, it's God commanding us, demanding of us to stay within his care.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.480]   That he spreads his wing among us and says, "This is where I am."
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   So lordship is him telling us to come under his wings.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.360]   So to rebel against that lordship basically is saying, "I don't want to be under your
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.520]   care.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.600]   I don't want to be near your presence.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.360]   I want to keep my distance so I can adore you from a distance."
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.640]   So there are so many Christians who live off of other people's testimony.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.040]   And we hear about other people who are going to far off countries and they come back and
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.240]   they're excited for their faith or people who've sacrificed and prayed and how God answered
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.240]   their prayer and they have all these testimonies.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:52.320]   But so many Christians, in fear of, "If I get too close, he's going to demand things
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.640]   that I don't want to give up."
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:59.360]   So their testimony is always just observing other people from a distance.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.600]   So we love to read books, blogs.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.400]   We love hearing testimonies because it makes us feel like we're close to God without being
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.320]   close to God.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.680]   We love to hear like stories of answered prayers of what God is doing around the world because
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.720]   it makes us feel like we're near Christ without being near to Christ.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   I think the best way for me to explain Lordship is, I know some of you guys have visited certain
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:34.520]   parts of the world that you wish that you could take your maybe future spouse, you know,
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.920]   or somebody that you really care about or a really good friend.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.880]   And you come back and you show them pictures, you put it on Facebook and say, "It was awesome."
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.080]   You know, I've been to a couple places like that.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.320]   At one place, I really, I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to, but I've seen pictures
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.280]   of it, Machu Picchu.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.440]   Some of you guys have been there.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.120]   I don't know, like all the pictures I see online, that's one place I was like, "Wow,
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.280]   I want to go see that in person."
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.160]   I know some of you guys have probably visited that place.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.880]   I visited a couple places in China, and I'm not talking about Beijing.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.520]   I went on this Silk Road tour when I was there the first time, and it took me down to areas
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.560]   of China where it wasn't developed.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.560]   There's no big buildings.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.920]   It's way in the countryside, two, three-hour drive.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.880]   And basically, we followed the Great Wall, or like the whole Great Wall, and there are
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.480]   some places where it just kind of, you can see it just kind of dwindle out and where
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.800]   they stopped building it.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.720]   And you go to some of those places, I mean, it's just completely, no human hands have
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.240]   touched it in a long, long time.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.000]   And I remember the mountains that I saw, it was like nothing I've ever seen.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.360]   So I came back, and I said, "Esther, you know, one of these days, I want you to come with
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.720]   me because I want you to see this scenery."
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.920]   We haven't been able to do that.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   We've been to China, but usually it was for summer missions, so we didn't have opportunity
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.020]   to tour.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:01.280]   But when you go to some place like that, you immediately have this thought of, "I wish
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.720]   I could show you what I saw."
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:12.760]   See, the Lordship of Christ is God trying to bring us into His life, into His protection.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.980]   But the only way to really show you is if you have to leave where you are and come with
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.880]   me.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.160]   The only way that I can really show you what I saw is to let go of whatever it is that
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.680]   you're afraid of letting go and come with me so I can show it to you.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.280]   Ultimately, that's what Lordship is, where God is saying that you've been satisfied for
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.400]   too long with trivial things.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   You've been satisfied and content with trivial things that ultimately doesn't satisfy, and
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.520]   you know it.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:51.040]   You know that the things that you've been pursuing, it's one disappointment after another.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.760]   And Jesus comes to us, He says, "Well, I've delivered you from an empty way of life.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.960]   Now come follow me because I want to give you life.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:08.120]   The life that you've been pursuing, it just keeps leading to an empty road or dead end."
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:15.700]   See, if we don't recognize Lordship as Him inviting us away from an empty way of life
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:22.780]   so that He can give us this new life, it will always feel like a burden.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:31.820]   And if it's a burden in your heart, then preaching of Lordship is just going to feel heavy.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:38.140]   Life is hard enough as it is, and then He wants me to do more or do less.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.900]   You know, these trivial things give me energy to make it another week, and you want me to
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.900]   give that up?
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:54.340]   See, at the core, at the essence of salvation is to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:24:00.000]   Is to acknowledge that we've been living in sin before we met Christ.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.500]   The essence of salvation is to recognize that what I've been pursuing, that I've been at
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.580]   the center of my life, that I've been making my own decisions of what I'm going to pursue,
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.140]   what is right and what is wrong.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:18.500]   The essence of salvation is to recognize that, to repent of that, and make Christ my Lord.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.840]   Make His Word my Lord.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.100]   What He values, my Lord.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.860]   If you do not have that, that is not salvation.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:34.460]   That's what James calls demonic salvation, where you acknowledge all the theology without
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.500]   embracing Him as Lord.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.340]   Having a form of godliness, have no power.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.500]   You can talk about testimonies because it's always about other people, but it's never
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.600]   yours.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.880]   You could share stories about what I've seen and say, "Oh, you know, Peter has seen this
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.620]   and this, and that's what he tells me."
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:58.940]   You can regurgitate that information to somebody else, but what does it mean to be a witness?
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:04.700]   Evangelizing isn't getting a set of facts and then transferring that fact to other people.
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.580]   Evangelism is what you have seen, what you have witnessed, you take it to somebody else
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.620]   and come with me so that I can show Him to you too.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.980]   So if you are not seeing Him, if you're not connecting to Him, if you're not hearing from
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:22.460]   Him, how can you possibly be a witness?
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:28.140]   See this Lordship of Christ is at the center of what it means to be saved.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.260]   You become a Christian and then here's some other Lordship thing that you have to worry
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.260]   about.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.260]   No.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.940]   At the very core of salvation is to make Him our Lord.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:46.060]   At the very core of our salvation is to abandon our old life and to embrace a new in Christ.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:52.220]   Secondly, saving faith requires inner transformation that leads to outer confession.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.740]   If Lordship is, "Oh, you know what?
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:00.500]   That's what I should be doing," and there is no internal transformation, then yeah,
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:06.720]   everything that you hear this morning is just going to end up making you feel guilty.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:15.380]   If all you're hearing is, "I got to do more," then you're going to leave this room heavily
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.380]   burdened.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:23.920]   How many of you who've been out of college for more than five to 10 years, has it been
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   a cakewalk?
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.940]   Some of you guys had difficult time finding jobs.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.000]   Some of you guys found jobs that you thought was so great and then you found out your boss
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.800]   was no good, or maybe your coworkers are slandering you, or someone else is getting the promotion
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.440]   while you are not.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.700]   You see your friends advancing and you don't see yourself, or maybe you feel stuck and
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.700]   life is hard enough as it is.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.620]   Then you come to church and then I got to do more and the very little thing that I have
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.380]   that gives me strength to continue, like I can't do that anymore and I'm going to feel
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.980]   guilty doing that.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:06.340]   If there isn't an inner transformation that leads to this confession of Christ as Lord,
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.140]   yeah, then it will lead to greater burden.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.500]   But that's not what he's talking about.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.920]   That's why he says in two separate ways in verse 9, "Because if you confess with your
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.580]   mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.580]   will be saved."
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.380]   He basically says the same thing in reverse order in verse 10, "For with the heart one
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:33.740]   believes and is justified and with the mouth one confesses and is saved."
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:39.740]   Our confession, at least in the order that we see in scripture, if it isn't coming from
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:46.620]   what is within, and say, "Well, Jesus is Lord," but that's not how you really feel.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.420]   That's not what's happening within you, inside.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.780]   It can become a tremendous burden.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:59.740]   In Matthew 12, 35, "The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.620]   evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil."
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:08.020]   In other words, if this confession of Lordship isn't coming out of a transformation that's
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.980]   taking place in your heart, it will lead to bitterness.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.980]   I guarantee it.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:22.020]   Let me give you a perfect example.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.340]   I have teenage children in my house, and I have a little one.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.940]   He's not at that point yet.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.580]   My little one, who's nine, he's kind of like our pet.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:38.780]   He still loves to go everywhere we go, and so everything is more fun when he's around.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:45.220]   But the teenagers in our home, wherever we go, if their friend's not there, it's not
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.220]   exciting.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.660]   We've gotten to a point where we don't expect them to come with us.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:57.260]   Anybody who's raised kids or anybody who's been a schoolteacher, you know how excruciatingly
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.180]   difficult it is when you have a group of people that you're going, "They just don't want to
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.760]   be there."
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.820]   They came because they had to come.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.780]   I stopped asking them to come to weddings, unless they wanted to come.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.860]   They say, "Oh, yes."
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.580]   I stopped asking them, "Hey, we're going to do this," unless it's a family gathering where
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.820]   they have to come.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.140]   Because when they come, they ruin everything.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.980]   Because you know they don't want to be there.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.100]   The moment you get there, they're like, "How long are we going to be here?
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.100]   How long are we going to be here?"
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.500]   Every five minutes, "How long are we going to be here?"
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.500]   They say, "Oh, yes, the reception."
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.500]   It's like, "Wait, when's it starting?
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.500]   When's it starting?
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.580]   Are we going to stay for the whole thing?
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.580]   The whole thing?
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.860]   We're going to stay for the whole thing?"
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.060]   It just ruins everything.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.060]   They don't like it.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.060]   I don't like it.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.100]   So I stopped asking.
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.460]   Because they're doing something they don't want to do.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.540]   But they have to do it because their parents are making them do it.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.380]   So at some point, as soon as they're old enough, we stopped asking.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:08.940]   "I only want you to come if you want to come, because I don't want to torture you, and I
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.180]   don't want you to torture me."
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:19.540]   Religiousness, that's exactly how it feels.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:24.980]   When you've got a church filled with people who are obligated to come to church, but they
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:31.340]   don't want to be there, it is excruciatingly painful.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.420]   You're doing Bible study with people who are really not that interested in what the Bible
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:41.740]   has to say, but they will keep coming because they have to come.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.300]   If they want to be a member of this church, if they want to be participants of this community,
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.420]   I have to come.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.540]   But they're not interested in the Bible study.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.060]   But we're going to have Bible study anyway because you're here.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.220]   Oh my gosh, it's draining.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.600]   Try to have prayer meeting with somebody who doesn't want to be there.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:07.220]   But they have to be because they're supposed to be.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.940]   What he's saying is like, "Oh, here's some things that you need to do," and jump over
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.940]   the hoops and just come.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.620]   I don't care if you want to come or not.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:18.060]   The real confession comes from an inner transformation that takes place in our hearts.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.700]   In 2 Corinthians 4, 6, it says, "For God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,'
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.900]   has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.900]   face of Jesus Christ."
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.500]   Our salvation happened first internally.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.820]   He shed his light where?
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.820]   In our hearts.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.220]   There was a transformation that took place that caused us the desire to want to know
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.380]   him.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:50.660]   So our worship is a privilege when there's a transformation that's taking place in our
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.660]   hearts.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.540]   But when there's no transformation in our hearts, it's like taking teenagers to a wedding
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.340]   that doesn't want to be there.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.140]   They'll put in their time, right?
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.620]   So in their minds, they go, "Well, that wedding's 45 minutes and reception an hour.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.140]   I'll put up with that."
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:14.660]   Anything more than that, anything more than that, you'll hear grumbling and complaining,
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.660]   right?
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.060]   It's no different.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.740]   You have a church filled with people who are not really attracted to Christ.
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.300]   You are longer than you're supposed to be.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.580]   It's not exactly where you want.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.180]   Any little thing is cause of grumbling.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:37.060]   Food, position of chairs, the temperature of the room, certain people, where they sit,
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   where they don't sit.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.060]   Why it's this?
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.260]   I mean, it's just any little thing.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.940]   But that's not what Christ calls us for.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.980]   Hebrews chapter 8, 10, it says, "For this is the covenant that I will make with the
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.260]   house of Israel.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.820]   After those days, declares the Lord, I will put my laws into their minds and write them
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.820]   on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.380]   Where is he going to write them?
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:06.940]   On their hearts, meaning salvation happens in our hearts first.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:11.300]   There is a longing and a stirring that takes place within our hearts when true faith, saving
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.620]   faith happens.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:19.740]   And it causes us to see Christ as our treasure and not this world.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.260]   And when we see Christ as our treasure, we get to come and worship him.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.460]   We get to pray and connect with him.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.380]   We get to declare him to other people.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:34.340]   But when he is not our treasure, and he says, "Pick up your cross," like, "Oh my gosh,
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.580]   the cross."
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.580]   We don't see what's on the other side of the cross.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.660]   We don't see what the cross produces.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:44.020]   We only see the heavy burden of the cross.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:51.820]   See, it says in 1 Corinthians 12, 3, "No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except in the Holy
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.020]   Spirit."
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:34:00.460]   Unless the Holy Spirit is in you, stirring you, drawing you to him, you cannot confess,
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:05.920]   at least in the way that the scripture declares it, that Jesus is Lord.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.180]   You can say it.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:14.180]   Anybody can say it, but what he means by confess, to make this covenant, willingly,
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:19.180]   joyfully, to publicly declare that he is my Lord.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:24.380]   Not only is that the case, in 1 Corinthians 2, 14 and 15, you can't even understand the
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.180]   things of God unless there has been a transformation taking place in our hearts.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.460]   The natural person does not accept the things that are of the Spirit of God, for they are
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.100]   folly to him.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:38.900]   See, this idea of placing him as Lord in our lives is foolishness to those who have not
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.780]   been changed.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.420]   And he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:50.900]   So unless there is a spiritual transformation in our hearts, every Bible study, every prayer
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.620]   meeting, every gathering, every worship is just clocking in and clocking out.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.580]   It is nothing more than superstition.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:04.180]   It is nothing more than superstition because you have been raised to think that if you
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.540]   go to church, God will bless you.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.660]   If you don't go to church, God won't bless you.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.840]   So you feel a sense of uneasiness when you are not at church.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:20.300]   So you go, like a teenager, to a wedding he doesn't want to be at.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:26.580]   You go to prayer meetings, like a teenager going to a wedding that doesn't want to be
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.880]   there.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:34.780]   You go to Bible studies, like a teenager who doesn't want to go to a wedding but has to
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.940]   be there.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:43.780]   And it's not producing in you life, it's producing in you death.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.980]   Doesn't it?
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.140]   Religiousness produces death.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.140]   You feel suffocated in religion.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:36:05.020]   It doesn't produce joy, but when real worship takes place, there's life.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:12.900]   When you search the Word of God and you hear His breath from His Word, there's no Netflix
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:23.880]   movie, there's no blockbuster movie that can compare to being in the presence of His Spirit.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.060]   Lordship is not something that you have to do and you calculate, I shouldn't do this,
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.660]   I shouldn't do this.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:37.340]   Lordship happens, not because you're a good person, but because we're selfish.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.960]   You understand what I mean?
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.420]   Lordship happens because we're selfish, because we want to be happy.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:48.500]   Lordship happens because we want to feel alive.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:53.300]   It's not because we're benevolent, not because we're sacrificial.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:37:01.320]   Lordship happens because we're selfish, because we want what we want and we want Christ.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:06.460]   So lordship happens when there is inner transformation.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.660]   That's why He says, "He who confesses with the mouth of Jesus his Lord and believes in
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:14.820]   his heart that he was raised from the dead, he shall be saved."
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.860]   Third and finally, and I won't spend too much time on this, saving faith requires belief
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.500]   in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:25.460]   Now why is this particular doctrine singled out?
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:30.260]   There's His death, His incarnation, there's all kinds of things, like glorification, but
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.540]   why just His resurrection?
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.220]   One, this is not comprehensive.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.980]   Obviously you also need to believe in His death, His deity, His incarnation, you need
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.920]   to believe in all of that.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.620]   This is being singled out because it really is at the core.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.340]   There's three things that I want to quickly mention before why He singles this out.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:57.260]   One, just to give you an example, in 1 John 4, John is dealing with Christian Gnostics
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.340]   who are denying Jesus' incarnation.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.040]   So he says, "By this you know the Spirit of God.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.240]   Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.300]   spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God."
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:14.380]   So he singles out His incarnation as genuine faith because that's what he was dealing with,
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.100]   with the Gnostics.
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:22.460]   Here he singles out resurrection because the resurrection was at the core.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.380]   It gave flesh to everything that Jesus said.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.460]   So there's three specific things that I'm going to mention.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:33.380]   One, resurrection of Jesus Christ distinguishes Him from every other prophet.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.200]   Many other people came and they kind of performed miracles, remember?
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.900]   Even when He was delivering Israel from Egypt, He performed these miracles and they tried
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.660]   to match everyone point by point.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:52.260]   In fact, if you look at the prophets of Jewish history, the greatest prophet or the prophet
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.380]   that performed the most miracle was not Jesus.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:02.300]   As much as Jesus did in His life, if you look at Elijah's life, he did some crazy stuff.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:08.220]   You look at Elisha, Elisha probably performed more miracles, more spectacular miracles than
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.700]   that may be recorded of Jesus.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.540]   Maybe he did more, but at least that's recorded.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.140]   What distinguished Jesus from any other prophet, because many people believe Jesus, maybe He
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.780]   might be that prophet.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.300]   He might be the greatest prophet possibly, but what distinguished Him from any other
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.780]   prophet, any other human being was His resurrection.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:33.140]   Secondly, the resurrection proved that Jesus had the power to forgive sins.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:39.580]   That His proof that He was beyond the prophet, that He really was the Son of God as He proclaimed,
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:45.580]   that He was equal with God, that only He had the power to give life and take it out.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.780]   He said He has the power to forgive sins.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:54.260]   His resurrection, His resurrection proved with power that He had the power to forgive
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.820]   sins.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.740]   Jesus Himself said, "I lay down my life.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.180]   No one takes it away from me."
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.460]   But along with that, He says, "There's no greater love than this, than a friend lay
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.120]   down his life for his friend."
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:12.380]   So His resurrection was a proof that He was beyond other prophets, that He said who He
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:18.740]   said He was, and ultimately that it proved His love when He resurrected.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:24.660]   But third and finally, resurrection is the ultimate goal of salvation.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.660]   Remember we talked about that last week?
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:34.700]   You have, when we talk about salvation, you have, we're saved from something, and what's
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.660]   the other part of it, saved for something.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.380]   See His death at the cross saved us from our sins.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.900]   His resurrection from the dead saved us for this new life.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.940]   That's exactly how salvation is described in Romans 6, 3-4.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:54.380]   Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.940]   His death?
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.860]   We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.900]   raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in the newness of life.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.420]   You notice what He says here?
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:11.860]   You were buried with Him in death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.380]   in the glory of the Father, that you too may live a newness of life.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:22.880]   So we were saved from our sins in order that we may live unto God.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:31.120]   So the resurrection in the confession of itself is to establish His Lordship over our life,
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.480]   meaning that our old way of life is being put away.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   First Corinthians 15-20, "But if in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruit
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.860]   of those who have fallen asleep, for as by a man came death, by man has come also the
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.840]   resurrection of the dead.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.940]   For as Adam all died, so also Christ shall all be made alive.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.700]   But each in his own order, Christ the first fruit, and at His coming those who belong
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.700]   to Christ."
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:02.100]   Our whole point of salvation is not to prevent eternal damnation.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:08.480]   He prevented eternal damnation in order that we may have this newness of life.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.280]   Whole point of Christianity is the resurrected life.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:20.340]   The whole point of His death, and that's why His resurrection is called the first fruit,
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.100]   is the first of many to come.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.900]   And you and I are the many.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:32.580]   The whole point of our repentance is to live the new life, new life.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:38.660]   So let me ask you with this, and as I started with the same question, when was the last
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:48.300]   time that you can remember where there was this stirring for Christ that led you to pray?
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.780]   When was the last time you came to Scripture because you recognized this new life and you
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.900]   desired it, you hungered and thirst for it?
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.980]   And that's what caused you to search through Scripture.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:07.780]   When was the last time that you hungered and thirst for this new life, and that's why you
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:14.700]   wanted to connect and fellowship with other Christians, to talk about what you loved,
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:20.380]   not simply because you felt lonely or you needed friends?
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:32.940]   If you can't remember the last time where there was a stirring, you're in big trouble.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:37.160]   Because that's the essence of Christianity.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.580]   That is the backbone of Christianity.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.060]   That's the foundation of Christianity.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:53.540]   So if that is not there, whatever it is we're pursuing, in light of that, if you really
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:59.340]   believe it, could it be that important?
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.300]   Could your school be that important?
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.580]   Could your job be that important?
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.700]   Could your relationship with your family and friends, could it be that important?
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:24.740]   Even your kids, is it even that important if the core of salvation, you don't have assurance?
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:29.300]   Has it become an obligation?
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.700]   Has it become your life?
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.940]   It is impossible to please God without faith.
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:44.180]   He who comes to God must first believe that He is, and He is a rewarder of those who genuinely
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.940]   seek Him.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:52.420]   I pray that we would be those people who genuinely seek Him, who believe with all our heart that
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.420]   He is.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.580]   And that's why we come.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:56.700]   That's why we pray.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.180]   That's why we study the Bible.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:07.300]   Let's take some time to pray as, again, we ask our worship team to come.
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:22.860]   Again, just take a few minutes to come before the Lord in genuine confession, genuine desire.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:27.060]   Because it is so easy to fall into this routine.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:31.220]   You don't have to make a decision to dry up your heart.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:36.820]   It happens when we're not being deliberate, when we focus our eyes upon the problems in
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.620]   our lives instead of fixing it upon Christ.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.860]   So let's take this opportunity to come before the Lord.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:50.900]   I've been focusing so much attention on the externals and maybe not enough on where I
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.100]   am in my heart.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.860]   So let's take some time to come before the Lord in prayer as our worship team leads us.
