[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.960]   If you can turn your Bibles to Matthew chapter 22, okay?
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.040]   I promise today is the last day I'm on this text and then I'll be jumping to the book
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.920]   of Hebrews, okay?
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.920]   Matthew chapter 22, verse 36 through 40.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.240]   "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.880]   And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.640]   soul, with all your mind."
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.880]   This is the great and foremost commandment and the second is like it.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.960]   You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.080]   And on these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.120]   Let's pray.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.640]   Gracious and loving Father, we pray for your Holy Spirit to convict us, let your word go
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.360]   forth and mold our hearts, our lives, our thinking, and even the things, Lord God, that
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.800]   bring us pleasure.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.880]   May it be renewed and washed according to your word.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.200]   So we ask, Lord God, that this sacred time is honored before you, that we would genuinely
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.880]   worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.400]   May God's word and its power that you have ordained fulfill its purpose this morning.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.080]   How many of you sometime this week saw the video that kind of went viral about this lady
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.280]   who was on an airplane and she kind of reclined and the person behind her got irritated and
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.320]   she was like banging on her chair.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.320]   She was reclining her chair.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.320]   How many of you guys saw that video?
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   Okay.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.200]   Well, you guys aren't hip, you guys aren't social media.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   Okay.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   Anyway, so that video went viral and then there was kind of a big discussion that took
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   place.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.600]   Was it her fault or his fault?
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.840]   Was she in the right by reclining her chair?
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.800]   And then the guy who was sitting behind her happened to be in the last seat in the airplane.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.880]   Some of you guys may have experienced that.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.040]   And because she reclined and he can't recline, obviously, you know, he's a bit cramped.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.320]   And I guess he asked her to put it back up and she did it while he was eating, but then
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.800]   she put it right back and then she wouldn't return.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.520]   And then so he got mad and he started banging on her chair throughout the whole flight.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.480]   And so the internet was divided in half where half the people were siding with him.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.240]   He said, "That's rude of her.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.320]   Knowing that he can't recline, he's uncomfortable.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.680]   He should have never done that."
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.360]   And then the other half were basically saying, "She has every right.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.600]   You're on the airplane.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.040]   How many times when we're on airplane long flights do we recline?
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.240]   We have a right to do that because it's uncomfortable."
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.360]   Now, wherever you land on that issue, right?
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.440]   The question that I have is how do you deal with people that irritate you, right?
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.960]   They get in your space, do things that annoy you.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.120]   That may be in your own home.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000]   It may be at work.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.160]   It may be a neighbor that you live next to, right?
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.920]   It may be a friend or certain acquaintances in your life.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.480]   Like they're annoying and it's very irritating to be around those people.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.920]   And as a result, we have a tendency to kind of stiff arm those people.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.840]   We have a tendency to be very strict with our acquaintances, but we don't really spend
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   a lot of time with them.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.480]   Now, we talked about last week about this agape love.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.680]   At the core of this teaching of agape love is loving people that are difficult to love.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.840]   And then he goes even further and say, "What good is it if you loan money to people who
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   can pay you back?
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.640]   Everybody else does that."
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.200]   And then he goes even further in saying that he loved us while we were ungrateful and even
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   sinners.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.440]   So that word agape love is deliberately targeting and loving people that you wouldn't naturally
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.280]   love in your own flesh.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.440]   It's difficult for us to be even around, even to be around people who annoy us, let alone
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.240]   make a conscious decision to love people who are slandering us, who've wronged us, who's
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.640]   out to get us, or we may think that they are.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.960]   So this idea of agape love is a beautiful message.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.120]   At the core of the gospel of Jesus Christ, that's why we sing about it.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.480]   We memorize scriptures.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.640]   We encourage each other with it.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.360]   But to actually practice this agape love is something beyond what you and I are able to
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.360]   do.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.080]   That's why, you know, it'd be great if we just talked about love of God and what He
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.720]   has done.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.000]   But the problem with that is the Bible always starts with indicative.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.760]   It always tells us about what happened and what He has done, but it almost always moves
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.280]   to "therefore."
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.080]   If you believe the agape love of God, therefore we ought to practice this agape love with
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.680]   one another.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.960]   If you've been studying the book of Ephesians with us, the first three chapters are primarily
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.220]   indicatives.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.380]   It teaches us about adoption, about propitiation, atonement.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.360]   It teaches us about His predestined love for us, in that even before the creation of the
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.360]   world, our God determined to love us.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.680]   So that's three chapters.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.800]   So we're, what, in the middle of chapter two, and we have about a chapter and a half
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.560]   left before we get to chapter four, but chapter four is coming.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.640]   Chapter four is coming because after that, Paul prays that the eyes of our heart may
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.680]   be enlightened so that we may have a deeper sense and understanding of this love.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.360]   And then if you do grasp that and you understand that and you believe that, chapter four, verse
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.280]   one, "Therefore I, prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.000]   with which you have been called."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.680]   There's a "therefore."
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.440]   If you love God or if God loves you, therefore.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.680]   So he says, "Walk worthy of the manner of which you've received that love."
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.520]   Then in verse two, he describes what that love looks like.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.440]   Verse two, "In humility, in gentleness, in showing tolerance, in love."
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.480]   So the primary practice of the gospel that we proclaim to believe is to practice the
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.120]   same love with one another.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.680]   We spent about three and a half years talking about the detailed teaching of the gospel
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   in the book of Romans.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.520]   Eleven chapters of exposition about what God has done and what he had accomplished, how
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.720]   he raised us up to be co-heirs with Christ.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.080]   And then at the conclusion of eleven chapters of exposition, he gets to chapter 12 and he
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.040]   says, "Therefore, considering all that you have learned, I urge you, brethren, by the
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.720]   mercy of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice."
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.360]   And then he describes what that living sacrifice looks like in verse nine, "Let love be without
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.080]   hypocrisy."
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.160]   So the primary application of receiving the love of God, therefore, is to practice this
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   love of God.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.760]   Like I said, today is the last day, okay?
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.800]   I made it through the first service, so I'm going to make it through the second service.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.080]   We're going to jump back to the book of Hebrews.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.520]   Hebrews, eleven chapters of Christology.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.400]   Who is Jesus?
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.800]   Why should we love him?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   Why should we follow him?
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.160]   Why should we worship him?
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.200]   That's eleven chapters of exposition.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.400]   So he concludes in chapter 11, here's these people who, because of their faith, they lived
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.640]   a certain way.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.200]   And then he concludes in chapter 12, "Therefore, considering all the indicatives that you have
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.000]   learned," here are the imperatives, "Therefore, since we have so great a crowd surrounding
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.880]   us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles, and
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.960]   let us run with endurance the race that is set before us."
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   So what is this race that we are to run?
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.200]   Verse 14, "Pursue peace with all men."
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:09.120]   To practice this love that we proclaim and believe that was practiced on us.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   Again, Colossians chapter 3, 1 through 2, after two chapters of Christology about the
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.520]   supremacy of Christ, he says, "Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.440]   seeking the things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God."
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.520]   And what does it mean to seek Christ above?
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.000]   Verse 12, "Put on a heart of compassion, kindness, and humility."
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.680]   So you cannot be a worshiper of God and just erase the "therefore"s that comes after it.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.080]   Because he says, "This is what God has done, and if you believe this, therefore, now practice
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.480]   this love with one another."
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.520]   Easy to preach.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.680]   I can literally open up any text in the New Testament and the Old Testament and preach
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.800]   about this agape love.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.680]   But to practice it, actually apply it.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.920]   So even this morning, if you hear this message and you start to think of it in your head,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.980]   in theory, in theory, it's great.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:18.560]   But if you try to apply it even a little bit this week, I'm pretty sure you face frustration
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.600]   with your own flesh.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.680]   Because you know how difficult that is to practice, even to just be around annoying
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.680]   people.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.080]   We don't want to be around annoying people.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:38.200]   To actually pursue somebody in this agape love who doesn't deserve it, there is nothing
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:45.760]   more sanctifying to a born-again Christian than the practice of this agape love.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.200]   Agape love is at the core of killing our pride.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.960]   A proud man will never approach somebody because he has to humble himself.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.200]   Agape love kills a self-centered life.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.720]   Because at the core, our natural reaction is to run away from danger.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:13.000]   So if somebody is causing harm, is slandering you, it is our natural reaction to run away
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.920]   from that person or even retaliate.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:23.600]   But the practice of agape love, it challenges and it kills a self-centered life.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.200]   Agape love, it kills a comfort and safety-driven life.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.240]   Where again, our natural desire is to run to safety, is to hide.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.880]   But agape love challenges us to go sometimes in places of danger for the purpose of someone
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.320]   else's good.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.000]   But this agape love is also the reason why you and I are here.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.480]   Not only does it kill our pride, a self-centered life, a life-seeking comfort and safety, it
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.320]   is the very reason why our sins are killed.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:05.520]   And why it is the agape love that kills the fear of death, that gives us the strength
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   to be able to live boldly.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:14.320]   Again, easy to talk about, but difficult to practice.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.920]   In fact, let me go a step further than that.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.960]   It is beyond difficult.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   It is impossible.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.640]   Impossible.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:30.040]   If you have somebody that you've been having a hard time forgiving, and they've been deliberately
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:40.240]   saying things to hurt you, I mean, not just to forgive them, but to actually love them.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.280]   It ruins your day, it ruins your appetite, it ruins fellowship.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.640]   It ruins even probably as you're listening to the sermon now.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.120]   Because there's a turmoil, there's a fight going on in your own heart, because you know
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.160]   how difficult this is.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:05.320]   But there is no truer evidence of a born-again Christian than when the Holy Spirit convicts
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.360]   us to practice this love.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.520]   Because only people who are the recipients of this agape love would even consider practicing
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.720]   this love.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.800]   It is the greatest evidence of a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.160]   That's what he says in John chapter 13.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.480]   By this, all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   as I have loved you.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.920]   So I want to finish this sermon, so I'm going to get to number two.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.440]   Number two.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.200]   This commandment is so practical.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.320]   Because not only is this commandment like loving God, you cannot love God and not love
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.200]   people, but two, it says we are to love our neighbors.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.720]   Now if you just read it, it's like, yeah, I mean, you probably memorized this first,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.400]   but why is this significant?
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:01.680]   Because he doesn't just say love the world.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.280]   Because it's easy to love the world.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.500]   Let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.560]   Because the world is abstract.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.760]   The world doesn't sit next to you.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.400]   When that person is punching your seat because they're irritating, we don't think of them
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   as the world.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.840]   When we think of the world, it's abstract.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.960]   So it's very easy to say God loves the world, I'm going to love the world.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   He doesn't say that.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.160]   He said love your neighbor.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   And who's our neighbor?
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.200]   I mean, technically, you can say somebody who lives next to us, but that's not what
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.000]   Jesus means by that.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.360]   He says in the Gospel of Luke, when a lawyer comes, he says, "Who's our neighbor?"
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.040]   And he describes an individual who basically was robbed and beaten.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.240]   So he's not talking about just somebody who lives next to us, he's talking about people
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.120]   that we encounter on a day-to-day basis.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:56.680]   In fact, the biblical understanding of neighbor is whoever's next to you is your neighbor.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.160]   People you're sitting next to.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.320]   I mean, that could be somebody who lives next to you.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.760]   It could be your husband, it could be your wife, it could be your own children.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.800]   The people who are the closest to us are our neighbors.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.880]   Here's a reason why he says to love our neighbors.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.120]   Because when we get convicted about these things, we can say, "You know what?
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.080]   I'm going to love the world as God loved the world."
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.400]   And it's abstract and it's hard to apply.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.160]   But he makes it very specific.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.840]   He says in 1 John 4.20, "If someone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.560]   a liar.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.600]   For the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   not seen."
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   So let me stop right there.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:46.360]   When I read that, at least the first time I read that, it's like, loving God is actually
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.160]   much easier than loving people.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.920]   Most people will admit, "I mean, God, what did he do?
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:59.820]   I mean, he loved us, he sacrificed his only begotten son, he suffered on my behalf.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.440]   How can I not love him?"
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.380]   He's actually much easier to love.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.440]   So many people say, "I love God, but I hate people."
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.360]   I mean, we can understand that.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.600]   People are much harder to love.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.960]   So what does he mean by here?
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.640]   If you can't love the people that you can see, how are you going to love a God that
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.640]   you cannot see?
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.520]   See, in theory, you can love God easier.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.300]   In theory.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.800]   The way you feel, it's easier to love God.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.240]   But that's not what he's talking about.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   He's talking about an agape love that is tangibly practiced.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.520]   And if you can't practice with the person sitting next to you, how are you going to
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.720]   practice that with somebody that you can't even see?
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.520]   Let me give you an example of how often this gets applied.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.200]   You know, whenever we get convicted about evangelism or world mission, you know, we
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.760]   get convicted about China.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   We get convicted about Japan.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.100]   We get convicted about India.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.160]   And so we prepare and get ready, and then we go way to the other part of the world to
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.400]   share the gospel and sacrificially love them.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.800]   You know, we're willing to eat food that we don't like in order to love these people.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   But then we don't practice the same thing here.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.200]   He said, "If you don't practice the love of Christ here, if you don't share the gospel
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.240]   with people who are here, who you can speak the same language, share the same culture
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.320]   from your own home, where you're with seven, eight, nine, ten hours a day, how are you
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.600]   going to love people way over there that you don't even speak the same language with?"
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:43.760]   In other words, his first calling for us to practice his love is with the people who are
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.520]   the closest to us, right next to us.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.360]   That's why they say the qualification of an elder is to make sure that he's a good husband,
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.160]   that he's a good father, because the proving ground, first and foremost, is with whoever
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.200]   he or she is the closest to.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.480]   It's easy to practice love from a distance, in theory, because all we have to do is say
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.320]   we love them how we feel toward them.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.480]   But that's not what he's talking about.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.080]   He says he calls us to love our neighbor.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.600]   In Matthew 25, 35-40, Jesus says, "For I was hungry, and ye gave me something to eat.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.560]   I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.880]   I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.280]   Naked, and you clothed me, and I was sick, and you visited me.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.240]   I was in prison, and you came to me."
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.200]   And the righteous will say, "When did we do that?"
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.720]   And Jesus says in verse 40, "He who has done it to the least of my children has done it
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.720]   unto me."
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:45.960]   In other words, the love of God was expressed to the people that was in need around us,
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.240]   immediately, tangibly.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.720]   But a lot of times, the way we practice love is in theory, how we feel.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.000]   But the Bible is very practical, right?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.200]   He didn't call us to love the world.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.040]   He said, "First and foremost," he says, "to love our neighbor."
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:13.520]   And our neighbor oftentimes is our very wives, is our husbands, is our own children, is our
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.760]   own parents, our brothers, our sister.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.360]   And then at church is the people who you're sitting next to.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.840]   He said, "If we don't practice the love with the people who are right next to us, how will
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.640]   we practice this love overseas?
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.000]   How will we practice this love with a God that we cannot see?"
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.720]   We are to love not in word, but in deed, in action.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:44.040]   That's why in Hebrews 10, 20-25, Apostle Paul, I think it's Apostle Paul, but whoever wrote
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:51.760]   this book, he says, "Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering."
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.080]   In other words, he's been telling us about who Jesus is and what he has done.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.400]   Hold fast basically doesn't… it doesn't just mean like, "Oh, just continue to feel
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.960]   a certain faith toward God."
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:09.560]   He's saying, "If you genuinely believe this, like hold fast means to make it yours.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:16.520]   Hold fast without wavering for he who promised is faithful and let us consider how to stimulate
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.000]   one another to love and good deeds."
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Stimulate one another.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.480]   So look at verse 24.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.920]   It's very practical.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.600]   "To loving our neighbors," he says, "to consider."
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.340]   Meaning that we don't wait passively to practice love.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.960]   We don't wait until somebody annoys us and says, "You know what?
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.160]   I'm going to love this person."
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.680]   Or somebody who's ungrateful in our lives.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.560]   He says, "No, let us consider.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.800]   Let us contemplate and plan to practice this.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.240]   Consider how to stimulate one another."
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.760]   You know the word for stimulate in Greek is a very strong word.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:00.280]   A more accurate translation of that word would be to provoke.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.080]   Typically when we use the word provoke in English, provoke typically has a negative
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   connotation.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.920]   Like somebody provoked you to grace.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.000]   We don't usually use it that way, right?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.800]   You get provoked to anger.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.440]   So it's a very strong reaction.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.080]   Somebody did something to get a very strong emotional reaction.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:27.160]   But that's the same word that is used here to describe somebody who is deliberately contemplating
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:34.720]   and carrying out how my behavior is going to provoke you to do the same.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.780]   And he says not to do this passively, but to actively contemplate.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.060]   How can I do this?
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.120]   Not forsaking our own assembling together.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.100]   Why do we forsake our own assembling?
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:56.560]   Typically people don't take the assembling seriously because the typical thinking is
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.360]   there's nothing there for me.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.440]   They're not reaching out to me.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.880]   I don't fit in.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.880]   I don't like this.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   I don't like that.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   So there's nothing for me.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:13.040]   Typically when we don't value assembly is because we are self-centered.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:20.560]   But he says to consider, to think carefully, plan out to provoke others to love in good
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.400]   deeds and not forsaking the assembly of other people, not being self-centered as is the
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.760]   habit of some, but encouraging one another.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:35.480]   And all the more as you see the day drawing near to provoke.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:41.440]   I remember back in college I was doing quiet time in this passage and I was taught that
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:48.600]   whenever I do quiet time that I need to make a practical application, which we should always
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   do.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.280]   If you read the Bible and you never get to the therefore, you never practice what you're
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.920]   reading, it just becomes a lot of knowledge.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.600]   And a lot of knowledge ends up after all it does is puff you up.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.400]   So I sat there and I made a how can I deliberately provoke other people?
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.560]   As some of you guys know, my spiritual gift is not encouragement.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.920]   Some of you guys who are snickering know who I am.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.680]   It's not because I don't want to be.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.440]   And I really wish I was more encouraging.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.920]   In fact, I wanted to name one of my kids Barnabas.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.880]   Because I wanted one of my kids to be son of encouragement.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:34.480]   So far, Isaiah has the best chance.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.240]   And even when I'm trying to be encouraging, people get hurt.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.440]   So I know that that's not my gift.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.000]   I know that.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.720]   So how can I practice this?
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.120]   So in my limited imagination, I went out and bought a bag of lollipop.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120]   This is back in college.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.840]   So I would carry it in my pocket.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   And then whenever I ran into somebody or felt the need to encourage,
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.200]   since my words are usually useless in encouragement,
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.480]   I would just give them a lollipop.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.800]   And they were all weirded out.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.000]   They're very weirded out by my behavior.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.480]   But that was my application of this passage.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:18.120]   How can I provoke other people to be encouraging, to love other people?
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:24.320]   Some of you are very provoking.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.080]   I see some of you who are very intentional.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.520]   When you see a newcomer, you don't turn your eyes.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.040]   Because of typical people, because it's awkward.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.080]   Because you don't know these people.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.160]   And you make eye contact.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.000]   And you've got to say hello.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.520]   But some of you, I notice, you go out of your way to be welcoming.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.280]   You're so hospitable.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   And you provoke me.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.880]   When I watch your behavior, I'm provoked.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.600]   Some of you are genuinely hospitable.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.200]   I see strangers and people who are new, people that you're not comfortable with.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.920]   And not because they're your age and you have similar things to share with them.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.280]   But just because you're hospitable.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.800]   And the word hospitable basically means to love strangers.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.280]   And some of you are so good at that.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.800]   Hospitality isn't inviting a lot of your friends over to your house.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.600]   The word hospitality means to bring people who are not like you,
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.480]   who are strangers, who are outside of your comfort zone.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.680]   And I see some of you who are very provoking.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:25.840]   That's what it means to provoke, that your behavior in your life is provoking
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.200]   other people to do the same.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.640]   You know, I know some people in this church who are very intentional with their
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.480]   finances.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.640]   You know, aside from the tithing and the gift that they give to the church,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.920]   they have, there's people in our church who've set aside thousands of dollars just
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.200]   in case somebody is in need.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.240]   And so whenever there's a need, they're the first ones to call or email and say,
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.000]   "Hey, I have this money set aside.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.480]   Can I use this for this?"
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.440]   See, those are the type of things that he's talking about to provoke other people.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.080]   That by our behavior, by our life, intentionally, that it causes other people
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.440]   to do the same.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.760]   You know, when we went to India this winter, out of the 15, I think there was
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.960]   about 11 of us who were married.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.400]   And we had a lot of couples.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.640]   You know, for the first time in any of our mission trips, we had more couples at the
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.720]   trip than we had singles.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.520]   And the reason why that was so encouraging to me is because a lot of these couples,
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:30.680]   deliberately, they come out because they want to use their marriage to glorify God
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.520]   together.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.920]   And so, you know, we had one couple who just got married, and the very first trip
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.800]   that they took outside of their honeymoon is they wanted to use their money and time
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.680]   to use what God has given them to provoke other people and to make sure that it's
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.680]   being deliberate.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.920]   Because typically, obviously, when you get married, you want to travel,
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.800]   you want to eat good stuff, and that's just how we are.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.760]   You know?
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.880]   But these young couples, and again, it wasn't just one.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.960]   We have other couples in our church who wanted to make sure that early on in their
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.040]   marriage that they wanted to establish Christ at the center.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:14.400]   And just being with them provokes me, that they want to be deliberate with their youth.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:20.720]   One of the things that I always think about that provokes me to want to do better and
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.360]   to make the most of every opportunity, I remember years ago, back in college,
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.360]   a group of us went up to Oregon to share the gospel.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.080]   And we were out this one particular park, and it was filled with people,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.640]   and there was this little tiny bridge that went over the stream.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.240]   It's probably the best place to go to kind of relax and look at the scenery.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.480]   I saw this old man that was standing up there.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.320]   He told me later on that he was about 86 years old.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.480]   And clearly, he was not in good health.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.560]   So he was leaning on the bridge, and he was just hanging out, just watching.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.000]   So I decided to go over there and share the gospel with him.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.960]   And so I started going over the bridge illustration about, you know,
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.400]   "All have sinned, fall short of the glory of God."
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.840]   And it took me about 10 minutes to go through.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.200]   Then after I was done, you know, I was expecting him to, "Okay, you know,
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.800]   move on your way, kid."
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:14.160]   Instead, he grabbed my hand, and then he reached into his pocket,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.520]   and he took out a bunch of gospel track.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.600]   So I said, "Oh, you're a Christian."
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.560]   So immediately, I thought, like, "Why did you make me, you know,
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.680]   present the whole gospel to you?"
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.360]   And he had a big smile on his face.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.640]   And he said, "I just wanted to see how good you were."
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.440]   So we started talking, and then he said, "The reason why he was there is
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.960]   because he doesn't have the strength to walk around like me.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.800]   He used to do that, but once he got to a certain age, he couldn't.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.960]   So he didn't want to be stuck in his nursing home.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.280]   So he comes out, and he stands on that bridge because that's the best place for
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.560]   people to come.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.360]   And usually, people will come sit there and look at the scenery.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.840]   And when they come, he would strike up a conversation.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.480]   And then he would take out a Bible track and share with them."
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.160]   Man, that was provoking, you know, because evangelism is one of the
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.840]   hardest things to do.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.360]   I know next Saturday, we have an evangelistic team going out and
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.120]   sharing the gospel.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.960]   And our tendency is because we don't like being rejected, "Oh, it's too hot.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.680]   It's too cold.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.080]   I didn't get enough sleep.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.240]   I'm not trained properly."
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.320]   We have all kinds of reasons why we can't do this, we can't do that.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.840]   But here's this man, you know, having a hard time even walking,
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.440]   just standing there, leaning, and waiting for somebody to come.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.120]   Even 32, 33 years later, I'm still talking about this guy because I was
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.800]   so provoked.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.080]   I was so provoked by this old man who was just standing there,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.920]   just being deliberate with the retirement.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:54.680]   See, that's what he means when he says, "To consider, to think,
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.400]   consider how we may provoke one another on toward love and good deeds."
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.360]   Let me give you one more illustration.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.280]   You know, I was reading this week, you know, with the coronavirus going
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.040]   crazy and, you know, a lot of people are concerned, you know,
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.880]   when is it going to come here?
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.560]   What should we do?
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.000]   You know, the epicenter of this is Wuhan, that city where it started.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.160]   And there are over 11 million people, and they're all kind of spread out,
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   and the streets have been completely cleared, nobody is outside.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.960]   Then I read about this small underground church, wanted to make the best
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.800]   of the situation.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.520]   And so they're taking the mask that everybody is looking for,
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.200]   and they have a few boxes.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.480]   And while everybody else is hiding in the building because they didn't want
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.920]   to get affected, it's just natural response.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.800]   We want to protect our children, we want to protect, you know,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.480]   we don't want to, you know, get sick.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.600]   But this church is out on the street with these masks and passing it out to people
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:57.040]   who are in need and using that as an opportunity to share the gospel with them.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.240]   While everybody else is running back into the building and protecting themselves,
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.840]   these people are risking everything and they're out on the street sharing
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   the gospel.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.360]   Man, that was provoking.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:13.320]   Because it is natural human response to want to be safe, want to live,
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.960]   want to be happy to protect our children.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.960]   But it is a God-paid love that causes us to live differently than the rest
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.040]   of the world.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.960]   Ephesians 5, 15 to 16, "Therefore, be careful how you walk,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.120]   not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time because the
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.960]   days are evil."
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   Practical, right?
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.560]   Not to love in theory, but in deed.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:44.040]   Thirdly, we are to love as we love ourselves.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.000]   To what degree?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.880]   Maybe we can practice this God-paid love when my needs are taken care of,
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.480]   when I'm safe and I use the money that I have to make sure that everything in my
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.240]   life is good.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.800]   And then with leftovers, possibly I can begin to think
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.360]   about provoking other people.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.080]   But the Bible is very practical.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:11.840]   It says, "No, we are to love as we love ourselves."
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:19.480]   You know, the God of this age, Satan, God of this age, Satan,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:25.440]   the primary deception, primary temptation, primary rebellion
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.920]   of mankind isn't worship of Satan.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.960]   In fact, years ago, and I shared this before, years ago,
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.600]   I was trying to do a study on Satanic Church and what they believe.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.680]   And if you go to the Satanic website, right?
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.240]   If you go to a Satanic website or website of Satan, or I don't know how to describe
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.400]   that, but Satanic Church's website, right?
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.600]   Their primary creed isn't devil worship.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.160]   If you look at the front page, their primary creed is,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.920]   "Do whatever makes you happy."
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.240]   Okay?
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.040]   So, some of you guys who have extra time today, go look it up, right?
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.920]   Satan.org, right?
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.560]   I made that up.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.440]   You're going to have to look that up yourself.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.200]   Some sort of Satan...
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.000]   Go to their website.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.120]   Their primary doctrine is, "Do whatever makes you happy."
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.440]   And that's the teaching of this world.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.160]   You first.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.520]   You first.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:33.600]   Before there was this #MeToo movement, there's always been #MeFirst.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.080]   #MeFirst.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.760]   In fact, there's a whole song about this.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.360]   Anybody know who Whitney Houston is?
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.560]   Is it already...
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.120]   Really?
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.480]   Anybody know who Whitney Houston is?
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.960]   Wow.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.040]   Are you serious?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.520]   Linos.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.280]   Whitney Houston.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.960]   Okay, look it up.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.680]   She has a song called "Greatest Love of All."
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.360]   You may have heard it.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.080]   Maybe you just don't know her.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.800]   I'm really shocked you guys don't know who Whitney Houston is.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.480]   You know who Michael Jackson is?
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:10.840]   Okay.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:16.320]   Anyway, Whitney Houston was a superstar of our generation, and she has a song called
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.080]   "Greatest Love of All."
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:17.800]   This is what it says.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.520]   And you probably...
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.760]   Many of you may have sung this at karaoke or something, right?
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.280]   Without really understanding what you were singing.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.320]   "I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadows.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.440]   If I fail, if I succeed, at least I'll live as I believe.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.600]   No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity because the greatest
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.440]   love of all is happening to me.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.520]   I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.120]   The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all."
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.560]   How many of you sang that satanic phrase?
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:03.480]   You go home and repent now, right?
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.200]   Yes, this is the theme of our generation.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.520]   This is the theme of human rebellion.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.280]   You first.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.000]   You can practice love with other people, but you first.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.280]   Whatever makes you happy first.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:23.080]   In fact, the Bible describes end times, the primary description of the end times.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.360]   And when it describes end times, we're talking about a sin of mankind that has
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.680]   kind of come to a boiling point.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.960]   And the natural conclusion of man's rebellion, right before Christ comes and
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.120]   brings judgment, this is how it's described.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.840]   2 Timothy 3.1, "But realize this, that in the last days, difficult times will come,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.840]   for men will be lovers of self."
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.600]   Now, let me stop there before I even read anything else because everything else is
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.920]   connected to this.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:57.760]   He says, "The primary rebellion of mankind, when it has reached its full fruit,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.440]   is described as lovers of self."
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:07.400]   It doesn't say worshiper of Satan, idol worshipers.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.000]   I mean, yes, there's sexual perversion that's all connected to this,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.240]   but the primary thing is, if it makes you happy, why is it so bad?
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.680]   There's another song.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.840]   I don't know who sang it, right?
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.560]   Some of you guys probably know, right?
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.400]   If it makes you happy, why is it so bad?
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.960]   And he said, "That's exactly how the end times is described.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.640]   Lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents,
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.640]   ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossip,
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.360]   without self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous,
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.240]   reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God."
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:53.160]   The book ends of how this is described as lovers of self and lovers of pleasure.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.280]   All of this is interconnected.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.920]   It's me first.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.760]   And when that is expressed in the church, they have a form of godliness,
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.720]   although they have denied its power, avoid such men as these.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.760]   Form of godliness.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.200]   The reason why people hold on to a form of godliness where there is no power is
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:15.120]   because what they're ultimately seeking is reputation.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.000]   Reputation.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.040]   So as long as they have a reputation of being godly, as long as they have a
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.720]   reputation of being faithful, that's all they're seeking for because
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.760]   it's self-seeking.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.080]   It's not seeking God's glory.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.680]   So even though there's no power in it, it doesn't matter because they're
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.040]   self-seeking, even in the church.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.880]   But in Romans 12.10, it says, "Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.600]   Give preference to one another in honor."
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   In other words, them first.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.760]   Romans 12.10, "Love one another brotherly at ESV.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.240]   Outdo one another in showing honor."
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.080]   Outdo, compete.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.320]   You know, our natural inclination is to compare and complete.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.960]   You buy a nice house, you go to your friend's house, their house is better.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.280]   And all of a sudden, your house isn't good enough.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.720]   You got a nice Toyota Camry, you're feeling good about it,
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.800]   the fresh car smell, you got a good deal.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.720]   You come to church, somebody's riding a Tesla.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.720]   And now it feels like a piece of junk.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.240]   That's our natural tendency, to compare and to compete.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.720]   He says, "If you're going to compare and compete about anything,
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.520]   compare and compete in love.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.160]   Outdo one another."
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.840]   If you see somebody loving other people saying, "Oh, yeah?"
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.040]   Watch this, right?
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.000]   Quietly, humbly.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.880]   NIV is even clearer.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.840]   "Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.120]   Honor one another above yourself."
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   So this "me first," it contradicts everything about this agape love.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.440]   It is not "me first," it says "them first" in Philippians 2.1-4.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.160]   "Therefore, if there's any encouragement in Christ, if there's any consolation
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.960]   of love, if there's any fellowship of the Spirit, if there's any affection
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.800]   of compassion."
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:15.440]   In other words, if there's even an iota of love for God, if there's even a tiny
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.960]   bit of faith that you believe that God loved you with a love.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.480]   He said, "To practice this love."
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:23.680]   Right?
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.160]   "Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love,
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.440]   united in spirit, intent on one purpose.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:34.240]   Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.160]   But with humility of mind, regard one another as more important
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.320]   than yourself.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.080]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.360]   interest of others."
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.840]   You know, the definition of a good community and a bad community is
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.200]   very simple.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:56.400]   A good community is a community filled with people who are deliberately seeking
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.560]   other people's interests first.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.720]   And so you have a church that are gathering together, contemplating how I'm
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.880]   going to provoke other people toward love and good deeds.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:14.680]   A bad community is a room filled with people waiting for others to provoke them,
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.640]   waiting for others to initiate.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.440]   And again, when you have a church filled with people self-seeking,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.760]   "What do they have for me?
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.520]   What did I get?
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.480]   Nobody's reaching out to me.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.640]   I don't fit in.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.080]   And nobody's doing anything for me."
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.800]   And you got a church filled with these people, you have a bad community.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.600]   You got a frustrated community.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.720]   And eventually, that community falls apart because they begin to forsake their
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.000]   own assembly.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.920]   It goes...
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.080]   That's applied to everywhere.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.840]   That is the definition between a good marriage and a bad marriage.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.960]   Like I said, easy to talk about, hard to practice, but at the core of good
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.360]   marriage, I mean, you can go to a bookstore and you can find hundreds of books,
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.520]   maybe thousands of books to have good marriage.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.040]   But the biblical principle is very simple.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.560]   The biblical principle is very simple.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:13.000]   Stop saying, "What about me?"
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Stop saying that.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.800]   If there is any affection, if there's any love, if there's any compassion,
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:25.440]   if there's any connection with God, make my joy complete, right?
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.160]   Make my joy complete and have the same mind of Christ, who being equal with God
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.960]   in every way, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.040]   but he gave himself.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:35.680]   He emptied himself.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.080]   He became nothing.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.320]   Not only did he not touch his glory, he humbled himself, became a man.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.160]   Not only did he become a man, he humbled himself even further than that,
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.480]   was crucified on the cross, most humiliating thing, most painful thing
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.000]   that a man, even the humblest of man, could have experienced.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.440]   He said, "The highest of the being experienced the lowest of humiliation,
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.200]   all so that you and I can have eternal life."
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:07.640]   If there's any connection to that, he says, "Therefore."
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.680]   Therefore, practice this love that we sing about, first and foremost,
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.480]   with our wives.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:22.000]   A good marriage is two people who are together, sacrificially loving each other.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.880]   To love somebody that you may be sharing the same bed with and you're constantly
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.000]   saying, "She doesn't deserve it.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   She doesn't deserve it."
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.760]   She doesn't deserve it, but neither do you.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.160]   My children don't deserve it.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:42.080]   You're absolutely right, but neither do you.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.240]   And so, the application of redemption in our lives is to practice this
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.320]   agape love.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.240]   Not me first, but them first.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.920]   And then finally, he says that we are to love as the ultimate and final goal
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.240]   because it fulfills all the law.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.200]   Romans 13:8, "Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another,
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.040]   for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law."
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.960]   Okay, let me stop right here, okay?
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.360]   Because, you know, in a church, I mean, our schedule is so packed.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.480]   You know, we have Bible studies, we have prayer meetings, we have counseling,
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.440]   we have, you know, we have service team meeting, logistics meeting,
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.920]   we have children's meeting, and we have enough to keep us busy every day
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.440]   from morning till night until we die.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.160]   And in and of itself, there's nothing wrong with any of that.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.240]   All of these things are efforts to build up the kingdom of God.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:41.040]   But if we forget the primary purpose and primary goal of why we do this is to
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.320]   elevate the love of Christ, then you missed the whole point.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.120]   Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 1 to go back to Ephesus and fight with these
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.680]   false teachers, to teach them not to teach false doctrine,
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.440]   but in the context of commissioning him to this spiritual battle,
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:04.920]   he reminds him in 1 Timothy 1, 5, "But the goal of our instruction is love."
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.040]   The goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart, good conscience,
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.240]   and a sincere faith.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:17.120]   So if the goal of even preaching right God, even fighting against wrong doctrine,
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:29.920]   is love, then that has to be the litmus test that we examine everything.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.880]   Before we talk about discipline and how many people are coming to church or how
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.040]   many times I share the gospel, before we examine any of that,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.600]   the first and foremost that we need to examine is, is this love in me and am
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.840]   I practicing this love?
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.320]   The goal of right doctrine is love.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.280]   The goal of spiritual battle is love.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:58.760]   The goal of discipleship is love.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.080]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:07.200]   If you go out of this room, say, "Yes, I mean, agape love is beautiful,"
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.200]   and you're just going to suck it up, right?
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:10.760]   You're going to suck it up.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.280]   There's some...
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.840]   I can think about four or five people that I need to put up with, you know.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.400]   "I'm going to be a good Christian.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.160]   I'm going to do something."
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.120]   I mean, it will destroy you.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.000]   I mean, you're hard.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.080]   I mean, you're going to be wrestling back and forth, and it may be a good battle,
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.640]   but you're going to be frustrated.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.920]   Because the strength to love other people is not in us.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.160]   It's not in us.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.920]   This is an alien love.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:46.680]   That only those who have seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ in response
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.520]   to that love, we love.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.360]   We love because He first loved us.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.320]   And that's why the book of Ezekiel, it says, "In the new covenant,
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.680]   I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you,
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:06.240]   and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh."
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.720]   You can't love God with a heart of stone.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.880]   You can't mold stone.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.760]   And that's why our heart needs to be turned to flesh.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   So let me take a step back here and ask you a basic question.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.520]   Do you know this Christ?
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.640]   And that may be a strange thing to answer with a bunch of people who come to church
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.480]   and hear me every Sunday, but that really is the fundamental question.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.320]   Do you know this Christ?
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.760]   Have you been affected by this love?
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.800]   Is there a true connection in the Spirit?
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.760]   Is the agape love that you sing about and talk about, is it in theory?
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:46:00.080]   Or have you truly been born again?
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:07.400]   Until we meet this resurrected Christ, this is not an imperative
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.840]   that you're going to be able to practice.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:17.440]   Until we are broken over our own sins, until we see the depth of our depravity,
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:22.640]   and until we see the glory of what it meant for Christ to die for us,
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:28.200]   and the hope that we have in His name because of it, and as a result,
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.320]   we desire to declare His glory with that same love.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.280]   Do you know this Christ?
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.000]   Have you assumed all your life because you attended church,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.800]   your parents were faithful, that you were baptized at a certain age,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.720]   that you gave and you were serving, maybe you were a leader at a church
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.760]   at one point, and we just assumed.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.680]   But do you know this Christ?
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:58.280]   Are there genuine fruits of this in your life?
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:04.760]   My prayer is that not a single person in this room, not a single person
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:13.920]   in this room knows this Christ in theory, holding onto a form of godliness
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.040]   with no power.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.560]   You know, as I conclude, maybe asking like, "You know,
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.880]   you said you're going to be talking about knowing Him and making Him known.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.560]   What does this have to do with evangelism?"
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.200]   Everything.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.160]   Because until the love of Christ is what propels us to declare His glory,
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:40.760]   all we are doing is regurgitating information, just like a good sales
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.480]   presentation.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.240]   Somebody told us what to say, and I'm going to take this script and I'm going
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.920]   to give it to somebody else.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.080]   There is no power in that.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:55.720]   The power of the gospel is a changed life, is a power of God unto salvation
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:01.160]   to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:06.240]   You know, when we go to India, you know, again, going to India is,
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.480]   the older I get, it's becoming very tiring, like physically.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.120]   16 hours on one flight, and then I get another four or five hours,
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.800]   and then we get on another car to go five hours, and then we're at a hotel.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.240]   It's fairly comfortable, you know, and the food is delicious, you know,
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:25.160]   and then we drive another hour and a half to two hours, and we have to make sure we
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.000]   go to the bathroom because, you know, the bathroom facility is not good,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.120]   and we're always kind of under pressure.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.440]   We don't know what's going to happen, especially with the persecution.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.680]   But man, every time I go, I feel like every single second I spend
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.920]   there is not wasted.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.320]   You know, let me give you an example.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.040]   You know, every time we go, you know, it's not a warm response, right?
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.240]   They're not hostile, but it's not necessarily a warm response.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.480]   It's almost kind of skepticism.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.200]   What are these people doing here?
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.280]   And I remember the very first year we went, we went to this one particular
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:01.000]   village, and we started sharing the gospel with our testimony, and you could tell that
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.200]   the village people were upset.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.920]   The men began to yell at their children and their wives to get out of the tent,
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:07.920]   and they were chasing them out.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.720]   We didn't speak the language, but we knew that it was a very negative response.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.080]   So we got kind of nervous because there was a lot of people, a lot of men sitting
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.920]   back there upset.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.400]   And it was clear because we started sharing the gospel openly.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.160]   Well, the village leader who happened to be sitting there, he stands up and he calms
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.320]   everybody down, and he's speaking their language, and he says a few things,
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.920]   and then everybody just kind of calms down.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.240]   The noise subsides.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.840]   We're able to finish the work, finish our presentation.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.040]   Then after it was done, you know, we went to the interpreters,
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.600]   and we asked them, like, "What did he say?"
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.120]   And clearly, they seemed angry.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.800]   And sure enough, it confirmed what we were seeing.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.640]   They were upset.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.480]   And then the village leader stood up, and he basically calmed them down,
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.320]   saying, "These are our guests.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.840]   And the only reason why we were in that village is because that village leader
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.600]   asked us to come because he knew we were doing a medical camp."
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.720]   So he kind of calmed them down and said, "They're our guests.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.040]   Don't treat them poorly.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.200]   You know, they're talking about Jesus, but he's, you know, he's not different
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.120]   than our gods, and he was trying to, you know, like, water things down,
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.040]   and then calmed everybody down.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.320]   So we're a bit nervous.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.800]   You know, how are they going to react when we begin to actually do the work?"
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.080]   So they got out of the tent.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.640]   They're just kind of walking around, curious.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.720]   It's like, "Man, you know, I hope nothing happens here."
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.280]   But once we started the work, slowly, they started coming and standing
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:24.880]   in the line.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.680]   Then we started doing eye exams and, you know, wound care, VBS was going on.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.840]   And so after about two to three hours, we had a packed house.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.520]   And these same guys who were angry were coming and standing in line,
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.280]   and one by one, they're getting their eyes checked, wound care.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.240]   And then the most common response that we get, not only from that village,
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:51.520]   but even all the other villages, is, "Why do you guys do this?"
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.400]   He said, "We thought that you came here just to see the Christians.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.200]   But when we started to see that, you started opening up to Hindus."
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.320]   And he said, "Man, you guys are doing great things."
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.440]   And they would hold our hands, just grateful and thankful.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:11.920]   And they said, and this is the common thing that we hear, he said,
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:17.560]   "Even our government doesn't come out this far because they're so remote."
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:23.040]   In fact, the poor village people in India, the lowest caste people,
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.560]   you know what they're called officially?
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.360]   They're called untouchables.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.240]   It's not a derogatory term.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.480]   That's actually what they call themselves.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.600]   So they'll say, "Oh, we're all untouchables."
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.960]   And say, "Even our own government doesn't come this far.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.640]   And you Christians are coming and you're willing to share all this,
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:51.520]   and all these doctors and medical professionals and people come in here to do this."
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:56.000]   And so every time that happens, it gives a platform for the pastors
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.360]   to share the gospel with them.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.960]   Why do you do this?
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:07.880]   And the answer is, because the God that we love did this for us.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   So this agape love that we practice in the church is the platform
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.400]   in which we stand to proclaim the love of Christ.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.840]   We cannot be a good witness if the love of Christ is just theoretical in speech only.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.640]   It has to be the character of who we are.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.000]   That's why this is directly linked to our vision.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.080]   We want to proclaim Christ.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.360]   We want as many non-Christians, we want as many family members to come to Christ,
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.080]   know this Christ, and have their sins forgiven,
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.880]   and have the hope that can only be found in Jesus Christ.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.560]   But the only way that we can have a platform to do this
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.280]   is if we also practice what he practiced with us.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.600]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:03.600]   So my prayer for us as we go forward is, you know, some of you guys are very smart,
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:08.120]   you have a lot of experience, maybe you have resources,
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.520]   and all of these things can be used for God's glory.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:16.280]   But in the end, the Bible says, "If you want to bear fruit," what does he say?
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.720]   "You have to abide in me.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:24.200]   You cannot bear fruit until you abide in me."
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:32.240]   And the most central thing that God calls us to abide is his agape love.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.320]   And I pray that that would be our pursuit,
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.760]   and that would be what we are known for, that Christ may be exalted.
