[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   You didn't bring like a phone with you or have a peripheral.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.320]   We sent the handout via electronic copy on the email.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.600]   But if you want to write on something, I placed some blank pieces of paper on the back table
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.480]   and you guys can get up and get those now.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.960]   Or if you're near the front on this table in the front, I have some blank pieces of
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.580]   paper too.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.000]   And while you guys get a little bit situated, it's a good opportunity to kind of highlight
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.280]   some of our announcements that we have for this week.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   For those of you who are new to the church or you have friends who are, our membership
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.640]   class, the basis of Christianity is starting this Sunday.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.640]   Okay, so 930.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.480]   All they have to do is bring their Bible and pen and meet in the back room of the office.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.280]   Also for the new visitors, we have a welcome lunch this Sunday after church at one.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.800]   So again, if you have friends who are new to the church, encourage them to come.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.880]   I just want to also highlight that two things, the Thanksgiving potluck is taking place on
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.560]   the 20th, so please make sure you mark your calendars and that you sign up to bring something.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.580]   The signup is going to go out on email, but it's also on our Facebook site as well.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.500]   And lastly, as you know, the holiday outreach ministries are happening.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.840]   If you have any questions about those things, please contact Grace Kim.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.680]   And there's like a list of those things also on the Facebook as well.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   Okay.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   All right.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.840]   So again, apologies for not having the handout.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.760]   We had some technical issues with the printer.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.280]   So okay.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.360]   So, so far, um, the, this, the series of classes that we've been taking, we've been talking
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.760]   about a high view of God initially.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.640]   Remember and recall that we talked about the greatness of his power, the greatness of his
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.920]   majesty, the greatness of his glory to the degree that in so many occasions through the,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.280]   throughout history, mankind would be in fear of him.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.400]   They'd have experiences where if people approached him, however they wanted, there would be consequences
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   for those things.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   Right?
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.240]   So we learned about the greatness of God.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.360]   And then underneath that, it was the idea then if God is so holy, then his word that
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.200]   proceeds from him is holy as well.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.280]   That the word of God then is deserving of the kind of attention, right?
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.920]   The kind of clarity, the desire to obey just as God himself is deserving because of his
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   greatness.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.280]   Well, today as we kind of follow along with that, we're going to jump now into a new topic
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   about the church.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.880]   That namely, if God being so holy and for lack of better words, like God being so great,
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.520]   if he is so great, then so is the place where he desires to be present, namely the church.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   Right?
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.840]   If God is so great, then anything that is his is great as his word is and so is his
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.340]   church.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.240]   And so as we talk about transitioning into the next couple of series, I wanted to make
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.800]   that connection that appropriately when we think about the church, we have to think about
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.960]   it appropriately in light of God because this is his church.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   Amen?
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.240]   Now in thinking about the church, we want to title today's lesson, the right view of
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.840]   his church, a high view.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   Okay?
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   And the reason why I thought of it like that, because I could have just said a high view
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.160]   is I didn't want to, I wanted to make the case in point that we're not just trying to
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.000]   elevate and push this as like, hey, this is something that our church has as one theological
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.160]   point that we always push.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.960]   My point with that and entitling this the right view, the high view is to say that what
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   is appropriate, clear, and correct is to have a high view of God's church, right?
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.720]   That what is appropriate, clear, and correct is to have a high view of the church.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.260]   Now I want to begin with a little bit of a participation with us.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.740]   There are many metaphors in the Bible for the church, right?
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.980]   Metaphors meaning naming out one, a family, okay?
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.840]   That the collective believers that are assembled together, that they're called various things
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.480]   in an illustrative way using metaphors.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.240]   If you guys can just throw out whatever comes to mind right now, okay?
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.200]   Let's just throw them out and list the various metaphors that the Bible uses to describe
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.480]   the church.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.640]   So we have got the family, what else?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.040]   The bride of Christ, what else?
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.800]   The body of Christ, what else?
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.040]   There's a bunch more.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.720]   The temple, excellent.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.200]   Connected to the Old Testament, God calls the church the temple.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.760]   In fact, he makes it a point to say you are the temple, right?
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.400]   And it shall be holy.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   What else?
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.280]   There's more, there's lots more.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   So what was that?
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   Children?
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280]   Building, excellent.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   Building, okay, definitely.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:33.160]   In the book of Ephesians, it talks about this building that's being pieced together, okay?
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.680]   And the chief cornerstone being Christ.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.120]   There's other illustrations between our relationship and Christ and how it describes the New Testament
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.840]   body of believers.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:51.560]   Excellent, Jesus is the good and great shepherd and we are his sheep.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.040]   Connected to the temple, those who are serving are the priests, right?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.800]   We're called a priesthood.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.440]   Think about this, we're even called like a nation, so to speak.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.800]   We are a people, right?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.920]   We're even called in a sense a kingdom, where Christ is the king and we are his kingdom.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.280]   And the list could actually go on in the way that the scriptures describes the church,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.560]   the New Testament body of believers.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:25.080]   Now some of these metaphors can be applied to, again, the collective body of believers
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.440]   in the New Testament as a whole, but then other of these metaphors really speak highly
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.920]   of the local community, the church, right?
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.880]   Now all of this coming together gives us a very vibrant and dynamic picture of the church.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.560]   So by way of application, when you see something described, not in just one way, but not in
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.440]   just two, three ways, but you see something described in so many illustrative terms, you
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.540]   realize that this is incredibly important, right?
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.460]   So I want to make an application to you that there are things in the Bible to which God
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.820]   wanted to make so clear, so emphatic, that he doesn't just repeat it in redundancy, he
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.860]   gives vibrant illustration.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.580]   And so what we're supposed to do by application is we're supposed to appreciate the beauty,
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.460]   the richness of the church, right?
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.520]   You're supposed to look into the depths of the church.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.860]   You're supposed to be engaged and involved in the life of the church.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.100]   So what I'm saying is, think about this for a moment.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:39.640]   What else in our modern day do we give lots of different terms and illustrations and maybe
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.360]   even more like slang words for?
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.520]   In my mind, when I was asking myself that question, there's only two things that come
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.600]   to mind.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.360]   Love and money, okay?
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   Love and money.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.320]   Where money can be talking like cheddar, you know, the dough, whatever it may be.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.260]   You have all these like different terms for money.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.220]   And then with love, there's all these different terms, right?
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.220]   And especially with different songs.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.140]   Your love is like this, like a river.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.220]   Your love is like that.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.220]   Your love is like the morning sunrise.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.860]   And then we have terms for the one that we love, you know?
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.220]   Shall I compare thee to a midsummer day or whatever it may be, right?
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.220]   Or mid-November day.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.020]   It's like crazy hot out these days.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:28.140]   All I'm saying is, when there's something that is very important, especially important
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:34.340]   to us, we tend to illustrate and use so many terminologies.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.420]   My point is to God, the church is so important.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.260]   It's His, it is His love.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.020]   It's described as His bride.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:49.620]   And so therefore, I want to reiterate that point, is do you have an appreciation for
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.620]   the New Testament church as God would, right?
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.940]   Or as God views the church?
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.020]   And so I want to start off there and say this.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:06.780]   So when something is precious, when something is valuable, what ends up happening is there's
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.740]   a weightiness, okay?
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.300]   There's a weightiness.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:17.920]   So on the outline, the first point should have been the metaphors of the church, application
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.620]   is we appreciate the richness, and now we're coming to this idea that when it's rich like
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.580]   that, when it's precious like that, there is a weightiness.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580]   There is a weightiness.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:33.100]   Do you guys remember that when we were studying the doctrines of God, we said that God was
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.080]   glorious, right?
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.820]   And some of these terms are really big and lofty, and sometimes it's hard for us to grasp.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.820]   What does that mean?
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.780]   Like glory, you know?
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:52.380]   And the thing about it is, in the Hebrew term, it meant weighty, weighty, right?
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.020]   And so I want us to think about that, that there is a sense to which the New Testament
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:02.020]   church, the local church, has a weightiness about it because of its preciousness.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.900]   Weightiness referring to its great value.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.660]   Weightiness referring to its kind of, you know, the way that we should approach it,
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.660]   right?
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.700]   Where it's not just a common thing.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.260]   Common things like, for example, the pens that you have.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.220]   Seriously, people, like, they buy boxes of pens and they go through it like nothing.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.220]   Why?
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.840]   Because it's so common.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.700]   But then there are things where we don't treat it as common.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.780]   It's not your everyday thing.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.180]   Likewise, the church is described that way.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.180]   Okay?
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.980]   So, one of the passages that I would like us to turn to, we're going to flip to a lot
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.460]   of passages as we're doing kind of a topical study here.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:47.340]   Please turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 16 through 17.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:54.340]   1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 16 through 17.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:00.100]   This passage to us teaches us that there is this weightiness about the church.
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.100]   Okay?
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.780]   Now, as you guys turn there, you guys know that there has, the church in Corinth, although
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:13.380]   it was a rapidly growing church in a really, like, a pivotal location, it had lots of problems.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.460]   And a lot of the problems began with, there were divisions and there were, you know, fractions
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.920]   within the church.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.260]   And then this is what Apostle Paul says, verse 16 through 17.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.860]   Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's spirit dwells in you?
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:35.260]   If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him for God's temple is holy and you
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.580]   are that temple.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.060]   Right?
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:45.580]   So when you look at that passage, do you feel a sense of weightiness even in the tone?
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:51.780]   In that passage, it gives a definition, almost a definition describing the essence of the
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.780]   church.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.340]   You are a temple.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.660]   And the essence of it is that you are a temple having the spirit, the presence of the spirit
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.220]   in you and you are holy.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.100]   You are to be holy.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:10.100]   But what's contained in it also in that little phrase or in that little verse is also a warning,
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.180]   right?
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:18.380]   There's a warning of, and you better not seek to diminish or destroy this temple.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.620]   Otherwise, what?
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.900]   I will destroy you.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.860]   And so within that, there's almost a heavy weightiness.
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:31.380]   Now in order for us just to kind of get the sense of it for the sense of effect, I want
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:37.720]   to share with you that sometimes I have fantasies and I think a lot of the guys might relate
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   to this.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.340]   I don't know if the sisters might, but I have what's called a hero fantasy.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.500]   Have you ever shared that?
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.180]   The hero fantasy where essentially like as I'm driving or something and I kind of get
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.700]   lost in daydreaming, I started imagining that there's this goon, you know, it's like, I
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.100]   don't know, like an eye patch or something coming after my family.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.980]   And he's like, I'm going to come get you, you know, or it's just some guy who's happened
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.780]   to threaten my, the wellbeing of my wife.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.660]   Maybe he's hitting on her or maybe he's, you know, acting all, acting up in front of her
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.020]   and whatnot.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.160]   And then my hero fantasy comes in.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.860]   Where it's just like, he didn't see me coming, but all of a sudden I come in like, that's
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.860]   my wife.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.460]   And then, and then like in my fantasy, like the brothers all of a sudden jump in and they're
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.460]   holding me back.
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.940]   It's like, you better not let me see you here, man.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.060]   And then like in my fantasy, I'm the, I'm the hero.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.580]   You guys never, ever.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.460]   I have those hero fantasies a lot when I'm saving my kids or I'm saving my wife, that
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.460]   kind of thing.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:45.260]   You know, I don't know, you know, if that, that verse should be taken in that way, but
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:50.700]   there's definitely a sense of all the metaphors that we're talking about.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.940]   He talks about the church as his precious children.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.900]   He talks about as his household, right?
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.500]   He says he uses even that term household.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.020]   And then he talks about the church as his bride and apostle Paul says this bride should
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.540]   be kept pure for God, right?
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.900]   Then do we dare test whether God's threat, you know what I mean?
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.500]   Is real.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.100]   Do we dare test whether that's actually a serious thing or not?
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.540]   And that's what I'm talking about here is the church is precious in God's eyes and we
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:29.080]   should have a high view then of what is God's, right?
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.820]   We should have a high view of what is God's.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.780]   So therefore when you, when you think about it that way, that this is, this is God's thing
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.580]   described in so many different metaphors, household, children, flock, all that kind
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.580]   of stuff.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.740]   And then you realize that all of this is a love service terms.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.460]   It is incredibly precious to the eyes of God.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.480]   And then we're supposed to have likewise that weightiness when you approach it.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.580]   Like somebody who passes you, recently there's been so many newborn babies and they pass
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.580]   it to you.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.580]   It's like, Oh, she's so cute.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.580]   You know, like you don't handle like that.
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.580]   Why?
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.420]   Because obviously in the immediate context, it's a precious baby.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.860]   So you approach it.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.060]   If you're six, like, Oh, I'm sick.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.660]   I shouldn't even be near that.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.820]   Right?
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.980]   So that's the kind of thing that we want to talk about here in application.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:22.340]   Then when you realize that the church is God's designed, you know, God ordained precious
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.580]   entity, then how should we approach it in application?
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.340]   Well, there's tons, there's tons of application, right?
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.300]   Let me hear some real quick.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.660]   If we're supposed to have a high view of the local church, what are some applications that
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:45.540]   just automatically come from that automatically flow from a high view of the church?
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:53.620]   You guys can just kind of yell it out.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.820]   You should go there.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.820]   What else?
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.820]   Serve.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.820]   Excellent.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:06.180]   Even dress, how you approach it externally, expression wise.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.180]   What else?
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.180]   Yes.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.180]   We're talking about the body.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.180]   Okay.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:17.460]   Let me highlight a couple that I wrote down.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.940]   Obviously there again, there's tons of applications, but let me highlight a couple.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:26.180]   I share this sometimes in BCC class and you guys might have heard me say it, but we should
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.940]   be careful about just criticizing the church brazenly.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.620]   Right?
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.700]   And I highlight that a little bit because there was a time when I was learning like,
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.300]   Oh, this is biblical ministry.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.460]   And then all of a sudden I found myself like, and that church and that church and that church
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:46.260]   like, you know, and then you realize, imagine this, there are a lot of new parents, you
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.100]   know, in our church and stuff like that.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.740]   And sometimes babies cry.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.740]   And then you look over, it's like, why are they crying, spoiled brat?
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:59.780]   And you just like say stuff like that without thinking about what the parents are thinking.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.460]   Right?
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.660]   And you might have this attitude of like, well, what?
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.980]   He's crying.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.300]   You know?
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.660]   But is that actually mature?
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.180]   No, it's not a right understanding.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.260]   It's not a right understanding of who the parent is, who the baby is to that parent.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.740]   Likewise, we shouldn't be just outlandishly criticizing the church, this and that and
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.820]   this and that, because every church has problems and we are a work in progress that God is
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.140]   building in this mysterious way.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:32.620]   God is building the church and he's given it time to develop and mature with all of
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.660]   its faults.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:40.100]   Another one, there's a passage in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 10 to 13.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.500]   You guys should be already kind of close to there, right?
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   Let me read it for us.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.180]   1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 10 to 13 says this, "According to the grace of God given
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.060]   to me, like a skilled master builder, I laid a foundation and someone else is building
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.500]   upon it.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.400]   Let's each one take care how he builds upon it.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.340]   For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.740]   Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.420]   straw, each one's work will become manifest, for the day will disclose it because it will
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:19.060]   be revealed by fire and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done."
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.440]   Okay?
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.220]   So here, the admonition is really clear, right?
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.460]   Let's be very careful how we build this church.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:37.060]   Now in more modern days, in recent times, there have been so many conferences and so
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.060]   many opinions.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.940]   "Hey everybody, every pastor, let's get together and let's talk about how to make this thing
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.020]   work.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.300]   Let's talk about what are some innovative ways that we can do X, Y, and Z.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.820]   Is that bad and wrong?
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.820]   No it's not."
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.380]   But why is that the first thought?
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.420]   Shouldn't the first thought be, "How does God want this thing to function?
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.660]   What does God desire?
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.340]   What kind of body does He desire and want?
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.540]   What kind of bride is He building us to be?"
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.540]   Why is the first question like, "Hey, let's make this thing work somehow."
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:17.020]   And in all my honest opinion, I mean, I think people should just stop kind of thinking that
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.100]   they want to do grand, innovative stuff like, "Hey, we just need to move this into another
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.100]   era."
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:28.540]   Because essentially, the church has been trying to do the same thing for hundreds and hundreds
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.540]   of years.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.860]   Glorify and love God.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.980]   Now again, are some of those questions wrong or wicked or something?
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.980]   No.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.660]   But upon the wrong priority and wrong sequence, it can lead you astray.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.320]   Here's another one.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.980]   We definitely have to desire to keep the church pure.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.060]   To keep the church as pure as possible.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.980]   If you flip over to 1 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 15 through 16.
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:04.180]   Okay, 1 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 15 through 16.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.660]   Apostle Paul is addressing the issue of sexual immorality.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.860]   And then he says this, "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.500]   Shall I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute?
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:26.300]   Do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her?"
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:33.100]   Now he is talking about the individual sin of eliciting prostitution.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.500]   But then the metaphor that he's using is, "Do you not realize that you are one member
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.020]   of the collective body?"
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.420]   That the individual sin of sexual immorality is what is causing the church as a collective
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.820]   body to be sexually immoral, right?
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.420]   And he's saying, "How can this be in the body of Christ?"
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:21:00.300]   And so I want us to realize that our individual sin is contributing to the purity of the whole,
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   right?
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.100]   And so we have to make sure that we keep those things in mind.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.060]   Now again, those are just some of the things that I'm highlighting.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.140]   But the applications can keep going on.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:16.100]   If we view the church in a high light, you know, in the kind of appropriate way, there
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.180]   are tons of applications that we can think of.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.540]   Now I want to switch gears here and say this.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.460]   We're talking a little bit about how God has designed things to be.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.580]   What is his intention for the church, right?
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.660]   Well I want to say this statement, I'm going to repeat it twice.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:41.380]   God's design is that through the church, the fullness of Christ would be proclaimed.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:49.260]   God's design is that through the church, the fullness of Christ would be proclaimed.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:55.460]   This is summarized in Ephesians chapter 3, verses 7 through 13.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:01.300]   Ephesians chapter 3, verses 7 through 13.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.780]   I'm going to read this for us here, Ephesians 3, verses 7 through 13, and it says this.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.380]   Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.660]   me by the working of his power.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.020]   To me though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to preach to
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.940]   the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to bring to life for everyone what is
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:28.100]   the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things so that, look at
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   this, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers,
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.660]   the authorities, and the heavenly places.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.900]   This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord,
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.500]   in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:53.900]   So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.380]   So when I said that there's a purpose in the church to proclaim, this passage summarized
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.300]   that beautifully.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:07.140]   That through the church God is making known the mysteries and the wisdom of God, not just
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.740]   to the four nations, but to the whole universe.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.940]   And this was the plan of God from the beginning, he says.
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.300]   This was eternally his plan.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.420]   Does that not up the kind of value and weightiness of the church?
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:32.380]   That God has this intricate, long, and vast plan to use the church to proclaim his glory,
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.380]   right?
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.420]   Here's another verse that you guys should turn to.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:41.340]   It comes from Ephesians chapter one, verses 15 through 23.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.340]   Okay?
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.580]   It's a little bit longer paragraph, but let's read that.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:53.340]   Ephesians chapter one, verses 15 through 23, and it says this, "For this reason, because
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.580]   I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love towards all the saints, I do
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.340]   not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord,
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:06.660]   Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom, of revelation, and
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.780]   the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.460]   is the hope to which he has called you.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.100]   What are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and what is the immeasurable
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:23.340]   greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of his great might,
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.940]   that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at the right
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:32.220]   hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion,
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.140]   and above every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:43.340]   And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church,
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:50.380]   which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:55.320]   And the reason why I pulled together that entire paragraph is because he's praying that
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.940]   we understand the depth of God's redemptive plan.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.700]   He wants to understand the depth of the blessing that is in Christ.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.340]   And then he says this church is the fullness of Christ.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.420]   He says essentially here that all things have been given over to him, and then he says all
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:17.900]   things, he is head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.900]   him.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.900]   Right?
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:28.180]   So earlier when I say that God's meticulous plan is to proclaim the fullness of Christ,
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.180]   right?
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:34.700]   You see that he almost identifies one and one that the church is the fullness.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:39.460]   It's expression, but because we are fully under his reign, because we're fully under
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.820]   his grace, because everything we are is saturated with who he is and our entire identity is
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:51.020]   wrapped up in him, the church collectively is proclaiming Christ's work, Christ being,
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.660]   his nature, his hope, everything found in Christ.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.060]   Here is where that is expressed.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.820]   So what am I saying?
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:11.580]   So therefore you do realize that what we are participating in has an incredible high calling.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:17.620]   I want to remind us about Moses, who we recalled before.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.540]   Moses was a spokesperson for God, and as he was delivering the nation of Israel out of
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.900]   Egypt, he spoke as God's representative.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.300]   So God told Moses, "You will be like God to them."
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.460]   Meaning, you're going to carry God's word to these people and lead them.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.500]   You're going to show them God's way.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:42.860]   Now remember, when they were whining and griping, Moses would pray, then Moses would deliver
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.080]   the word.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.180]   But that one time when Moses was supposed to talk to the rock so that people would have
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:54.560]   refreshing water, she got angry and he took the stick and he slapped the stick.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.820]   And then remember those words when God says, "You did not regard me as holy."
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.700]   That whole drama of water pouring out from the rock, God could have made water gush out
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.260]   from Moses' mouth.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.900]   God could have just filled everybody's mouth with water like this, and be like, "Oop."
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.100]   Or God could have just hydrated their bodies.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.340]   God could have done a million things.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.320]   But God made a representation of how he was going to provide living water for them.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:27.660]   In messing up the glorious representation, Moses was judged.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.300]   What am I saying?
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.980]   The church has a huge calling to proclaim the fullness of Christ.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.740]   The fullness of him.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.140]   And so when we haphazardly, "I don't care.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.140]   I don't know.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.460]   Everybody in the church is doing this, but I don't care.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.780]   Whatever this is my sin, you shouldn't care this is me."
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:52.480]   None of those attitudes call into recollection what God is doing through his church.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:59.720]   And so we have to remember that God, because of the proclaiming and what work he is doing
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.920]   through the church, that there is something vital going on.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:08.280]   We have to have a high view of the calling we have when we are a church.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.880]   So therefore, as application.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.380]   Application of that.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:20.400]   So when we have worship services, when we have baptism services, when we have communion
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.780]   services, you do realize that these things that we do together, these are corporate times
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.800]   of worship unto God.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.080]   And as we do that, we're both giving God an offering corporately together.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.540]   But we're also expressing the spiritual truth.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.220]   God is deserving of all our worship.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:45.740]   And so when it comes down to worship services, yeah, we're going to try to be as intentional
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:51.100]   as possible that the message that is given to you is very clearly from God.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:56.700]   And what we're doing as a church expresses this is what we believe about God.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.980]   And now sometimes, let's think about this for a moment.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:06.780]   You guys have probably heard some people say like, "Hey, you know, we're a no-frills church."
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.540]   No-frills meaning we don't have like crazy ornaments and we don't have like crazy like
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.740]   color mood changing backdrops and all that kind of stuff.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.740]   Maybe we'll get it one day.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.460]   I don't know.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.100]   The thing about it is, are we dedicated to no-frills?
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:28.140]   Like, is that what, you know, the elders and the leadership at this church like, "Hey,
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.980]   our ambition was to be plain because we just like vanilla."
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.380]   You know?
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.380]   We don't want like strawberry shortcake and stuff.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.180]   We just want vanilla because, you know, I don't know.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:46.540]   Is that what you or anybody think of why we are the way we are?
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.660]   And obviously the answer is no.
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:54.540]   Because primarily speaking, it's not about the flavor of anybody, right?
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:30:00.020]   That worship, part of the reason why sometimes we don't do other stuff is because if we believe
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:04.460]   that it's going to take away or detract from the attention of stuff, if it's going to take
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:10.140]   away from the core, what's central, meeting with God, praising, listening to His Word
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.180]   and worshiping, then we don't need it.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.180]   Right?
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:20.100]   And so I'm going to tell you honestly, sometimes what's really annoying is people always wanting
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.820]   to do other stuff with church.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.820]   When people ask, "Why don't we do this?
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.820]   Why don't we do that?
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.820]   Why don't we do this?"
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:30.780]   It's like, okay, I mean, if that's promoting what we believe to be biblically sound for
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:36.500]   the church, what's promoting faith, love and affection for Christ, then amen.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.860]   But if we're just doing that because we want to be like another church, we're just doing
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:45.460]   that because it's not palatable to the flavor desire of our generation and the millennials
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.700]   or whatever it may be, it just doesn't matter.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.260]   You know?
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.900]   And I know right now maybe I'm sounding a little bit like I'm frustrated by that, but
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:02.060]   I'm going to be honest, when I try these days to read up on articles where like, and I try
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.740]   to read up on, let's say, blogs by guys who are young and like guys who are like in growing
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.380]   churches and stuff, just so I know what's going on.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.980]   And then I find myself frustrated.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.140]   I find myself frustrated because as I see their mentality, I almost wonder like, do
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.140]   you forget who the boss of this church is?
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.180]   Whoever walks into somebody else's company and says, "Let's do this, this, and this."
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:29.780]   Or walks into somebody's house and says, "Let's paint that wall purple because I love purple."
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.780]   Nobody does that.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.820]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:40.020]   And so you can expect, you can expect that for the church in terms of its services, what's
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.980]   happening in the church is not going to be simply, as Apostle Paul put it, the foundations
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.300]   of gold, silver, wood, and hay.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.220]   It's going to be the foundations of Christ.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:57.140]   And likewise with baptisms and communions, the baptisms have to represent this focus
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.660]   on the unity with Christ, being buried with him and resurrected.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.140]   It's a celebration of a new identity.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:08.060]   The communion should celebrate, or like remember the work of Christ and celebrate his coming.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.260]   It should be a feast, right?
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:16.980]   And all these things should be done intentionally, not haphazardly, not just because like, "Mm,
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.900]   you're turning about 16, let's get you dunked."
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.820]   I mean, that's, I feel like, I feel kind of sad.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.220]   I kind of like grieve over the fact that some people have those experiences.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:32.740]   It shouldn't be practiced that way, but rather intentionally expressing the truth behind
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.740]   them.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:39.900]   Those practices should be done with a reverence for God, for the church, and the message that
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.900]   it preaches.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.900]   Amen?
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.900]   The next, how much time do we have here?
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.500]   Okay, in the next 10 minutes, we're going to hit a last point.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.500]   Okay?
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:57.300]   So, as you see that, there's a passage that I want to share with you that's given me a
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:06.060]   lot of conviction and sobriety that as the church is so important, right?
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.340]   And that we should have this appropriate view of the church.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:15.460]   Apostle Paul then calls upon leaders to take care of the flock.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.140]   For the sake of time, I'm just going to read it for us here.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.340]   It says in Acts chapter 20, verse 26 through 28.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.820]   Okay, Acts 20, 26 through 28.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:28.220]   "Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, for I did
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.140]   not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.020]   Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit has
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:45.820]   made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood."
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.220]   I love that passage.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.020]   If you ever get a chance, read Acts 20.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.120]   Apostle Paul is about to leave Ephesus.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.740]   And so, the people are crying.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.780]   They're like broken over it and they're like, you know, crying over each other.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.940]   And Apostle Paul gives an exhortation to the leaders of that church as he departs.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.340]   And that's what he says.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.100]   And in it, you find several things.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.340]   In it, Apostle Paul says, "I literally gave everything.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.220]   I gave it all."
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.460]   When he says, "I am clean of everyone's blood," that's what he's saying.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.860]   It's like, "I made sure I gave it all."
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.420]   What's more, he says, "I made sure I gave everything God desired."
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.460]   So I gave the whole counsel of God.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.460]   I didn't just choose.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.540]   I didn't just pick and choose what I wanted to say.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.060]   I gave it all, right?
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:36.540]   And within that, he says this, "But make sure you pay careful attention."
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:41.940]   And then he ups the ante, so to speak, and makes it even more serious by saying, "This
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:46.940]   is the church that Christ shed his blood for."
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:52.800]   If earlier we were talking about how precious, right, how precious is the church, the body,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.100]   we got to think on that level.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:01.820]   This is the flock for which Christ shed his blood and sacrificed, right?
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:06.220]   And it shouldn't be handled haphazardly, but rather with care and concern.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:12.900]   And he admonishes the elders, "You bear that responsibility."
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.900]   So I want to say this.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:20.740]   At Berean, and I believe at every church, that because you have a high view of God,
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.540]   you have a high view of His Word, and you have a high view of the church, the flock
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.220]   of God, and therefore you have to have a high view of leadership.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:37.100]   Those who are entrusted with the responsibility of shepherding and oversight over the church,
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.100]   right?
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:45.580]   And the way I would like to define it is that biblical and good leadership has a high view
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:51.020]   of the responsibility of shepherding, right?
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:56.540]   Now that's not necessarily like a profound thing that I'm saying, but I mean in contrast
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.580]   again to what's common.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.380]   Many people think of leadership as something just simply to aspire to because that's on
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.380]   the next step to maturity.
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.140]   Like I'm not mature yet because I'm not leading anybody, or something like that.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.580]   Or young men who really feel like, "I do want to exercise my strengths."
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.820]   So they see it as what?
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.940]   Opportunities.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.220]   And there is another frustration all the times when I do see that some of my friends read
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:26.260]   articles and these articles say something to the extent of like, "You gotta raise up
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:31.700]   these young guys and girls and you gotta equip them and then give them opportunity and release
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.140]   them and see what happens."
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.140]   You know?
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:41.100]   Now, again, I'm going to say again and caveat that by saying, "Is giving people opportunities
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.380]   like wicked and evil?"
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.380]   No.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.340]   People should have opportunities.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:51.300]   But is that the way the scripture described leadership and church?
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.580]   Right?
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.860]   Is that the way scripture described a few of those who have responsibility over the
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.060]   well-being of God's precious flock, the church?
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.380]   God's precious body?
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.260]   God's precious bride?
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.280]   Is that the way the Bible described it?
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.200]   Is that the way Apostle Paul described it?
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.580]   Is that the way Jesus described it?
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.580]   No.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.140]   It is not at all.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.180]   There's a passage I want to turn, for all of us to turn to.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:22.580]   It comes from 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 1 through 4.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:33.860]   1 Peter chapter 5 verse 1 through 4.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:38.100]   Okay.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.820]   So here in this passage is talking, again, giving another exhortation to the leadership
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.820]   in the church.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.980]   And this passage says this.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:50.900]   So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ,
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.780]   as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed, shepherd the flock of
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:02.020]   God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:08.020]   would have you, not for shameful gain, but eagerly, not domineering over those in your
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.900]   charge, but being examples to the flock.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:16.460]   And when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.780]   Right?
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.540]   There is much to be said from that passage.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.360]   There is a lot to be said.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:28.380]   We can talk about how leadership, again, is it the kind of leadership the world practices?
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.700]   I mean, Jesus even talks about it.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.780]   You know, the people who are authoritative over you, they lord it over you.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.780]   Do this, do that.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.780]   What's wrong with you?
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.780]   You know?
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.780]   If you can't do it, get out of here.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.780]   That kind of thing.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:45.180]   And he says, the people over in this generation, you know, they exercise their authority over
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:53.140]   you and that position, position of leadership is more of simply just power.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.500]   And so people want leadership sometimes because they want power and influence.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:03.220]   But then Jesus teaches, this is not how the body of Christ practices leadership.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.980]   So we can talk about responsibility, and again, I'm not going into super depth about it, but
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:14.060]   the responsibilities for the leadership of the church, it's not simply about tasks.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.060]   Right?
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.500]   It's not simply about, hey, we have an agenda, we have a goal, let's get to it.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.980]   You drive people to do it.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:27.500]   The leadership that Apostle Peter says in this passage, he talks about motive.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.500]   Right?
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.060]   That it should be pure.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.540]   He talks about this desire.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.660]   If you guys ever had those people, I'm going to be honest, even, you know, over at my seminary
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.460]   at Masters, I remember this one guy, he came over and he was like kind of sharing, because
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.460]   we all did this thing like, oh, how did you get to seminary?
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.540]   He was like, I've got the Jonah complex where I really was running, running, running, and
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.860]   then God slapped me and I really felt like I just needed to be here.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:56.540]   So I'm here, you know, and everyone's kind of like, maybe we shouldn't be here.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.980]   Because this passage is like, you should not be under like forced compulsion, but you should
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:06.740]   be willing when you have this hard desire.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.900]   Right?
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.780]   And I'm going to give a free tip to all you single ladies.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:16.340]   To me, what defines a man is a man who wants responsibility.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:21.660]   It's not a guy who's just like burly, like hairy and muscular or something like that.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:28.860]   A man desires responsibility and he will bear the burden on his back of your well-being,
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.540]   future family well-being.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.180]   So if you see brothers who are able to carry the burden and responsibility of others versus
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.160]   those who are like, that's not my problem.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:42.540]   You know the difference between child and adult, boy and man.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.540]   Right?
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:49.020]   So here it says, when an individual has this desire, not for power, influence, and opportunities
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.580]   to go, you know, spread my wings or something like that, but rather I see the needs of the
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.900]   people and I desire to take care of the people.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:01.340]   I have Christ-like love for them and I'm willing to sacrifice for them.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.360]   That's the kind of responsibility this passage says.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:09.740]   So what's that all pointing to when we're talking about motive, their character?
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.500]   Realize that leadership is not so much about, man, that guy is proficient, man, that guy
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.180]   has all his capacities, but rather it's about character.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.900]   The character of the individual.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.140]   Right?
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.940]   And why?
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:28.500]   Why would leadership be about character more so than just ability, proficiency, eloquence
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.340]   or something like that?
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.180]   Because it comes back to this idea, the church is weighty.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.660]   God's flock is precious.
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.660]   God's children are a jewel in his eyes.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:49.220]   The people he's going to give leadership to is the people he will trust.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:55.780]   Did you know that there is this element of trust, both on a humanistic level and on a
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.660]   vertical level with God and man?
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:03.580]   If you'll read through the book of Acts, you'll see that term used very, multiple times.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.340]   This idea of trustworthy.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:11.980]   Apostle Paul says it, "Blessed be God, what a grace that God would consider me trustworthy,
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.180]   entrusted with this, entrusted with that, entrusted with this, entrusted with that."
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.380]   Do you realize that Christ even gave this principle?
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:23.740]   Christ said this, "The good servant, even if he has a little, he will be faithful with
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.820]   little."
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.460]   And when he is faithful with little, what will happen?
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.460]   More will be added.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.220]   But if you're not faithful even with a little, what will happen?
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.880]   Even the little that you have will be taken away.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.260]   That is God's process of leadership.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.140]   Let's see how trustworthy you are.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.620]   Why?
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.700]   Because what I'm about to trust you with is an incredible responsibility.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.060]   As weighty.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.000]   How weighty is it?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.740]   Remember that in the book of James chapter three, verse one, this is what the apostle
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:43:01.580]   said, "Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.940]   will be judged with greater strictness."
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.060]   There is a seriousness.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.580]   There's consequences to these things.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.940]   So the attitude, again, when I read in the articles, like, "Give those guys some opportunities
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.260]   and let them free."
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.100]   It's like, man, what about the well-being of the flock?
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.020]   Are you guys like test subjects?
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.020]   You know?
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.660]   It's like, "Ah, let's try it out."
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:29.180]   Are you guys like, you know, the guppies you play with or whatever it may be?
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.460]   I mean, no.
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.540]   You're precious flock.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:33.540]   Precious children.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.580]   And the metaphors just keep going on.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.960]   And so those who would be leaders must be entrusted.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:48.740]   To the degree that if you actually look, number one, the scriptures is chock full of qualifications.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.220]   Not only in the New Testament, but the Old Testament as well.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.020]   You guys remember the whole idea of Stephen?
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:02.620]   The apostle said to the church, "Select those individuals who are clearly, like evidently
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:08.860]   filled with the Spirit, that it's recognizable by the congregation."
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:13.960]   Remember in the Timothys, how it says, "The elder must be like this, and he must be trustworthy,
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.540]   he must be able to do this, he's self-controlled, respectable, hospitable," and the list goes
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540]   on.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.860]   Again, character upon character.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.780]   But here's an interesting passage I want to read to you.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:33.700]   In 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 10, it says this, "And let them also be tested first.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:39.260]   Then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless."
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.740]   That's really interesting.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:48.140]   And I find that verse to be very contrary to modern practice.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.220]   Right?
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.980]   Modern practice.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.500]   I find it really scary sometimes.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.100]   I go visit, and just even this past Sunday I went to visit another church at night, and
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.020]   then I sometimes go visit, and they don't even know me, but they're like, "Hey, you
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.700]   should come over and preach."
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.700]   Modern practice has with it kind of a backwards way.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.420]   Let's just see by trial and error.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:16.460]   But I'm going to say this, that the scripture calls for a high view of leadership, where
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.900]   one individual is given time.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.220]   And there has to be a proving of that individual's character.
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.420]   There has to be an observation of the fruitfulness in that person's life, and the fact that there
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:31.540]   is actually the working of the Spirit and the Word of God in that individual.
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.140]   Right?
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.740]   And again, I want to come back to this idea.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:40.580]   To me, I think it's a very interesting thing that we see.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:47.020]   That this church that we have, to a lot of people, to a lot of people, this is an incredibly
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.260]   imperfect science.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.260]   You know?
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.100]   This is an incredibly imperfect process.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.900]   And many people might be frustrated by this.
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:46:01.580]   But then on another sense, I want you to just take a moment to think about how meticulously,
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:08.900]   how intricately, how much in detail, how much in broad overview has God designed and given
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.220]   care to this church?
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:16.140]   I pray that every single one of us aligns our thinking and our vision for the church
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.060]   as God would see it.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:23.020]   Not our ambitions, not our visions, not our projected objectives, but God's visions.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:28.540]   If you do not have God's vision for this church and the churches around, you will forever
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   be frustrated.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.500]   You're just going to be frustrated.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.820]   And every time maybe you suggest something or you expect something from the church, you're
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:40.180]   just going to be frustrated because you are not aligned with the trajectory of where God
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.180]   is building this thing.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.180]   Right?
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.640]   So I want to conclude by giving this general call.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:55.020]   Do you personally feel like you have a grasp of God's overarching vision for the church?
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:01.660]   Do you also have a feel for a grasp of the details of that architectural plan?
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:06.920]   Because scripture would have it and say in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, that God has orchestrated
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.780]   this church and God has so designed that even the smallest pieces of the church we join
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:16.060]   together that we would truly be the body of Christ.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:22.460]   It's on us to study the scriptures and to realize, wow, this is a beautiful design.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:34.180]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.660]   Heavenly Father, Lord God, we want to thank you so much.
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:46.020]   We want to thank you that God, you are revealing to us the greatness of your wisdom, the greatness
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:51.340]   greatness of your plans. God there's a sense in which
