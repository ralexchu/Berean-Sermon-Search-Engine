[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, and I'm going to
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.520]   be reading from verse 18 to 24.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:21.240]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 18 to 24.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.560]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 18 to 24, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.080]   For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, and to a blazing fire, and to
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.040]   darkness and gloom and whirlwind, and to the blast of trumpet and the sound of words, which
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.000]   sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.560]   For they could not bear the command, even if a beast touches the mountain, it will be
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.080]   stoned.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.160]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, I am full of fear and trembling.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.400]   But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.480]   and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, who are enthralled
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.920]   in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920]   than the blood of Abel.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.920]   Let's pray.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.360]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.840]   We pray for the weightiness of your word to strike our thoughts, our hearts, and our very
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   lives.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.840]   Ordain these times, Lord God, that we may see a glimpse of who you are, that we may
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.760]   remember who it is that we worship, who it is that saved us, and that who it is, Lord,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.000]   that we are hoping to come, Lord God, and redeem.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   So we pray for your blessing.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Amen.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.200]   I have a tendency, when I watch movies, it's hard for me to stay awake.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.000]   So I have, I think that part of the reason is I don't get good sleep, so I'm kind of
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   perpetually a bit tired.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.720]   And the other part of it is there's like something going on in my head constantly.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   It's hard for me to turn it off.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.520]   So as soon as when there's, you know, I get distracted, I tend to relax.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.880]   And so when I relax, I fall asleep, you know.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.360]   So it's a running joke in my house whenever we watch a movie to see how long it's going
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.080]   to take before I fall asleep.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.800]   You know, the good part of that is I can watch the same movies over and over again.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.640]   You know, and remember when Blockbuster used to be open?
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.160]   Like Esther would tell me to go pick up a movie, and then, you know, I don't know how
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.080]   many times I would come back thinking like, "This movie looks good," and then she would
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.680]   just start laughing.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.760]   You just saw that four months ago, you know, and I just don't remember anything, you know.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   And so that's the benefit of that.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.080]   But the bad part of it is I can't thoroughly explain to you any movie because at some point
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   I fell asleep.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.600]   And I remember very specifically this movie, the movie Up.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.560]   And I forgot how old my children were, but our whole family went to watch it.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.240]   And I remember it started out well with this old man growing old together with his wife,
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.200]   and then I fell asleep.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   And then I woke up and this crazy bird at some top of Grand Canyon with this balloon.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.280]   And for the rest of the movie, it's like, "What is going on?"
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.720]   And I was like, "Esther, what's going on?"
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.880]   She's like, "Just watch the movie."
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.360]   They were so riveted by this movie, and I couldn't even ask.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.160]   So the whole movie, I had no understanding what happened.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.640]   Something happened that caused this man living in the suburbs, enjoying his life, is being
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.620]   chased by this crazy bird, right?
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.580]   So obviously I had to watch it again, and I said, "Oh, that was a crucial part that
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.580]   I fell asleep in."
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.740]   Another movie that I remember very distinctly was the movie Inception.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.180]   And everybody said, "Oh, it was such a great movie."
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.980]   Then I just remember every time they fell asleep, I fell asleep.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.580]   And then I woke up, it's like, "What is this?
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.700]   How many dreams does he have?"
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.460]   And then recently we said, "You know what?
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.780]   Let's watch it again because maybe it'll make more sense to me."
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.740]   And sure enough, I fell asleep.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.800]   So to this day, all I know is it's about dream.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.080]   Something happens in the dream, and then there's this little thing that they turn at the end,
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.200]   and then they die.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.420]   So I can't explain to you exactly what happened, but that's kind of what I remember.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.220]   So unless the movie is riveting, I usually have a hard time staying awake.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.300]   That's why I love AMC theaters because they have the recliner now.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.660]   So whenever I go watch a movie with them, usually I wake up with somebody angry because
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.780]   I snored in the middle of the movie.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.580]   Well I say all of this because the text that we're looking at in chapter 12, verse 18 through
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.300]   24, it presents to us two mountains, Mount Sinai and Mount Zion.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.420]   Mount Sinai is where the Israelites received God's commandment and the law.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.400]   So God comes and He speaks to Moses and He gives the law.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.340]   And so He's telling them, to these Jews, that you did not come to this mountain, but you
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.340]   came to Mount Zion.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.260]   And Mount Zion is representative of God's dwelling, God's place.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.420]   And so that's where they received the grace of God.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.340]   The understanding of Mount Sinai is crucial.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.420]   It is essential to understanding Mount Zion, what it is that He was trying to present for
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.140]   the past 11 chapters.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.400]   So because of the way that the gospel has been presented, because New Testament, to
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.440]   be honest, is easier to understand because it's straightforward.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440]   Who is God?
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.040]   Well God is love.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.320]   God is this.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320]   What is the gospel?
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   The gospel is this.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   What did Jesus do?
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.400]   He died on the cross, He shed His blood.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.520]   So it is very straightforward.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.020]   Old Testament is all a shadow.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.660]   Just like the shadow, it's not clear.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.120]   It points to something that is in reality.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.640]   But the shadow is the preparation so that when the reality comes, that the reality would
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.200]   make better sense.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.720]   But what happens is when you skip the Old Testament and you come just to the New Testament,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.020]   there's so many things that really don't make a lot of sense.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.800]   But because you hear it over and over and over again, you don't question it.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.480]   So one of the fundamental questions about the cross, why did Jesus die?
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480]   We know the answer.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.000]   Because He loved us, He died for our sins.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.480]   But why did He die?
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.240]   Why couldn't He just forgive us?
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.720]   Because when we forgive people, we just forgive.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   Right?
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.360]   He shed His blood for our sins.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.660]   We don't shed blood for people.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.920]   Nobody practices that.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.400]   So we heard the gospel, and especially if you grew up in the church, without ever really
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.320]   digging, why did He have to die?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.080]   What was the shedding of blood?
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.840]   What was this drama of being crucified, dying and resurrected?
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.000]   What is the purpose of the church?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.520]   So we have this very superficial understanding because we fell asleep at the crucial part
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.260]   of the preparation.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.480]   And so our understanding of the gospel, if you ask me what the movie Up is about, it's
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.640]   about an old man, and he's lost his wife, and then some crazy bird.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.120]   But that doesn't really describe it.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.960]   I tell you, Inception, it's about some dream, and then they have another dream inside of
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.920]   the dream, and then they have many other dreams inside that dream.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.500]   That's about what I can tell you.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.780]   So it's probably not wrong, but it's not a good synopsis of the whole movie.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.660]   If you grew up in the Western church, the emphasis has been predominantly, I would say
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:27.540]   90-95% of your understanding of your faith strictly comes from the New Testament because
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.940]   it is easier to understand.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:35.700]   In fact, years ago, I was at a pastor's conference with about 3,500 pastors in the room, and
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.260]   one of the seminars was that we need to preach the Old Testament.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.700]   And he asked all the pastors, "How many of you are currently preaching out of the Old
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.220]   Testament?"
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.220]   And so he asked us to stand up, and I happened to be one of maybe six or seven people, and
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.220]   I was so proud.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.080]   That was me.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:02.860]   But I was also very surprised that out of 3,500 pastors who preach on a regular basis,
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.820]   there was only about five or six of us.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.580]   And so the point that he was trying to make is the same point that I'm trying to make
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.380]   this morning, that when we have a superficial understanding of Mount Sinai, you may be
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.380]   able to articulate Zion, His grace.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.900]   You may be able to articulate the gospel because you've heard it, you've memorized it, you
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:27.060]   sang it, but you don't understand the depth of what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:33.220]   So I actually intended to have this sermon in one sermon about explaining the Mount Sinai
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.860]   and then talking about Mount Zion.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.320]   But I felt like I'm not going to do it justice if I just skim through Mount Sinai.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.980]   So I wanted to make sure that we studied this and what he's referring to, and then we'll
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.820]   get to what, when he says, "We didn't come to Sinai, we came to Zion," so that we'd have
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.740]   a better appreciation of what we talk about next week.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.020]   So let's look at it.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.020]   Mount Sinai.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.460]   He said, "You did not come to the first chapter 12, verse 18 to 21, for you have not come
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.940]   to the mountain that can be touched and to the blazing fire and to the darkness and the
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.500]   gloom and whirlwind."
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.820]   Let me just stop right here.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.540]   He's referring to God coming to give the law.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:22.220]   And the way that he describes it is blazing fire, darkness, gloom, and whirlwind.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.940]   Again, if you grew up in the Western church, when we think about the presence of God, when
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.780]   Jesus comes, I'm going to walk to him, I'm going to sit on his lap, depending on how
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.460]   old you are, hold his hand, and so we have this lovey-dovey feeling of the presence of
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.220]   God.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.540]   The Old Testament Jew did not have that same view.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:48.580]   Their starting point at Mount Sinai was terror, gloom, and whirlwind, and to the blast of
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.500]   the trumpet and the sound of words which sound was such that those who heard begged that
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.380]   no further word be spoken to them.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:03.260]   Think about how often we talk about how God spoke to us or we want God to speak to us.
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:09.380]   The Jews, when they heard God's voice, begged that God would stop speaking because they
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:15.380]   were so terrified of his presence that even when he spoke, they said, "We can't handle
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.380]   this.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.580]   Please ask God to stop talking to us directly.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.820]   Speak through our mediator Moses."
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.060]   Verse 20, "For they could not bear the command, 'If even a beast touches the mountain, it
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.820]   will be stoned.'
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.140]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, 'I am full of fear and trembling.'"
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.940]   Now prior to this event, it's not like the Israelites had no relationship with God.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.780]   They knew about God from a distance.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.140]   They heard about God.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:47.020]   They've seen his mighty works, but this is the first instance where God from heaven is
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.580]   physically coming and making his physical presence known in the nation of Israel at
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:59.380]   Sinai to give the law at the inauguration of Israel as a nation.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.900]   And in his presentation, it is not a party.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.620]   It's not a light event.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:11.820]   As soon as he shows up, there is fear and terror, fire, darkness, gloom, whirlwind.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:17.460]   In fact, if you can show the picture that comes up, if you can darken it, I want you
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.980]   to see the outline of the mountain.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.980]   Okay?
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:27.460]   Our projector isn't that sharp, but if you can see, I want this picture because this
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.740]   is what's being described for us in Hebrews, and I'm going to jump to the Old Testament
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.360]   to show you what the author of Hebrews is referring to.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.500]   And so I want that image because that's the image that's embedded in Israel's history.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.580]   Okay.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.260]   So remember that.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.620]   So remember that picture.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.700]   This is God physically presenting himself to the nation of Israel.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.980]   So if you can turn the lights back on, he's referring to what's taking place in Exodus
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.980]   and Deuteronomy.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.600]   Exodus chapter 19, 16 to 18, it says this.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.940]   So it came about on the third day when it was morning.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.660]   If you looked at that picture, you would naturally think that maybe it's dark because it's at
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.660]   nighttime.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.660]   He said, no, it's morning.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:12.260]   Only reason why it's dark is because he said God's presence came.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.260]   And that's not a made up picture.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.220]   That's an accurate picture because the Bible describes darkness fell.
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:23.260]   In fact, remember when we had Dr. Harris here, the darkness and the glory, he describes at
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.980]   the third hour when God wanted to inaugurate his new covenant, remember what happened?
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.420]   Darkness fell on earth.
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:37.260]   And he was veiling his glory because sinful man cannot be in the presence of this holy
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.260]   God.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.820]   And that's how the covenant, the first covenant of the law, when it was given, darkness and
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.620]   terror falls upon them in the morning.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.820]   That there were thunder and lightning, flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:59.140]   very loud trumpet sound so that all the people were in the camp trembled.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.180]   There wasn't this celebration, God is drawing near to us, let's all gather together to go
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.180]   watch.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.180]   That was not what happened.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:14.500]   As soon as they saw God's glory coming upon Mount Sinai, terror falls upon them.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.900]   They were afraid that they're going to die because of this presence, verse 17, and Moses
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:23.100]   brought the people out of the camp to meet God and they stood at a foot of the mountain.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.300]   Now Mount Sinai was all the smoke because the Lord descended upon it in fire and the
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.940]   smoke descended like the smoke of the furnace and the whole mountain quaked violently.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.180]   I want you to look at the next pictures that I have up here.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.660]   This is an actual picture of the way they believe that it's Mount Sinai.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.980]   It's in Arabia in some place.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.460]   So I don't have time to go over the details but there's plenty of documentaries or you
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:56.100]   can go on Google and look this up, YouTube and look at videos because it's well documented
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.480]   that they believe and it's very convincing that this is the mountain that is being referred
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.740]   to Mount Sinai.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.740]   If you look at it, it looks like there's two mountains.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.380]   You have the one in the front and one in the back.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.660]   Actuality it's the same mountain.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.180]   It's just that at some point the color changes.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.220]   The top of the mountain is black and then at some point in the middle it's light.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.220]   So it's the same mountain.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:26.220]   Let me show you the satellite picture of that mountain.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:32.340]   So because secular archaeologists are also intrigued why that would be there up on that
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.700]   mountain because they don't see any other mountain, any of that because it's a complete
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.060]   desert area.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:42.900]   So their explanation is at one point there must have been a volcanic eruption that caused
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.020]   that mountain, just the top part of it, to be black.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.940]   Well since then they've gone up to test these rocks and if you can turn to the next one,
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.600]   this picture you probably can't see too well but you'll see that the top of it is dark
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.820]   and then right next to it it's more light.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.460]   And so they were able to study the rocks and they broke it up and found out that it's not
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.180]   volcanic ash at all because if it's volcanic it should be dark all the way through.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.700]   It's only dark on the surface.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.380]   Meaning that the only logical explanation is something external burned these rocks and
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.700]   it stayed.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.060]   So I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.980]   If you can turn the lights back on.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.740]   Now that's not directly connected to what I'm about to say but it is intriguing that
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.060]   we have physical evidence of all that is mentioned here.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.040]   And along with that if you watch the documentary they'll tell you that at the bottom of Mount
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:41.780]   Sinai God made borders and so that they could not come up the mountain and at that archaeological
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.740]   site they found piles and piles of rocks all around to make borders so they couldn't come
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.740]   through.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.580]   And it is at that mountain when Moses comes up and he comes down, Aaron and the Israelites
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.300]   made an altar to the golden calf.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.700]   They found an altar at the bottom of this mountain with an altar with images of golden
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.540]   calf on it.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.220]   And that's also the mountain where Elijah goes and hides in the cave and they found
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.220]   that cave.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.220]   So it's very interesting.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:14.660]   So there's more than enough evidence to show that this is the mountain that the Bible is
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:21.420]   referring to and the fact that God's glory shone up up there with blazing fire and that
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.660]   it burned up the mountain and that it still remains there shows you how intense this scene
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.660]   was.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:35.540]   Exodus chapter 19, 12-13 says, "You shall set bounds for the people all around saying,
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.460]   beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border."
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.580]   Remember the border that I referred to.
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.980]   "Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.700]   No hand shall touch him but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether beast or
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.300]   man he shall not live."
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.980]   His presence did not invite people to come.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:03.520]   They were so terrified and God actually tells them, "If you come to me, you will die.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.340]   You or any other beast."
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.020]   Mount Sinai was not a welcoming site.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.180]   It caused them to fall in terror.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:17.100]   Exodus chapter 19, 22 says, "When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.780]   spoke and God answered him with a thunder.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.820]   The Lord came down on Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain and the Lord called Moses
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.660]   to the top of the mountain and Moses went up.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.940]   Then the Lord spoke to Moses, 'Go down, warn the people so that they do not break through
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.060]   to the Lord's gates and many of them perish.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.140]   Also let the priests who come near to the Lord consecrate themselves or else the Lord
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.780]   will break out against them."
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:43.500]   To break out means to have disease or even death sentence.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.940]   So the priests preparing and consecrating themselves, nobody drew near to God casually
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.500]   because it meant death.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.420]   Again in Exodus chapter 20, 18-19, "All the people perceived the thunder and lightning
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.540]   flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it,
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.500]   they trembled and stood at a distance."
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.420]   They didn't run to it, they stood at a distance.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.380]   Then they said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen but let not God speak to
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.980]   us or we will die."
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.140]   If you remember the scene when Moses is up in the mountain as God is commanding him to
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.420]   lead the nation of Israel, he says, "Let me see your glory."
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.660]   And God says, "If I show you my full glory, you will die.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.620]   But because you have asked," he says, "I'm going to cover you and I'm going to pass by."
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:39.980]   So you're going to see a glimpse of my glory, partial glory as I pass by, not my full glory.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:45.780]   But that glory, that reflection of that glory of God as he is protected, as he's passing
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:51.100]   by was reflecting on the face of Moses and when he came down and started to speak to
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:57.820]   the nation of Israel, they were terrified just by the reflection of that glory on Moses'
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.820]   face.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.860]   So they beg him, "Go into the tent.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.980]   Speak to us through the tent.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.100]   Put a veil on you."
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.940]   Because they were terrified of his presence and his very voice.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:16.220]   Again in Deuteronomy chapter 5, 24 through 27, you said, "Behold, the Lord our God has
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.780]   shown us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice from the midst of the
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.780]   fire.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.740]   We have seen today that God speaks with man, yet he lives," referring to Moses.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.220]   Now why should we die for this great fire will consume us?
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.860]   You see how talking about God's fire, they didn't automatically think like, "Oh, if we
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.860]   go there, we're going to live."
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.340]   They said, "If we go to God, we're going to die."
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.700]   That's what the Jews saw.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.900]   That's what they were thinking.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.020]   If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, then we will die.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.460]   If we keep hearing from God, we're going to die.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.020]   Think about that from the new covenant perspective in Western Christianity, how the gospel is
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.700]   introduced to us.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.580]   God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:11.260]   Whenever we hear anything harsh, we automatically, "This doesn't fit the gospel that I know."
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.700]   Whenever there's a warning about God's holiness, it's like, "It doesn't fit the gospel that
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.380]   I know, but it's the gospel of the Bible."
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:24.940]   Because the starting point in the Western church doesn't allow the judgment of God.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.620]   And yet, Mount Sinai, it is clear.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.980]   It is clear in the scripture because this is the way God presented himself.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.460]   Verse 26, "For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.760]   from the midst of the fire as we have and lived?
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.700]   Go near and hear all that the Lord our God says, then speak to us all that the Lord our
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:50.180]   God speaks to you, and we will hear it and do it."
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:56.680]   When I was in college, I was a Bible major, so I spent four years in undergrad studying
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   the Bible.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.580]   Then after I graduated, I went to seminary and spent a couple more years studying the
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.580]   Bible.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.720]   So, minimum of six years I was studying the Bible.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.100]   So when I came out, obviously I thought I have a good grasp of the Bible, learned systematic
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:15.500]   theology, how to do exegesis, went through the different parts of scripture.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:21.520]   But it wasn't until I started preaching through the Bible I realized how superficial my understanding
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.660]   of the gospel was.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.480]   I started, first of all, and the reason why I started preaching through the Bible wasn't
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.260]   because of an example that I saw or somebody told me that that's the way to preach.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.660]   I just ran out of material.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.540]   You know, after preaching three, four years topically, every week the greatest struggle
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.360]   was what am I going to say about discipleship this week?
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.020]   What am I going to say about, you know, lordship?
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.020]   What am I going to say about prayer?
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.020]   What am I going to say about word?
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.180]   So after about three years of preaching with the same group, you know, either I have to
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.580]   move church because I ran out of material, you know, or I'm going to have to repeat these
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.940]   same sermons over and over again.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.060]   And then I remember Chuck Smith, you know, I was listening to a seminar and they said,
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.060]   we're just going to preach the Bible.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.820]   You know, we're just going to open up the Bible in 1 Timothy.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.300]   And so I said, yeah, that sounds good.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.100]   So I remember very distinctly I started with the gospel of John.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.940]   After that I moved to Philippines.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.780]   And then I went to Galatians.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.580]   And then I started studying 1 and 2 John.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.060]   And then I went to study the book of Romans and then to Hebrews.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.580]   And eventually I made it through majority of the New Testament.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.420]   And then I started jumping through the Old Testament because I was running out in the
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.420]   New Testament.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.780]   And then I just started preaching through the Old Testament.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:37.460]   And it wasn't until about four or five years into the study, systematically, verse by verse,
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:43.380]   through book by book, and I began to realize my theology has completely started to change.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:50.620]   And the primary thing that was starting to really be highlighted, even after six years
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:58.620]   of Bible education at seminary, was God's nature of His holiness.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.580]   And I really felt like I got punched in the face, like, of course I knew God was holy.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.100]   If you take systematic theology, you talk about the attribute of God, holiness is always
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.340]   on the top.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.540]   So it wasn't that I wasn't taught.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.920]   It wasn't that I didn't hear sermons.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:19.460]   But to the degree that the Bible punches you in the face about this attribute and how every
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:25.060]   other attribute, everything that I know about the Bible and the gospel, stems from understanding
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.140]   Mount Sinai.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:32.460]   It stems from understanding the law, why the law was given, and proper view of who God
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.940]   is and in view of that, who I am.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.380]   Part of the reason why we wrestle, why we have so much problem in the Western church,
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.900]   and again, this is not unique to the Western church, but part of the reason why is because
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.380]   we're still at the center.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:56.700]   We view God as a supreme being who is so enamored with us that even though we won't articulate
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.220]   it that way, but He's our servant.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:06.740]   And so we receive Him and reject Him based upon what He does for me.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.220]   What has He done for me?
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.700]   And so we evaluate churches that way.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.620]   What does the church do for me?
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.380]   What does this small group have to do for me?
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.180]   What do these leadership have to do for me?
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.140]   Because we're still at the center.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.780]   Mount Sinai totally obliterates all of that.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.940]   Because the whole purpose of the law is to teach us that you are dead in your trespasses
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.340]   and so that you may see how utterly sinful you are.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.360]   That was the purpose of Mount Sinai.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.480]   And that's exactly how it is described.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.380]   So you remember Israel's history was God in heaven.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.000]   They were speaking to Him, all of a sudden He comes to Mount Sinai.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.380]   And this is the closest that the Israelites have ever seen Him physically.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.000]   They heard it from a distance.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.480]   They were told through the patriarchs.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.140]   But now they're seeing a physical picture and the first encounter with Him is absolute
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.700]   terror.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.960]   Absolute terror.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:11.140]   So imagine that that God that they saw at Mount Sinai, now at the end of Exodus say,
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.220]   I'm going to come near.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.660]   I told you, you can't even come to the bottom of the mountain.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.340]   But I'm going to come.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.260]   Set up the tabernacle.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.260]   Because I'm coming.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.780]   The tabernacle was not a community center.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:29.900]   So if the Israelites were afraid to even hear His voice, can you imagine what this did to
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.860]   the nation of Israel when God said, I'm going to come to that tabernacle.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:40.780]   If a God that I saw from a distance terrified me, and God set it up so that all 12 tribes
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.600]   were equal distance to this tabernacle.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:50.220]   And this tabernacle at the Holy of Holies was a concentrated presence of God that they
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:55.220]   saw from a distance where they didn't even want to hear from Him.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.040]   Imagine what that did to the nation of Israel.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.900]   That's why in 2 Corinthians 3, 7 and verse 9, Apostle Paul calls the ministry of Mount
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:09.940]   Sinai as ministry of death and ministry of condemnation.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:16.040]   I guarantee you, nobody casually came to the tabernacle.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.100]   Because the tabernacle reminded them of death.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.940]   Can you imagine how bloody this scene was?
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:30.020]   And if you've ever seen a physical, physical, you know, setup of a tabernacle, or just imagine
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.180]   how big, the tabernacle was not huge.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.620]   It was not a size of a city.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.140]   It was probably the size of maybe, maybe our building.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.060]   It was not huge.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:45.260]   And they had to constantly sacrifice day after day for every sin committed by over a million
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.220]   people.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.540]   So you can imagine how many animals were being slaughtered every day that they smelled the
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.540]   animals.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.660]   Every day they saw the blood flow.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.140]   And all of this reminded them, this is what you deserve.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.360]   You come here, this is what you deserve.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.220]   So the tabernacle was not a welcoming place.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.400]   And God deliberately showed this to mankind, to Israel.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.520]   And that's why the author of Hebrews is telling them, you can draw near because God's not
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.540]   calling you to Sinai.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.060]   Because if He calls you to Sinai, you will die.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:28.300]   You need to understand what Sinai is so that we can understand what Zion is.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:35.700]   There's a reason why it says in Proverbs 8.10, "Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.960]   In the Western world, if you grew up in the Western church and you've heard the gospels
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.460]   exclusively through the Western pulpit, you probably heard at some point, the fear is
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.320]   not referring to terror.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.380]   The fear he's referring to is talking about reverence and honor.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.440]   That's probably what you heard.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:00.140]   Because the terrified presence of God doesn't fit the gospel of the Western church.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.180]   Because He loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.720]   No matter what you do, He forgives you.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:11.240]   And so because we've exclusively heard the gospel that way, it doesn't fit our paradigm.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.780]   So the way that it is described is, he's not talking about being terrified in the presence
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.780]   of God.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.040]   He's talking about honor and reverence.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.600]   Well guess what?
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.280]   That's exactly what it means, to be terrified.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.240]   To be terrified of the presence of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.340]   Why is the fear of the Lord beginning of wisdom?
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.400]   Because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of our salvation.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.840]   Until you recognize who it is that we have offended, until you recognize who it is that
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:46.680]   you will meet outside of the blood of Christ, and there is no terror, then there's no
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.240]   need for the gospel.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:54.440]   The beginning of wisdom, the beginning of salvation is recognizing that the one that
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:59.180]   we have offended is that God of Mount Sinai.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:04.280]   They couldn't even hear His voice.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:10.460]   That's why He says in Matthew 10, 28, "Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:18.920]   to kill the soul, but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.720]   Does that sound like reverence to you?
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.960]   Does that sound like honor?
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.520]   That's what He said, "No, fear, honor Him who can kill you in hell."
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:31.260]   Does that sound like, no, that's terror.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:37.620]   Think about how often we make decisions and we compromise because we're afraid of what
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.680]   other people are going to think of us.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.120]   We're afraid of the consequence in this earth.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.480]   But He said if you're going to be terrified in anything, be terrified where you really
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.560]   should be terrified.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.920]   Not only is there a consequence physically, but there's consequence in eternity who can
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   send you to hell.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.680]   If you're going to be terrified, if any fear is going to guide you in your decision, if
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.960]   any fear is going to cause you to make certain decisions and live a certain way, make sure
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.720]   it's the fear of the Lord.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.640]   That's why Mount Sinai is essential in understanding Zion.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.560]   Without understanding, grace is just a free gift.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.480]   It's just like Halloween, they're giving you candy for free.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.840]   You did nothing.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.680]   That's why when Apostle Paul introduces the gospel in Romans chapter 1, he says, "The
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.280]   wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness."
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.080]   The wrath of God.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.760]   R.C. Sproul describes the word wrath in Greek as "orge" where we get the word "orgy"
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.160]   is unbridled passion.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.360]   No self-control.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.800]   That's where the word comes from.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:53.400]   And he describes the word wrath there as God without constraint, without mercy.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.600]   He is unleashing his anger towards sinners.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:05.920]   He says that in the end, all that we have seen about the wrath and the terror of God,
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:13.680]   all of that, all of that was tempered because he knew his son was coming.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.640]   But on the day of judgment, all of that will be behind.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:24.320]   And we have a tendency to think, again, the idea of hell doesn't fit Western Christianity.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.680]   So the way that hell is described is, hell is a place where God withdraws himself.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.520]   There's no presence of God at all.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.460]   So you're kind of like washing his hands, "Oh, God's not guilty of hell.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.560]   You deserve that you go there."
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.440]   But God kind of withdraws.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.320]   That's not how the Bible describes hell.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.440]   Hell is a place where the grace of God has been withdrawn.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:50.680]   It is the full display of his glory without constraint, without the covering of the blood
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.380]   of Christ.
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:57.040]   So heaven is a place where we see the full degree of his grace.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.020]   And hell is a place where we see the full degree of his glory in his wrath.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:09.640]   And both places is magnificent and terrifying because of God.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:15.080]   That's why John Newton says in his song, "Amazing Grace," "Twas grace that taught my heart to
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   fear."
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.760]   He's like, "Oh, because we're under grace, there's no fear in our hearts."
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.280]   He said, "No, it's the grace of God that caused me to fear."
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.560]   Because it's the fear of the Lord that is the beginning of salvation.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:34.040]   And it was grace my fears relieved.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   Charles Spurgeon in his autobiography has a whole chapter dedicated saying God's law
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   tormented him before he came to saving faith in Christ.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:50.920]   It was because he understood what it meant to be in the presence of God by the law that
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.680]   drove him to Christ.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.260]   Martin Luther, the whole Reformation, Protestantism, it's based upon this man.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:06.760]   And he describes his salvation as hating righteousness, recognizing that he could not appease God with
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:13.960]   the law, which caused him to see that that's what grace was.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.200]   Rob Bell wrote a book called "Erasing Hell."
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.380]   And it's because his idea of the gospel doesn't fit hell.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.400]   How can God be fair if he allows hell?
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   Why would God do that?
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.360]   Again, the reason why it doesn't fit him is because his very understanding of the gospel,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.120]   his very understanding of God himself, he fell asleep.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:42.240]   He doesn't realize the primary person that has been offended is not the world, is not
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.120]   Satan, it's God himself.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.640]   When we are in fear, who do we run to?
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.080]   When we're younger, we'll run to mom or dad because we assume that they can protect us.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.020]   So if you go to a playground and there's a bully, we run to mom and dad because mom and
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.800]   dad's bigger.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.720]   And so you feel safe.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.240]   When we grow up, you know, we're stronger than our parents at some point, and so we
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.020]   can't run to them, so we run to the police.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.080]   So they come with their guns.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.120]   Or maybe they're too far, so you'll buy a gun.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:18.000]   Whatever that may be, fear of something that may harm us, so when we are afraid, we go
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.640]   to something bigger and stronger to protect us.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.440]   But here's the dilemma of mankind.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:31.520]   What caused the greatest fear and greatest terror was God himself.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.880]   So who do you run to if God's the one that you're afraid of?
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:41.760]   Where do you run when you see God coming, knowing that that's where life is, but that's
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.280]   also where I'm going to be destroyed?
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.640]   Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.640]   Where do I run from?
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.960]   Where do I go to?
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:58.720]   If God's the one that causes the greatest terror.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.200]   We've heard the gospel through the Western channels where God has been presented because
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.800]   we're marketing the gospel to get as many people through the door, and the deception
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.600]   of Western Christianity is that so many people have come through the door not knowing who
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:18.280]   God is, and when God, when Jesus says, they will say, "Lord, Lord," and He says, "I
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   never knew you.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.360]   You didn't know me."
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.880]   That's how He was going to describe, "You did not know me."
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.120]   You regurgitated the gospel.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.360]   You said the right things, but you didn't know me because they did not understand Mount
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.760]   Sinai.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.640]   He's not unconditionally in love with rebellious sinners.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:44.320]   He is holy, wrathful, angry, and vengeful.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.040]   Yeah, vengeful.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   That's what it says.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.720]   You leave room for the vengeance of God.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:36:01.280]   So if your paradigm was created simply by the New Testament preaching of the gospel,
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.160]   and you jump through all the difficulty, "I don't want to know this wrathful God.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.080]   I don't want to know this scary God.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:14.600]   I want to get to the new God of the New Testament," you can easily miss what Christ has done on
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.680]   the cross.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:22.160]   That's why Isaiah 6, verse 5, this holy man, as he is being prepared to be sent out to
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.280]   represent God, it wasn't enough that he got the message correct.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.920]   He needed to know who God is.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   It's not enough that you study, then you can regurgitate and tell you, "I got this, and
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.280]   then I'm presenting it to you."
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.640]   A representative of God needs to properly understand God Himself.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.680]   That's why God doesn't just give him the words.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.680]   God reveals His glory.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:50.880]   As soon as he's in the presence of God, in Isaiah chapter 6, verse 5, he says, "Woe is
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   me.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.360]   Woe is me."
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.720]   You know what the word "woe" means?
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.160]   Literally it means, "I'm undone.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   I'm dead."
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.720]   That's what that means.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.520]   I'm dead.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.000]   I'm not going to survive this.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.840]   That's what that means.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.920]   And this is a man that God handpicked to represent Him, and His response in the presence of God
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.360]   is, "I am dead.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.400]   I'm a man of unclean lips from the people of unclean lips."
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   Meaning, he knew that he was being called to open his mouth to present God.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.440]   But how can I use this dirty mouth to present this?
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.680]   That's what he meant.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.400]   So fear and terror fell upon him.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.760]   And it's not just Isaiah.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:38.000]   In every instance, whether it was the disciples, John in the book of Revelations, elders at
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:45.120]   the throne of God, the angels, the holy creatures in the presence of this holy God, covering
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:50.600]   their eyes to veil themselves from His glory because they were terrified of His presence,
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:57.940]   were circling His throne saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty."
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:08.620]   Every instance that a human being, a sinner in the presence of this holy God, is terrified.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.380]   But that's what he means, that you did not come to Mount Sinai.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:19.680]   Because to a first century Jew, they didn't have to be taught to be terrified by God.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.700]   Their whole experience with God was terrifying.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:27.100]   There's a reason why they wouldn't pronounce His name.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.860]   And if you read the Old Testament, they changed His name Yahweh to Adonai because they were
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:37.500]   afraid that they were going to break one of His commandments to use His name in vain.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.540]   So he said, "Just in case."
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.980]   I don't know if that's what God meant, but just in case, we don't want to mess with the
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   law.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.500]   I remember Adab and Nebihu, God gave them specific instructions and they didn't follow
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:55.300]   strictly and because of that, the holy fire comes and consumes them and they die.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.540]   So imagine, so you know what, we're not going to get this wrong.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.060]   We're not even going to pronounce His name.
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:07.060]   So to this day, you know, you probably heard the name Jehovah, Yahweh.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.060]   You know why we have Yahweh and Jehovah?
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:16.980]   Because the Hebrew language doesn't have vowels and they didn't pronounce it for so many years.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.620]   We're guessing, is it Yahweh or is it Jehovah?
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.780]   I think more people lean toward Yahweh.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:27.520]   But that's the reason why we have Jehovah and Yahweh.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:34.380]   You didn't have to tell first century Jew, have reverence, be terrified, take this seriously.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.620]   In fact, they have to be told exactly the opposite.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.660]   God's not calling you to Hasanah, Sinai.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.340]   He's calling you to Zion.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.980]   We'll talk about that next week.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:53.340]   But remember the progression, the whole progression of the gospel is God from heaven coming to
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:58.620]   Mount Sinai and then that terrifying view of Sinai, God says, I'm going to come in the
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.220]   tabernacle, get ready.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.020]   So you better believe they took every command seriously.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.340]   Touching of the poles, presenting the measurements, where they're supposed to go, where they're
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.460]   not supposed to go, what sacrifices they're supposed to make, what sacrifices they're
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:18.340]   not supposed to make, and they bring a tainted animal and as a result of that they die.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.260]   And they break any commandment, they would die.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.740]   So it wasn't just, oh, we made a mistake, God forgives us.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:27.700]   He's like, no, if you did that, you came and touched the holy things when you're not supposed
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.860]   to touch it.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:35.740]   So I guarantee you people did not casually come into the tabernacle.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:40.140]   My guess is every time they needed to go to the tabernacle, they had probably had a meeting
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.380]   in their family.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.220]   And maybe they probably didn't take their children either because just in case any of
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:51.300]   the kids run into a place where they're not supposed to go and they die.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.900]   They probably prepared.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.700]   When we go there, here are the instructions.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.340]   We're supposed to wait outside.
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.340]   The priest is supposed to come.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.880]   He's supposed to lay his hands.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.820]   We only go in where they tell us.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.340]   We only speak when they tell us to speak.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.980]   When it's time to leave, we leave.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.420]   And when the priest say to come, we come.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.980]   When they tell to go, we go.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.980]   Everybody get that?
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:16.940]   The presence of the tabernacle was so terrifying.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:23.580]   My guess is that they took that very, very seriously.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:31.020]   That's why at that tabernacle, when they went to the temple, and from the temple, he sent
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.320]   this Holy Spirit in us.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:41.220]   And then that Spirit that is in us, that they were so terrified of, he says, now you are
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.420]   the temple of God.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.420]   And that's what Apostle Paul means in Corinthians chapter 3 and chapter 6.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.060]   You have a church who is divided, not taking sin seriously.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.980]   Worship is in chaos.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:01.080]   Do you not know that you are the temple of God and the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:07.580]   So when a Jew heard this, that terrifying scene, that terrifying God, that God that
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:15.180]   they were so afraid of in tabernacle, he's in you now, it would have created terror in
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:25.140]   them, realizing that they are the temple of God, individually and collectively.
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:31.460]   You see, somebody who does not understand this is not going to understand the weightiness
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.460]   of worship.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:39.700]   They say, worship is somewhere we come, we sing some songs, you know, and then it's how
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.580]   far is the church, you know.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:46.580]   We've made it so casual, make it easy as possible, and as a result of marketing the church, we
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.580]   have this weightiness of what it is that God has called us to do, and most people don't
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:56.460]   understand in our generation that we're approaching a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.260]   And the only reason why you and I are not consumed is because if you're a child of God,
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:04.300]   we are covered by the blood of Christ.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.940]   And the only one that could have saved us from that wrath of God, that terrifying scene
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:13.500]   of God, was His only begotten Son.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:18.580]   And it is that that covers it, that that He's referring to in Mount Zion.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:24.420]   People ask me, like, why do you keep wearing a suit?
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.580]   I have people tell me, it's like, this is California, hang loose, man.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.740]   You know, relax.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.420]   And I know, I know I look like a fuddy-duddy.
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.180]   You know, short and stocky people don't look good in anything.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.620]   I'm very aware of my physical presence.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.340]   I'm very aware.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.220]   It's not because of fashion.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.380]   In fact, I don't like it.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.780]   I like being comfortable.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:54.840]   I wear it because I recognize what it is that God has called me to do.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.020]   And it's really preparing my own heart.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.820]   That's why I don't give you my opinions.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.860]   And I'll tell you, if it's my opinion, I'll tell you it's my opinion.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.700]   Because this is not my pulpit.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:13.500]   I've been called to declare what the Bible says, even if it offends you, even if you
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.340]   hate me for it.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.140]   Before I am your servant, I am His servant.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:24.660]   And so I want to make sure that what I do physically, mentally, and spiritually reflects
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.300]   what God has called me to do.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.660]   It really is not much different for you.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.580]   That calling is not just for me.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:39.860]   As a church called to the presence of God, we don't have dress codes at our church.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.580]   Because I don't think saying you have to wear this and you've got to do this, that doesn't
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.460]   make it reverent.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:53.580]   But I encourage you to examine when we come to church, do we recognize the God that we
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.060]   came to worship?
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:59.860]   Are we coming to church because it's just a gathering for me?
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:00.860]   What am I going to get?
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.460]   Is the sermon going to be good for me?
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:07.380]   How much of our attitude reflects the God, the almighty, holy, holy God that we have
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:13.460]   come to honor and thank for covering us with the blood of Christ?
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:18.180]   Somebody who doesn't understand Mount Sinai takes his own sin lightly.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.660]   One saved, always saved.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.860]   Our whole doctrine is based upon a cliche, a bumper sticker.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.660]   Christians are not perfect but forgiven.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.300]   So our whole understanding of salvation is by a bumper sticker or for cliches or little
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:37.260]   things or blogs that we've heard.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:42.220]   Man or woman who doesn't understand who God is takes his sin lightly.
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.020]   Takes the word of God lightly.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:50.140]   Because not recognizing that this is his very breath that we are handling.
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.940]   Do not to pervert it to say whatever.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.100]   Add to it or take away from it.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.180]   Do not turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:03.700]   And a man or woman who does not understand who God is takes the church lightly.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.820]   Church becomes a place where it serves me.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:06.820]   What does it do for me?
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:07.860]   We're at the center.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.500]   We don't actually, we never say this out loud but that's our, everything is evaluated based
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.860]   upon what does it do for me?
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.140]   Not realizing this is the temple of God.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.020]   I guarantee you nobody walked into the tabernacle saying, "The priest, they're not reaching
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.620]   out to me."
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:29.380]   I guarantee you nobody walked into the tabernacle thinking, "Oh, the altar is too far."
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:34.220]   They came in making sure that they followed the rule that they don't offend this holy
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.420]   God.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:44.280]   The church is the temple where God dwells collectively in us.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:51.180]   Is our casual nature toward church and worship a reflection of a wrong view of God?
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:47:00.500]   Do we take the collective coming in the presence of God as if it's convenient, is it inconvenient?
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.700]   Does it actually reflect who God is?
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:08.040]   First Peter chapter 3, 18, it says, "For Christ also died for sins once for all.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:12.120]   The just for the unjust."
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   Think about that.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.420]   With all the yelling and screaming and marching and rioting about wanting justice but the
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:26.780]   greatest injustice that the world has ever seen is Christ crucified.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:32.420]   Because the only innocent man who died, the only true innocent man who died, died for
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.360]   unjust sinners.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.600]   We come to celebrate injustice.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.400]   We are saved because of injustice.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.680]   We serve him.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:52.640]   We worship him because of the greatest injustice that has been carried out by God the Father
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.360]   so he can dwell among us.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.600]   Just for the unjust so that he might bring us to God.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:09.640]   Having been put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:13.360]   I want to end with a practical application.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.080]   There's reasons why we have, as you're walking through, I don't know how many of you guys
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.720]   noticed there's essential books.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.440]   We have three essential books that we ask all our members to read.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:27.560]   And the reason behind it, Holiness of God, R.C. Sproul.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:33.520]   Now I rarely recommend books because I'd rather have you be saturated with God's Word.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:39.020]   But we recommend this as fundamental in the church because Holiness of God changes the
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:44.640]   paradigm that Western Christianity has about who God is.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.160]   He's not a holy bellhop servant like we call him and then he comes running.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   He didn't answer my prayer.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.340]   Maybe God's not real because he doesn't serve us.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.440]   This changes that paradigm.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:59.560]   I think R.C. Sproul does the best job that I've read in helping us to change that paradigm.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:04.720]   So even if you read it, if you read it superficially or you didn't really digest it, I highly recommend
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.720]   not just to read it but digest this.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.060]   And any part of it that you don't understand, go back and read it and ask questions.
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.600]   So this is a must.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.640]   The second thing is the Gospel according to Jesus.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.840]   There are other books that you can read for this, but I think he does the best job on
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.840]   this.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.000]   Gospel according to Jesus, knowing who God is helps us to understand what the Gospel
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.240]   is and what the Gospel does.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.640]   It's not just like God just like, "Oh, you know what?
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.600]   I took sin very seriously, but since my son died, I don't care about sin anymore in the
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   New Testament."
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:41.280]   Again, that's Western Christianity.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.360]   I'm knocking on the Western Christianity, but this is true probably of everywhere else.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.720]   That's just where I am, so that's what I'm referring to.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:54.500]   But this helps us to understand what does salvation look like?
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:59.300]   What does a sinner who's been covered by the blood of Christ having a personal relationship
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.880]   with this holy God look like?
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.240]   That's what this book helps us to understand.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:09.120]   He just goes through passage after passage, parable after parable to help us to understand,
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.440]   not as superficial as, "Oh, God loves you.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.440]   I had a wonderful plan for you."
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.800]   Like, "Forgive it!"
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.920]   He goes detail.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.200]   So again, this is why this is essential.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.680]   So if you don't understand this or maybe disagree with this, you're probably going to have a
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.480]   lot of problems with the way that I preach.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.920]   You're going to have a lot of problems with the way that we present the Bible because
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.360]   you either don't understand this or you don't agree with it.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.320]   So this will help you at least understand why the preaching and teaching is a certain
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.200]   way at our church because we believe this to be true.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.000]   And the third one is also from MacArthur.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.080]   There are other books that you can read on this, but we think he does the most thorough
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:50.440]   job on what the biblical church looks like because if the church is a temple of God,
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.300]   we're going to want to know that he didn't just say, "Gather together and just figure
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.440]   it out and then reach the lost and try to figure out how to do it."
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.400]   He didn't do that.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:03.880]   Imagine a God who gave so much intricate details how the tabernacle and temple was to be built
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.960]   did not build a New Testament church and say, "You just figure it out."
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.960]   It's inconsistent with the God that we know, the Old Testament, and God didn't do that.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:17.320]   He gave us intricate details of what we ought to follow, what the church should look like,
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.960]   standards of an elder, how to discipline when people are in sin.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.160]   And so all of these things are described in the New Testament that we just kind of give
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.360]   broad strokes.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.720]   And so if we're going to approach this holy God, even though we're covered by the blood
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:33.920]   of Christ, we need to properly understand what the Bible teaches about the church.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.360]   What does he desire?
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.840]   Because this is the body of Christ.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.560]   So if we're going to build a church that honors God, we have to figure out how to honor God
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.600]   the way he tells us to honor God.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.280]   And I think he does the best job in doing this.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:52.560]   So this is probably one of the more drier versions because if you're looking for a novel
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:58.800]   to fall asleep, you know, like to revive you, you're going to require to be committed to
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.200]   this and try to understand, wrestle with this.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   And again, the reason why we practice church membership, the reason why we're so slow in
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.280]   establishing leadership in our church, and why we have certain things that we do, it
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.420]   all helps you to understand it from this book.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:19.640]   So these are the three essential books that we encourage you to read because it will help
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.080]   you to understand your faith, but it also helps you to understand what we're trying
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.980]   to do at church.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:31.720]   And all of this so that we do not turn from his word to the left or to the right, that
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:36.560]   we don't view God based upon the prejudices that we've gained.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.280]   That's fair, not fair.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:48.640]   So much of Christianity is evaluated, received, and rejected based upon what we think is fair.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.760]   When we do that, we place ourselves above God.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:53:01.280]   If God is truly king, even if every part of us says it's unfair, I trust God over my own
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.600]   judgment, right?
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   All of this is so that we can understand Zion better because we did not come to Zion with
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.440]   Sinai.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.040]   God is not calling us to Sinai.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:20.000]   Sinai was to better help us to understand what it is that we have in Christ, and we'll
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.800]   get to that next week.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:29.600]   Let's pray.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.040]   Let's take a few minutes as, again, our worship team comes to allow the word of God to dwell
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:42.520]   in us richly, to not to superficially follow Christ from a distance, that the Christ and
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:47.760]   the gospel that we profess isn't something that I've chosen to accept because it makes
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:55.440]   more sense to me, but the God that I worship is the God of the Bible.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.960]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leaves us.
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
