[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   We're going to bring our attention up to the front and take about 30 minutes to walk
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.080]   through the passage.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.120]   Let's take a moment to pray for God's blessing and spiritual fruit as we walk through the
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.120]   verses.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.120]   Let's pray.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.920]   All right, God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.760]   Lord, we're such a privileged people to be able to come to your word and to see the light,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.000]   to have your spirit illumine our eyes, to open up the text to us, and God, to have it
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   so freely.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.240]   We just absolutely recognize that we are so privileged, and God, we want to express to
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.720]   you that we're so thankful.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.960]   Father, Lord, we do confess, although the scripture and the word is so near us, so readily
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.760]   available, Father God, sometimes the standard of your word is so high, and also our flesh
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.360]   is so weak, and we pray that you grant to us spiritual strength.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.120]   We pray, Father God, that you would empower us so that our hearts and our minds would
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.720]   be receptive, and God, that we would continue to labor and to fight every source of distraction,
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.520]   rebellion, resistance in our heart, whatever it may be, Lord, excuses, to put those things
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   aside, and God, that we would continue to aspire to conform to what we see in the word.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.320]   And so thank you again for what you teach us in the book of Philippians.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.600]   We pray for a fruitful time of study tonight.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   It's in Christ that we pray.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   Amen.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.080]   Okay, so what I'd like to do is first just take a moment to walk down this passage together
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.880]   and kind of show you why I outlined in a brief way, by just simple indentation, this passage
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.840]   the way I did.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.680]   So obviously, in this beginning portion, it clearly kind of started off a new section
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.560]   by Apostle Paul saying, "Now I want you to know."
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.440]   So now listen up, right?
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.400]   And typically he gives us a topic sentence this way, and he says, "Now I want you to
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.480]   know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.400]   gospel so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known to the whole
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.760]   Praetorian guard and to everyone else, and that most of the brethren, trusting in the
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.520]   Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.200]   fear."
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.960]   At that point, what you see is, if this is the topic sentence, here you have, "In terms
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.280]   of the circumstance having turned for the greater progress of the gospel," you have
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.800]   two "so that's" here, "and that and so that," which tells me this one sentence is like one
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.080]   complete thought.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.440]   So what I did is I broke it off for you guys right there.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.680]   I'm going to read on.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.200]   It says, "Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.240]   are also from goodwill.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.720]   The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.080]   The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   to cause me distress in my imprisonment."
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.240]   As I read this, I kind of thought, "Hmm, that's completely a kind of a transition of thought
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.840]   there," because over here it was, "This is great.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.200]   There's progress of the gospel, and most of the brethren are actually trusting in the
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.600]   Lord and being encouraged in faith," and one might say, "Wow, that's really awesome."
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.960]   And Apostle Paul has a little bit of a contrast and says, "But some, to be sure, are not actually
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.280]   being encouraged that way.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.440]   Some, to be sure, are actually responding in their flesh a bit."
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.400]   So then you start thinking, "Okay, that's kind of horrible."
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.800]   And so I break a break right there, because he asked this question, "What then?"
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.960]   And so there's a transition of thought.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.440]   Here is something good.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.080]   Here is something bad.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.080]   What then?
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   Right?
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.320]   And as he asked this question, you got to give attention to these kind of rhetorical
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.480]   questions because you know Apostle Paul wants us to think about it.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.700]   What are we to do then?
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.720]   If in this kind of dire situation, Apostle Paul is in prison, and the people who are
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.200]   taking this opportunity to boast in their own teaching perhaps, maybe have a kind of
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.240]   selfish worldly ambition to succeed while the head honcho is locked up in jail or wherever
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.520]   it may be, what do you do?
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.960]   And he says, "What then?
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.280]   Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.760]   And in this I rejoice.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.520]   Yes, I will rejoice.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.480]   For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.280]   of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.160]   not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now, as
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.960]   always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death."
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.120]   Okay, so there's our paragraph, or at least section of the scriptures for tonight.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.480]   And I split it into three sections, not just because having three points to a sermon is
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.280]   awesome, but because you saw the flow of thought, right?
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.040]   You saw how he was saying, "I'm so grateful that there is a greater progress of the gospel."
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.400]   And then some, however, to be sure, are preaching to Christ out of envy.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.640]   "What then?" he said, "Only that in every way Christ is proclaimed, and that makes me
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.040]   happy."
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.960]   Three easy points.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.440]   So I have these three sections for you, verse 12 through 14.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.240]   There are circumstances for the progress of the gospel.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.360]   Clearly Apostle Paul is taking his current situation.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.720]   He's taking his current suffering.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.680]   He's taking the kind of situation that would cause any group of people or any particular
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.960]   individual to fret and worry, and he's interpreting it for them.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.600]   And then what's more, there is what I like to call a mixed bag reality, because Apostle
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.320]   Paul is very real, very truthful.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.160]   He sees it as it is.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.400]   There are surely some who are preaching out of envy.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.840]   And then verse 18 through 19, "However, I will rejoice when Christ is exalted."
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840]   Right?
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.160]   "I will rejoice when Christ is exalted."
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.760]   So in that way, I tried to summarize really briefly what I just read, and I hope that
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.920]   when you guys do your study, that you guys are walking through it multiple times in that
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.000]   way, reading it just a few times to find the flow of thought.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.280]   Where are the transitions of thoughts moving?
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.880]   And it helps you to really outline the passage.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   Okay.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.280]   Now what I like to do is start by looking at section one, verse 12 through 14.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.120]   Let's take a look at it a little bit more carefully.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.320]   I love it when Apostle Paul writes in such structural ways.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.320]   What do I mean by that?
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.640]   You know, we learn in school, when we start writing essays, paragraphs have structure
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   to it.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.280]   You have a topic sentence, you have certain points or arguments within it, and you also
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.900]   end with a conclusion, right?
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.120]   Something that's emphatic, or whatever it may be.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.320]   And what you realize is Apostle Paul's thoughts are typically really well organized.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.520]   So I love it when there's this kind of topic sentence.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.520]   Here he says, "I want you to know and understand this, brethren."
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.280]   So whenever you see that, you should also be thinking, "Anytime you ask the observations
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.920]   of the passage, where is the emphasis?"
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.780]   Clearly that's one emphatic thing, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.980]   progress of the gospel.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.840]   And then as you read the next part of that sentence, which is kind of a long sentence,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:57.440]   you realize all he's doing is unpacking that topic sentence by saying, "So that my imprisonment
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.680]   in the cause of Christ has become well known through the whole Praetorian Guard and to
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.280]   everyone else, and that most of the brethren trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.020]   have far more courage to speak of the word of God through fear."
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.560]   And so we ask the really kind of obvious question of, "Okay, so clearly Apostle Paul thinks
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.640]   this current circumstance is not as bad as you think it may be.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.120]   Yes, I am in jail.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.640]   Yes, I don't have freedom.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.480]   Yes, I have my limitations and all that kind of stuff.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.240]   I've been beaten.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.920]   But this circumstance has led to greater progress in the gospel.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   How?
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:41.520]   Simply because that imprisonment, A, has been well known through not only within his immediate
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.360]   context but all around.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.800]   So let's talk about that a little bit.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.200]   When you looked at this passage, we asked the question of, "Okay, how is it that his
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.800]   imprisonment being well known is a good thing?"
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.120]   We should be asking those questions, right?
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.360]   How is it that it's spreading to the guards is a good thing?
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.920]   Is it because then people are wowed at some of the miracles that has happened?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.560]   If you guys remember back in Acts chapter 16, there was even the earthquake shaking.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.360]   Here and now, we believe he's in Rome, and clearly there's him sharing the gospel, him
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.980]   even being on trial and trying to even convert those people who are trying him.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.200]   What is so great about this?
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.320]   What's really interesting is if you did one of those exercises that we were trying to
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:38.360]   do in previous Bible studies, there is something to notice here, which is that the imprisonment
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.320]   is specifically because of the cause of Christ.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.920]   Maybe you guys check the other translation, the ESV.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.720]   Who here is still using ESV as your own Bible?
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.320]   Just read it real fast just to see.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.600]   Okay, there's a lot of you guys.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.800]   So good.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.960]   When you look at this verse in the ESV, it reads a little different, right?
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   It does.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.440]   I'll read it for you, and it says this.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.240]   It says, "So that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.000]   that my imprisonment is for Christ."
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.680]   Do you hear that?
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.920]   It's kind of nuanced a little bit, and it kind of gives an emphasis on this idea.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.800]   This idea is the imprisonment is not just simply, "Oh, wow, Apostle Paul is suffering."
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.080]   Clearly he's suffered a lot.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:33.040]   He's been through all kinds of ... Remember like in 2 Corinthians 11 where he goes through
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.620]   this laundry list of sufferings he's experienced?
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.620]   It's not just that.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:45.200]   It's that all of those sufferings are now pointing very clearly to Christ.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.920]   Now what am I talking about here then?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.840]   The idea behind this is the greater progress of the gospel has come forth not just because
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:11:01.240]   word is spreading, but because of the clarity as to why he's there.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.880]   There is a clarity as to the link between what he's doing in jail, the suffering that
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.120]   he's experiencing, right?
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.320]   Because I want you to think about this.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:17.120]   A, sometimes I kind of forget, Apostle Paul even before becoming a Christian, like even
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.320]   before his conversion, he was already a well-known individual, an individual who was educated,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.120]   an individual who had authority.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.920]   I almost see him as like, if you actually study him or think about all the various character
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.520]   traits and all the various privileges he had, he was almost like a presidential candidate
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.120]   doing rallies, right?
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.940]   He's like being groomed to take charge.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.860]   He actually has authority to go and chase down people and even execute, right?
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.680]   So you think about this and you realize all I'm saying is he was already a well-known
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.160]   man, right?
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:57.480]   And in terms of being well-known, there is a sense to which he could have been well-known
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:04.240]   because man, Apostle Paul has courage to go stand up against King Agrippa to give a defense,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.480]   right?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.160]   He's a man who's experiencing miracles.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.960]   Around him, crazy stuff happens.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:17.480]   But the thing about it is, here, Apostle Paul is not emphasizing the fact that people heard
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.160]   of the miracles.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.140]   He's not emphasizing the fact that people heard just simply of his stature.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.360]   He's emphasizing the fact that people get why he's there, right?
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:36.040]   Now, there are times when sometimes I'm like, "Hmm, am I making too much of this?"
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:41.600]   Well, other passages really highlight the way Apostle Paul thinks about this.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.360]   For example, a passage in Ephesians chapter 3, you don't have to turn to it, but I'm just
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.720]   going to read it to you really briefly.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.640]   Verse 1 through 2 says, "For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus, for
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.780]   the sake of you Gentiles, if indeed you heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.920]   given to me," okay?
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.960]   What is he saying there?
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.140]   He's saying, "You know what my job is.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.640]   You know what my responsibilities are.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.920]   You know who I am."
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   Who am I?
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.240]   "Prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ," right?
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:22.520]   Now, the reason why I say this is because, quickly making a small point of just conviction
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.880]   for us.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   Right now, what I'm focusing on is this.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:36.900]   Is there a clear link between the things that we experience and its cause?
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.840]   Is there a clarity when people see you operate, when people see you work, when people see
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.740]   you carry the responsibilities that you have?
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.520]   Is it clear what you're living for?
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.820]   I'm assuming that a lot of people are looking at Apostle Paul thinking, "You know what?
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.760]   You had so much potential.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.240]   Why are you going through these beatings?
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.060]   These individuals are falsely accusing you.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.520]   These people are mocking you.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.600]   They're putting you through unfair trials, and they're realizing you could easily, very
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.000]   easily make it stop.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.640]   All you have to do is say, 'Oh, you know what?
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.640]   My bad.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.640]   I didn't want to make any trouble.'"
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.460]   That's it.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.800]   Back in the book of Acts, whether it was chapter 16, whether it's chapter 20, or chapter 28,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.400]   a lot of the people are just upset because they're like, "Hey, so many people are coming
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   to this guy, and this guy's going to be a threat to us.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.880]   All we have to say is, 'You know what?
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.760]   Just keep quiet a little bit.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   I'm done.'"
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   Right?
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.880]   There wouldn't be a problem.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.160]   But what was clear was Apostle Paul could not stop speaking of his Lord.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:47.960]   And so what you have is a clarity, a direct link as to what Apostle Paul is doing and
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.240]   why.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.600]   Okay.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.480]   And so in that way, the greater progress of the gospel is going forward.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.640]   And then what's more, he says, "And most of the brethren," so the majority of the people
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:06.000]   who are finding about a situation, concerned, all that kind of stuff, "they are trusting
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.400]   in the Lord because of my imprisonment and have far more courage to speak the word of
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   God."
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.600]   Okay.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.480]   So one thing we want to highlight is things that are repetitive.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.960]   What we'll see is that there's going to be an emphasis, and I'll do this kind of really
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.800]   briefly in orange too, there's going to be an emphasis on the progress of the gospel,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.280]   there's going to be an emphasis on speaking, there's going to be an emphasis on exaltation,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.720]   there's going to be an emphasis on proclamation.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.900]   Right?
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:42.640]   What Apostle Paul is most concerned about is the understanding that the advancement
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.480]   of the gospel and the truth about God needs to go forth.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.560]   Right?
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:55.040]   There is this one track, there is this high, high priority goal of Apostle Paul where what
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.840]   he desires to see in life is not simply that he would realize his full potential, it's
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.960]   not simply that he would escape certain woes, he wants to see the gospel preached.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.440]   And he says, "What I'm so encouraged about is not my two years of being neglected in
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:19.000]   jail, what I'm so encouraged about is that through this, the brothers, the people of
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.920]   God found courage to speak boldly."
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.000]   That's pretty cool.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.160]   What an amazing perspective for Apostle Paul to have.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.160]   Okay?
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.960]   Now, again, just taking a real brief moment, just a real brief moment to cause that to
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.720]   be a source of conviction for us.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:44.240]   If we were to think about this, man, number one, Apostle Paul is reinterpreting the current
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.760]   scenario.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.640]   Any single individual just wants to take a moment to imagine if some of our leaders at
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.040]   our church were imprisoned because of their stance, because of their beliefs.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   Right?
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.120]   I mean, there would be such a stir in our community.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   Right?
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.800]   Not only that, but I mean, think about how discouraged we would be.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.840]   Think about how discouraged we would be.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.240]   Think about how worried we would be.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.640]   Think about all the concerns of, "What's next for the church?
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   What's next for us?"
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   Right?
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.040]   Well, in this moment, Apostle Paul is reinterpreting that entire circumstance saying, "You guys,
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:23.280]   with all the worry and concern that's there, think about how the gospel is moving forward."
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:29.960]   And within that, there is a convicting, convicting truth there, which is there is a challenge
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:35.480]   to the normal kind of experience where in the moments where we're challenged to shine
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.840]   the light, in the moments when we're challenged to EV, are we going to have courage or are
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.840]   we going to cower?
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.520]   By way of just kind of thinking through this a little bit on my own too, for myself that
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.320]   is, I'm going to say honestly, every time I'm in front of an individual and I have that
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.400]   little stir in me, because I believe each one of us, we want to evangelize.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   Right?
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.760]   We want to share.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.640]   But within those moments, there are almost those times where I start playing out the
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   scenario in my head.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   Right?
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.800]   Okay, I'm going to say this, I'm going to say that, and I'm going to say there are a
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.600]   lot of times when I have a major case of the quit before I even begin.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.880]   I prejudge the scenario.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.560]   I just automatically assume, "Oh gosh, that person is not going to be receptive."
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.320]   I automatically assume like, "Oh gosh, this is not going to work."
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.320]   Right?
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.400]   Before I even say something, I already quit because why?
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.840]   In the end, I fear failure.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.140]   I fear it's not going to be effective.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.920]   I feel like they're not actually going to come turn around, whatever it may be.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.480]   And there's a huge case of fear there.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:48.040]   And so, as we look at that, there is a quick, quick just conviction for us when we think
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   about how is Apostle Paul's imprisonment, right, supposed to actually stir up courage
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.400]   as opposed to just worry and fear.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:03.160]   I believe if our hearts are right and we want to share the gospel, anytime we see individuals
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.800]   go like have a moment where they overcome those fears, overcome those sufferings so
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.760]   that they continue to pursue what they know and believe to be right before the Lord, what
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.680]   a huge, huge challenge that is for us.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:22.080]   Okay, so this first section, thinking about how Apostle Paul is thinking about the circumstances
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.200]   that are progressing for the gospel.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.320]   Okay.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.080]   Now, as we think about this, I want to move to the next section.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:36.200]   Someone can say, "Wow, like there's so many people who are then being encouraged.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.600]   This is great."
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.880]   But all I want to say is Apostle Paul in this next section, there is kind of a reality.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.280]   There's a realistic thing.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280]   Okay?
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.760]   Apostle Paul is not saying, "Hey, guys, I just want to say suffering is amazing, right?
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.760]   It's wonderful here.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.560]   Like here in the jail cell.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   It's awesome.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   The room is quaint.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   You got to try."
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.560]   Right?
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.360]   That's kind of like, I've heard sometimes like people kind of overcompensate.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.360]   Overcompensate meaning, yes, we're supposed to delight in all scenarios.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.040]   We're challenged, consider it all joy when we experience the variety of sufferings that
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.720]   we experience in life.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.960]   But we don't want to necessarily overdo that and be like, "Yes, bring it on."
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   Right?
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   Because that's kind of weird too.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.240]   We're not sadistic or like sadomasochistic where we love pain.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.480]   Apostle Paul is very real.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   He says, "You know what?
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:30.560]   To be sure," okay, which is a realistic look at the current situation, "there is a contrast."
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   And what he does is this.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.720]   I'm going to set up that contrast here.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.760]   There are some, but there are some.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.760]   Right?
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.360]   And what you have is like versus.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.240]   So whenever we have that, we should be thinking, "Do I really understand the contrast between
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.680]   the two people that we're thinking about?"
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.280]   Okay, as we take a look at this passage, let's think about the individuals that he says.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.080]   There are some who are preaching Christ even from envy and strife.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.200]   Some who are preaching Christ from goodwill, okay?
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.280]   The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:17.000]   However, the former, okay, the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.280]   from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:31.920]   Okay, so if we're thinking about kind of this versus here, we kind of think about this scenario
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.200]   and it says, "Man, they're experiencing everything from," I'm just going to put the first letters
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.320]   there, "envy and strife.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:45.400]   They've got selfish ambition, and then not only that, they're having this kind of thinking
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.480]   intentional thought of causing him distress."
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.600]   And as you think about that, it's kind of strange, right?
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.200]   Apostle Paul is in prison, already in like a dire situation.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.960]   Who in the world, who are these people?
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.400]   Some wicked people out there, right?
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.240]   Wicked people who are thinking about then just elevating themselves.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.540]   They're opportunistic, a little bit like sharks.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.560]   Who are these people?
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.120]   But as I kind of started thinking about that and asking those questions, like who are these
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.920]   individuals?
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.920]   There is this question, have there already been through church history where people take
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.300]   opportunities to one-up each other?
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.600]   Do people ever do ministry?
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   Like God forbid, but are there pastors who are self-motivated, who are seeking to preach
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.760]   just so that they can showcase their knowledge, to showcase how better they are, how eloquent
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   they are?
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.680]   They want to kind of step up in the ladder of the corporate ladder of church.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.440]   Those things kind of exist.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.600]   Is there ever rivalry within the church?
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.360]   Yes, there is.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.160]   Is there ever any kind of competition?
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.280]   It's like, "Oh, you think you're the anointed messenger?"
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.560]   Those kind of stuff happened even from a long time ago, back in the Old Testament, right?
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.480]   You think about even Moses and his own sister.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.040]   Does God speak to you alone?
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.080]   I want us to think about that because even within the very early stages of the church,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.720]   you guys think back to Acts chapter 5, people were trying to give generously from their
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   heart.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.560]   And then you have individuals jump into that saying, "Well, I'm going to one-up you.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.560]   I'm going to sell my house.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   I'm going to give everything."
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.560]   Why would you do that?
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.640]   It doesn't even make sense.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:46.080]   But it's so crazy how subtly our flesh, the motivation to just have some kind of influence,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:54.760]   the itch to have people respect you, for people to believe you're holier, like it's so strong.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.840]   And so just as a moment of conviction for us, what's really interesting as Apostle Paul
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.720]   says, even within moments like this, you have both.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   You have a mixed bag.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.920]   The reality is a lot of times there's a mixture of the flesh even within ministry.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.960]   And that's something we have to be really careful of, right?
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:20.680]   So Apostle Paul, with a dose of reality, says, "Individuals, some of them, some of them,
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.920]   not all of them, perhaps a minority, are even going to this degree."
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.560]   Now, what's really interesting is he has this contrast and he says, "These individuals,
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:38.640]   there's goodwill, there's love, and what I'm going to say is there's even respect."
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.000]   Apostle Paul clearly is somebody who is anointed for the defense of the gospel.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.140]   The early church recognized that Paul had apostolic authority.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:54.000]   And that's why when he was going from church to church preaching, people received him and
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.320]   said, "He is teaching to us the Word of God."
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.560]   Individuals who had the spirit of them, Christians who are being genuinely converted, they recognized
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.520]   that and so they gave him that kind of respect and ear, right?
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.280]   What's really crazy to me is the degree of the other side then.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.440]   It just highlights.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:20.080]   I think Apostle Paul is clearly highlighting, like, these individuals would go to the degree
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.800]   to cause an apostle this kind of distress.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.040]   These individuals who are preaching the gospel, going and actually trying to share of Jesus,
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.400]   there's such a mixture and such a blindness in them, they would actually go against an
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.440]   apostle.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:43.040]   So as a kind of a summary point of that, sometimes there's a mixed bag.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.360]   And I think as a convicting point, man, every single individual who is trying to do anything
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.440]   for the Lord, don't we have to?
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.360]   Don't we have to do diligence to examine our hearts to see, "Why in the world am I doing
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   this?"
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   Right?
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:06.320]   "Do I care much whether this like ministry or even just serving, do I care much about
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.400]   its success because it reflects me or do I care much about its success because it reflects
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.720]   God?"
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.280]   Right?
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.000]   Whatever I'm doing, what am I caring about in its end fruit?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.560]   Whatever I'm doing, what am I caring about in terms of the intentionality when other
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.080]   people see and what other people criticize?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.680]   Am I caring much about, "No, I just want this to be good because it benefits, number
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.360]   one, our God who is watching and he is worshiped because we're putting the energy and sacrifice,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.840]   and two, it's benefiting the church because it's going to benefit you in your edification
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.680]   of faith."
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.320]   Or are we caring deeply about, "Is this my work?
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:54.200]   How does this reflect my energy, my expertise and success in making sure that it's fruitful?"
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.640]   Those are just some of the things that we have to do.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   Okay.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.080]   So, as we think through that, I'm not going to...
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   On your...
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   Sorry, I forgot to mention.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:07.120]   On your papers, I listed a bunch of sample questions for questions about the passage
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.640]   so you can dive deeper and deeper.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.520]   I'm not going to cover all of them, obviously, just for the sake of time, but I just wanted
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.600]   to make sure that within each major section, we ask the more important ones, "Do we understand
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.560]   this contrast that people are saying?"
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   Okay?
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.560]   All right.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.440]   So, okay.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.520]   Within this, I want us to take a moment to just drop down into the context of this passage
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.160]   and think about this a little bit.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.680]   Apostle Paul said, "Look, guys, here's a scenario.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.480]   I know it's a little bit discouraging."
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.520]   Maybe a little bit is kind of understating that, right?
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.200]   I know it might be really discouraging, actually.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.760]   But let me reinterpret that for you.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.280]   This has caused there to be a greater advancing of the gospel, and for that, I'm really thankful
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.320]   because people are now knowing and the Christians are actually being encouraged and they're
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.060]   speaking with boldness.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:03.040]   The reality is that's the majority, but there are still some who are taking this opportunity
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.120]   for their flesh.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.840]   Now again, I'm assuming if we were to ask the question, "Why does Apostle Paul even
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.600]   care to address this?
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.480]   Could it be because the church is looking at this with a sense of discouragement?"
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.160]   I believe so.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.080]   And then as I thought about this, I want you to take a moment to think about if this was
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.320]   a real case scenario.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.880]   So I want to share with you that Pastor Peter Kim, he's mentioned many times to me that
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.440]   he regularly thinks about missions and evangelism because that's where his heart is.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.560]   And then once in a while, we'll go out to lunch or something, and then he'll just drop
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.200]   a bomb and be like, "What would you say if I went to X country to do missions?"
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   And I'm like, "What?
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.200]   What?"
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.920]   "So what would you think if I went to Korea?"
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   Or something like that, right?
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.080]   And I was like, "Dude," and then my mind's just running wild.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.680]   And then I'm going to just be honest, like sometimes I'll say something crazy like, "This
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.320]   church will never survive without you," right?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   Something like that.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.280]   Or there are moments I think about even bigger churches where the pastor has been there forever,
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   right?
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.600]   And you know, Grace Community Church with 7,000 members with Pastor John MacArthur,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.760]   I sometimes watch his sermons on video, and then there are days when I'm thinking like,
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.960]   "He's probably going to retire soon, right?
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.320]   He's looking extra pale today in this video," right?
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.500]   And I'm just sitting there thinking like, "Dude, the guy is like 71, 72."
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.840]   But I wonder like, "Dang, can you imagine?
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.080]   His father was pastoring the church.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.280]   He started passing the church at like 35."
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.440]   That's like years and generations of just people he's pastored.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:43.040]   And then to imagine like, if you can imagine having somebody that pivotal to a community
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.960]   be gone, be in jail, and the prospect of death is like really, really likely because he's
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.300]   already been beaten this close to death, right?
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.400]   And then in his absence, you start seeing like a rise of these pastors and shepherds
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.040]   where like, "That guy is pretty ungodly," right?
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.960]   You start wondering like, "And that guy is like crazy, crazy prideful, and that guy is
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.520]   like we can see it."
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.720]   Because if Apostle Paul can see it, I'm pretty sure other spiritual people can see it, right?
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.440]   I just want you to think about the whole scenario.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.240]   Wouldn't that be pretty like unnerving?
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.480]   Wouldn't you be really worried?
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.680]   And if you're one of those people who just like, you can't stand, you're like, "You know
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.680]   what?
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680]   We've got to put an end to this.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.920]   Apostle Paul, you need to write a scathing letter to that one fool who's like preaching
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.160]   right now, and we need to get together, and we need to squash that guy."
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.480]   And like, you know what I'm saying?
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.120]   You could imagine stuff like that happening.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.120]   I mean, I would feel it.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.600]   I'd be like, "What?
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.800]   We got to do something."
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:45.000]   But Apostle Paul has a desire to mature the church.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.920]   He has a desire to mature the church.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.160]   And so he actually asks this question.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.760]   We're jumping to the next section.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.400]   Section 3, verse 18 through 20.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   What then?
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.400]   What are we supposed to do about that?
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.960]   What are you supposed to think?
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.980]   Now, he answers in such a profoundly mature fashion.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:14.040]   He says, "Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed,
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.960]   and in this I rejoice.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.920]   Yes, I will rejoice."
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.000]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.800]   If we were to ask, "Man, where is the emphatic, like, center point?
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.880]   Where is the emphasis of this passage?"
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.280]   Clearly, there is such an emphasis right here.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.680]   He uses the rhetorical question, like, "What are we supposed to do about all this?
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.000]   What are we supposed to think?"
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.840]   And then he says, "In every single way, only that, right?
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.400]   In every way that this would happen, Christ would be proclaimed.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.400]   I rejoice.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.960]   Yes, I rejoice."
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:54.560]   Then he says this, "For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.440]   prayers and provisions of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to the earnest expectation
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:06.320]   and hope that I will not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:12.240]   will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or death."
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.920]   Okay, let's take a moment to camp out here, and then we'll wrap up the Bible study section
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.400]   of it.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.600]   Here, I want to say this.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   I just kind of transitioned by asking you, if you were to put yourself in that kind of
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.520]   situation, how would you feel about all that, right?
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.400]   How would you feel about the Apostle Paul and the other disciples are being imprisoned
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.400]   in this fashion?
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.880]   Run out of towns.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.220]   You would be worried, okay?
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:48.280]   But what's really mature and amazing about all this is that Apostle Paul does not base
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.280]   the success of the gospel on the person carrying it, right?
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.760]   There is such a confidence on the gospel truth of God.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.920]   There is such a confidence on the sufficiency of Scripture.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.760]   There is such a confidence in Christ.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:08.600]   And the ministry that God has already set into plan is bearing fruit.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:15.840]   And Apostle Paul is not conditioned to think, "Oh, goodness, because there is enemies, because
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.280]   there is bad preachers, because there's this and that, there's going to be such a sway
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   of ministry."
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.560]   No.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:28.760]   Apostle Paul has a mature way of thinking about what is his confidence.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:34.160]   And what's more, that confidence then is really his singular focus.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.320]   It's his, I like to call, massive purpose and goal.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.000]   It's like your number one desire.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.920]   This is what I want to see, right?
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.640]   This is what I want to see, this is what I love to see, and I'm thankful for it.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.800]   That Christ is proclaimed in every scenario.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.320]   Could it be that there's a mixed bag of stuff?
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.560]   Could it be you see weakness in the church?
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.840]   It's not ideal.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.000]   Could it be that there's threats here and there?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.720]   This is risky business?
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.260]   Yes.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.680]   But Apostle Paul has such, such confidence.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:14.280]   And so the emphasis there is where he has such confidence, there he finds such joy.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.080]   Where he finds such clear purpose, there he finds such joy.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:25.640]   Where he finds his number one desire, there he also finds his joy.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.680]   I put into your notes, more means more.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.440]   The more that he stakes everything on that one singular purpose, the more he's able to
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.800]   simply find joy in what God has established.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.280]   Let's take a moment to think about this for a little bit, okay?
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.720]   So here we have the double stars for emphasis.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.960]   But here there's a point I'm making to you.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.520]   Because Apostle Paul has firmly established his goal, his purpose, his desire upon this,
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:07.140]   that Christ be proclaimed, look at the effect it has on his subjective joy, right?
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.680]   Look at the effect it has on his subjective experience.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.800]   For example, Apostle Paul has a certain kind of confidence because he says, "You know what?
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.720]   I know.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.960]   This is what I know, that it's going to turn out for my deliverance."
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.000]   Does that sound like a wishy-washy, timid person who's not sure?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.080]   It's like, "I don't know what's going to happen to me, guys."
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   Right?
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.640]   "Maybe, maybe this."
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.920]   No, he says, "I know this is going to turn out for my deliverance."
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.080]   For through the provisions of the Spirit, so he's confident in this provision, the resource
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.320]   of God.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.680]   And then what's more, he says, "According to my earnest expectation and hope," so he has
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.880]   hope, "I will not be put to shame in anything."
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.440]   Think about this idea of like, "I'm not going to be put to shame."
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.640]   You know what that is?
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.080]   There is a level of clear conscience.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.480]   If he was a normal human being, he'd be absolutely ashamed.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.400]   There's nobody in this world who is chained to a guard or sitting in prison who's going
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.880]   to sit there like, "I've got my head up high.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.040]   Got no regrets, man."
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:14.360]   That kind of clarity of conscience comes when you've staked your life on something solid.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.280]   And what's more, he's got an incredible boldness.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.880]   He's got strength.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.840]   What am I saying here?
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:30.480]   We, at the beginning of the book of Philippians, we said, "The book is about joy.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.320]   The book is about rejoicing.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:39.800]   The book is about a kind of fruitful result of really knowing and having Christ."
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:45.000]   Apostle Paul here and now is modeling that in the midst of suffering.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.640]   And what he's doing is not looking at the circumstance.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   He's not looking at the people's response to a circumstance.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:57.880]   He's not simply even looking at his immediate hope and perspective.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.880]   What he's looking at is Christ's exaltation.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.380]   And he says, "Through that, I am going to rejoice."
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.720]   You know what's really crazy about all this?
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.960]   Did you guys get to ask the question of like, I know sometimes we run out of time, but how
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.720]   does Apostle Paul envision and think about this deliverance?
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.040]   Because it seems a little weird, right?
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:25.520]   Because for him to begin by saying, "Oh, I'm happy because my circumstance, which is my
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.240]   imprisonment, is producing all this good stuff.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.120]   People are finding out about Jesus Christ and learning.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.240]   And then what's more, they're being encouraged, and then they're being bold."
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.240]   And then he says, "I'm really confident that I'm going to be delivered."
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.400]   So then we have to ask the question, in his bucket of deliverance, what does that mean?
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   And what's very, very clear is that he does not mean that he's going to get out of prison
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.000]   and is going to be nice afterwards, right?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.180]   Apostle Paul defines this in such a much, in such a bigger way.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:09.600]   He judges this scenario by saying that he is going to turn out for his deliverance almost
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.920]   more like his victory.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.440]   It's going to be his deliverance almost more like his vindication, right?
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:21.800]   That he's not going to be ashamed, but rather in boldness, he is going to actually do what
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.480]   is his main goal.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:30.800]   He's going to be able to do what is his main objective, which is to exalt Christ, whether
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.120]   by life or by death.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:38.200]   Now, let me talk to this point a little bit, which is to say this.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.480]   This is such a major, major paradigm shift for everybody.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.080]   Why?
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:51.800]   A lot of times when I counsel individuals, I find that something very important to counseling
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.720]   is how do you judge the world?
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   How do you judge the world?
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.600]   What do I mean by that?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.200]   Certain life circumstances happen and we have a natural instinct to judge.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.440]   We have a natural instinct to say, "This is good.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440]   This is bad.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.440]   This is awesome.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.440]   This is sad."
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.440]   Right?
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.200]   And what's more, we have certain then criteria to judge that.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.400]   We will say something to the extent of, "You know what?
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.840]   I don't deserve this."
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.560]   And what that means is you are judging by your own worth.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:26.280]   If I am to be respected up here, then that that's happening in my life is not fair.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.860]   And that leads to the next part.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.360]   Sometimes we'll say things like, "This isn't right.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   This isn't fair."
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.080]   And what that means is we're judging by our sense of justice.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.200]   What's more, in moments when we say, "Oh, gosh.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   This sucks.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   This is horrible."
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   We're judging by our sense of preference.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   "This is good.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   This is bad."
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.040]   Based on the things that I like.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:49.480]   The reason why I say this is such a major paradigm shift is Apostle Paul is interpreting
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:58.200]   everything in his life, including his death, by the standard of, "Is Christ exalted?"
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.540]   And so this is a convicting point for every single one of us.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.520]   This is a huge paradigm shift.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.080]   Do you have such an operating principle?
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:12.500]   Do you have such a goal and desire that is so big it is encompassing the front and back
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:17.600]   of your life to the degree that even it makes sense of your death?
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.840]   And this is where I would start to conclude by saying this.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.120]   For Apostle Paul, what is he looking for?
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.000]   Apostle Paul, what is he desiring?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.080]   What is his expectation?
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   What is his hope?
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:35.120]   Man, what's really, really clear is that Apostle Paul is using the criteria and the rubric
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.280]   to say his hope is that which encompasses Christ.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.080]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:52.880]   That his entire existence, his entire existence, he has an absolute clarity.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.000]   There is no hesitation.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.680]   There is one singular focus by which he can answer the question, "Who are you and what
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.720]   do you live for?"
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:08.560]   And as he answers that, he is absolutely able to make sense of every single experience,
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.800]   every single suffering, including the prospect of death.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.380]   And that's a challenging question for you.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:21.220]   Some of us have a hard time making sense of the things that we go through in life.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.120]   Some of us have a hard time making sense of, "Why is this like this?
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.120]   Why am I like this?
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.440]   Why do I have to go through these hard times?"
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.140]   And we have knee-jerk reactions.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:37.160]   My question to you is, do you also have a growing clarity like Apostle Paul?
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:44.760]   Do you have such an ambition, such a goal, such a desire where a good life or even a
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.840]   good death is not because we simply live long enough, it's not simply because we've knocked
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.040]   off all the stuff of our bucket list, but it's because we have exalted the Lord?
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.160]   All right.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:03.400]   Let's take a moment to pray, and then you guys can jump into discussion.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:17.280]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much for the many servants, the many brothers and
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:24.080]   sisters we have that are encouraging us to exercise our faith.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:33.120]   And we are so thankful that here we have the example of Apostle Paul, who has tied himself,
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:39.680]   who has fully embraced your plan for him, and God, that he is desiring so eagerly to
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.880]   exalt you in his life.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:49.040]   Lord God, we pray that every single one of us in this room would also have that as our
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.600]   all-encompassing ambition.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.200]   We pray, Father God, that that desire in us would never grow stagnant.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:04.440]   It would be the constant beating, almost obsession of our mind that God, we need and we desire
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.800]   and we rejoice in Christ's exaltation.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:14.760]   I pray, Father God, that Lord, you would help us to put aside every other competing desire,
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.620]   to put aside every other competing distraction, Lord, and God, that we would desire to focus
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:24.360]   on you in such a way where God, we have such a clear interpretation and judgment on this
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.400]   world.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.000]   I pray, God, that we would be individuals living with such purpose.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   I pray, Father God, that we would be individuals living with such identity.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.400]   Lord, we thank you.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.000]   Pray for a fruitful time of discussion.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Amen.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.040]   Amen.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.880]   - Okay.
