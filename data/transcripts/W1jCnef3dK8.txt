[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - Good day everyone, and welcome to this sermon clip
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.320]   Wednesday on the podcast.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.960]   As most of you know, for a few weeks we've been looking
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.400]   at a two-part sermon series Pastor John delivered
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.520]   in the spring of 2010.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.080]   Historically, those sermons are interesting
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.400]   because they come in the days leading up
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.900]   to his eight-month leave of absence, away from the pulpit,
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.600]   to work some things out in his own heart
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.200]   and in his own family.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.380]   We talked about that leave itself and the lessons
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.800]   he took from it on the podcast,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.280]   particularly back in three episodes,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.860]   APJs 138, 220, and 1227.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.300]   It was a really defining eight-month season for Pastor John,
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.500]   but leading up to his leave,
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.380]   we get these two interesting sermons.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.580]   In them, Pastor John explained what makes himself tick.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.780]   Why does he do ministry the way that he does it?
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.620]   You might remember that.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.440]   We heard that answer in APJ 1769.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.160]   And then we looked at a related theme
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.840]   that God makes much of us.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.380]   He really does make much of us.
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.400]   And the question is why?
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.520]   Why does God make so much of us?
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.680]   That was APJ 1772.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.640]   And then we looked at how God makes much of us.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.180]   In six or seven profound ways,
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.440]   God makes much of his children.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.920]   Pastor John walked us through those points last time,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.280]   last Wednesday, in APJ 1775.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.080]   And today we return to that theme first brought up
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.560]   in APJ 1772, because there, Pastor John said this,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.680]   that God makes more of you
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.800]   when he makes much of you for his sake
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   than if he were to make much of you only for your sake.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.060]   That's a profound point worth thinking about deeply.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.640]   But it also raises a question in a lot of minds,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.260]   because if God makes much of me, if he saves me,
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.920]   because he's doing it to make much of himself,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.380]   doesn't that remove some of the luster of his love to me?
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.840]   That's the question on the table today,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.280]   and it's gonna be answered in both sermons,
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.760]   in the one on April 18th and in the next sermon,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.320]   the other sermon on April 25th,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.120]   both of course preached in 2010.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.620]   I'm gonna put two brief clips together here
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.600]   in this one episode.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.080]   And so to begin, here's Pastor John
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.780]   near the end of his first message,
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.920]   that message on April 18th.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.600]   Here's what he said.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.080]   - Now, last question.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.680]   The final decisive question,
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.560]   why does God, who loves us so much,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.880]   who makes much of us so extremely,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.280]   why does he remind us over and over and over again
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.520]   when he tells us how much he loves us
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.360]   and how much he's making much of us,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.040]   how much he's making much of us,
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.400]   why does he keep reminding us
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.120]   that he's doing it for his glory?
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.520]   To ruin it?
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.740]   No.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.960]   Why does God remind us over and over
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.520]   that he makes much of us in a way
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.420]   that is designed to make much of him?
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.720]   The answer is, loving you this way is a greater love.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.880]   God's love for you that makes much of you for his glory
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.040]   is a greater love for you
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   than if he ended by making much of you, period.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.280]   If he just made much of you as your greatest treasure
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.860]   rather than him as your greatest treasure.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.120]   If he did everything he could do
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.680]   to help you feel like a treasure
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.360]   rather than helping you feel like he's the greatest treasure
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.040]   he would not love you so much.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.440]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.920]   The reason this is a greater love is that self,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.120]   no matter how glorified,
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.380]   cannot satisfy the heart that is made for God.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.820]   I'll say it again, bottom line answer.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.500]   The reason it's a greater love to love you for his sake
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.900]   and a greater love to make much of you
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.700]   that he might be made much of,
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.500]   the reason that's greater is that a self,
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.380]   no matter how gloriously it looks in the age to come,
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.880]   cannot satisfy a heart that is made for God.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.300]   If he is to satisfy the magnificence of the human heart
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.720]   which is made for him,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.340]   he must make much of himself for you
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.340]   in making much of you.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.740]   He will not let your glory,
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.900]   which he himself creates and delights in,
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.720]   replace his glory as your supreme treasure.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.980]   He will not let your glory,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.820]   which he creates and delights in,
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.900]   replace his glory as your supreme treasure.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.060]   If he did, he would not love you so much.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.720]   So Bethlehem, I'll be away in a little over a week.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.980]   And I want you to feel this.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.300]   I want you to feel massively loved while I'm gone.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.260]   I intend to feel massively loved while I'm away.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.820]   And I would like to know that here,
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.260]   because the Holy Spirit is coming down,
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.500]   there's a tide rising.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   What?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.820]   How much?
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.380]   How much we are loved as a people.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.820]   That's what I would like to know.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.780]   You, Bethlehem, are precious to God
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.120]   and the greatest gift he has for you
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.200]   is not to let your preciousness become your God.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.120]   Say it again.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.400]   You, Bethlehem, are precious to God.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.660]   I don't know if it would be theologically overstated
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.760]   to say infinitely precious since he paid Jesus,
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.360]   but let's just say immeasurably, unspeakably,
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.280]   gloriously precious to God.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.080]   And his great gift to you,
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.440]   which brings his love to its apex,
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.540]   is that he will not let your sense of being precious to him
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.760]   become your God.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.200]   He will be your God forever.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.040]   - Amen.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.680]   So that was near the end of sermon one,
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.080]   but the topic carries over.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.320]   So I'll fast forward one week later
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.720]   and we'll pick up the same discussion
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   in the beginning of his next sermon.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.400]   And that's where we pick up right now.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.920]   - Here's a prayer from Ephesians.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.760]   You don't need to look it up.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.360]   Just listen carefully.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.280]   Chapter three, verse 18.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.360]   "I pray," this is Paul now praying for the Ephesians
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.340]   in the way I pray for you, for myself, for my family.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.440]   "I pray that you may have strength
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.620]   "to know the love of Christ."
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.480]   You can't know it without power.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.440]   Does that strike you as odd?
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.200]   You should give a lot of thought to that.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.760]   Why can't I know what it is to be loved without divine power?
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.800]   I'll keep reading that prayer.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.600]   "I pray that you may have strength
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   "to comprehend with all the saints
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.560]   "what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   "and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.800]   "surpasses the powers of the mind
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.620]   "to comprehend and the powers of the human heart
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.540]   "to experience."
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.500]   It surpasses our fallen capacities
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.660]   to handle with our brain and to experience with our heart.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.540]   It goes beyond what you're able to do,
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.280]   which is why Paul is praying,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.280]   and why I pray for myself this way and for you this way.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.020]   "May you have strength to comprehend
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.780]   "the love of Christ."
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.260]   Soul strength, heart strength, mind strength.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.580]   "May God give this to us now."
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.340]   Now.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.340]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:26.780]   This is why Paul said in Romans 5, verse 5,
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.780]   "God's love has been poured into our hearts
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.340]   "through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.180]   The love of God pours into you,
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.060]   not by any human agency,
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.080]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.580]   It's a divine thing to know you're self-loved by God.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.080]   You're not able to on your own.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.740]   Now, the question I posed last week was,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.260]   why is it that the Bible reveals the love of God for us,
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.460]   including God's making so much of us,
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.540]   why is it that he reveals his love for us,
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.940]   his making so much of us,
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.940]   in ways that constantly call attention to his own glory?
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.900]   Why does he do it that way?
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.820]   And the answer is this.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.300]   If God didn't do it that way,
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.700]   if he didn't love us in a way
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.660]   that constantly called attention back to his glory
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.180]   as the source, as the essence, as the goal,
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.420]   if he didn't do it that way,
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.180]   we would be so much more likely to turn the love of God
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.860]   into a subtle means of self-exaltation.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.220]   We would use his love to make ourselves
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.860]   the deepest foundation of our joy,
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.180]   instead of himself.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.980]   God would become the servant of our slavery to self.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.700]   We would take our preciousness to God
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:15.220]   and make that very preciousness to God our God.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:21.540]   But I argued, God loves us so much.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.060]   We are so precious to him
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.100]   that he will not let that happen.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:35.980]   We are so precious to God that God in great mercy
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.260]   will not let our preciousness to him become our God.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.420]   We will indeed, hear this carefully,
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.820]   we will indeed through all eternity
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.180]   enjoy being made much of by God.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.980]   That will be a profound ingredient in our joy in God,
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:08.980]   that he makes so much of his sons and his daughters,
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:16.700]   but he will work in us such a holiness,
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.500]   such a sanctification, such a freedom from sin,
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.500]   that he will protect us from making
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.580]   that the bottom of our joy.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.940]   The bottom of our joy will always be
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.940]   that he's the kind of God who delights in us.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.580]   The bottom of our joy will always be
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.020]   that he's the kind of God who makes much of the likes of me.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.900]   This grace, this grace will be the apex of my joy,
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.660]   the apex of my praise forever.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.340]   The apex of my praise forever.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.820]   It will never terminate here, it will always go back there
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.220]   from him, through him and to him are all things.
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.820]   God himself will be the beginning, the middle and the end
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.420]   in his love for me.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.220]   - Profound truth being explained here.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.740]   We are so precious to God that God in great mercy
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.740]   will not let our preciousness to him become our God.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.180]   That is deep and worth meditating on.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.580]   Today you heard sermon clips from two different sermons.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.660]   The first one was from his April 18, 2010 sermon titled,
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.460]   "How Much Does God Love This Church?"
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.340]   And the second was from his April 25, 2010 sermon titled,
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.360]   "Consider Your Calling."
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.860]   And of course, both full sermons are available online
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.740]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.940]   I found these clips, if you find one, email it to me.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.780]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.540]   and timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.060]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.060]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.380]   and send it to me and askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.140]   That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.780]   Well, we have a really sharp Bible question
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.740]   coming up on Friday.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.980]   I'll just leave it there.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.120]   No spoilers.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.500]   I'm your host Tony Reike and we are rejoined in studio
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.580]   with Pastor John when we return on Friday.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.420]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.260]   Thanks for listening.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:26.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
