[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:02.460]   Lord, we would not just be engaged in a mental exercise,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.100]   but God, that we would be truly worshiping you,
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.340]   even through study, even through our singing,
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.340]   and just reflecting on the words that we read and we hear.

[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:22.860]   - All right.
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:32.220]   Let me go ahead and read our passage today for us.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:39.980]   It's 1 Peter 3, verses 8 to 16.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.340]   "To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic,
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:51.540]   "brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit,
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.340]   "not returning evil for evil or insult for insult,
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.980]   "but giving a blessing instead.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.220]   "For you were called for the very purpose
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.920]   "that you might inherit a blessing.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.900]   "For the one who desires life to love and see good days
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.420]   "must keep his tongue from evil
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.060]   "and his lips from speaking deceit.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.860]   "He must turn away from evil and do good.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.380]   "He must seek peace and pursue it.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.920]   "For the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.360]   "and his ears attend to their prayer.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.820]   "But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.980]   "Who is there to harm you
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.420]   "if you prove zealous for what is good?
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.640]   "But even if you should suffer
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.900]   "for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.160]   "And do not fear their intimidation and do not be troubled.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.400]   "But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.620]   "always being ready to make a defense
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.600]   "to everyone who asks you to give an account
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.420]   "for the hope that is in you.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.660]   "Yet with gentleness and respect, or reverence,
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.860]   "and keep a good conscience
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.180]   "so that in the thing in which you are slandered,
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.180]   "those who revile your good behavior in Christ
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.620]   "will be put to shame."
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.620]   So that's gonna be our lengthiest passage for 1 Peter.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.580]   Okay, so normally you guys know we do
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.980]   about five or six verses, but today is nine.
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:14.600]   So the first two questions you guys know,
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.360]   they're just your observations and your questions
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.600]   from the nine verses.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.660]   But question number three, it reads,
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.960]   "What is the context of these Old Testament quotes?"
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.760]   Okay, I'm not sure how much you guys
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.560]   were able to go into those,
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.360]   but they are somewhat significant, okay?
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.440]   So if you guys have time, please do discuss that.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.080]   And then at 8.20, we'll see you again, okay,
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.620]   for our brief time of wrap-up.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.860]   But let me pray for us,
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.260]   and then we'll go into our time as small group.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:51.800]   Lord, we thank you for just giving us
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.760]   just a week and a half just to reflect,
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:01.320]   to not only reflect on our union with Christ in his death,
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.640]   but also as we've celebrated this weekend,
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.840]   just our union with Christ in his resurrection.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.080]   And that means everything.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.600]   And so as we reflect on the ramifications
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.720]   of our union with you in your resurrection,
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.440]   I pray for much grace on our conversation,
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.580]   on our discussion.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:26.040]   Help us, Lord God, really to be a people of conviction,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:31.080]   of grace, of gentleness, and humility.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   And would you guide and facilitate our time
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   so that all of our conversation is edifying.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.400]   And I pray, Lord, that you would just bless our time
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.960]   and help us to glean much from it.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.840]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.320]   All right, we'll see you guys at 8.20.

[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:03.940]   And let me pray for us before we jump into the wrap up.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:12.660]   Father, this was a very lengthy and a meaty passage.
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:17.460]   But Lord, there is so much for us to glean from it.
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.460]   Help us not to just look at these adjectives and look
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:26.260]   at these exhortations and just skim through them.
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.940]   But help us, Lord God, to just dive deeply,
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.900]   to remember Christ's own example.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:38.180]   And Lord, to appropriately apply these verses
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:41.940]   in our hearts and in our lives.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:50.860]   Not for our enjoyment or any acclaim for ourselves.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:54.860]   But really, Lord God, that your name would be honored
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.300]   through not only our life, but our doctrine as well.
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.300]   So we pray for your help.
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:03.780]   And we ask all of these things in Jesus' name.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:08.680]   [ Pause ]
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:09.080]   All right.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:12.380]   So you guys are well aware we're living
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:18.460]   in a very fallen world, right?
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:23.360]   Peter's audience was living in a very fallen world.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:29.100]   And I just did a sweep through starting from chapter one,
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:30.540]   what it means to be a Christian
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:33.540]   in a fallen world just according to Peter.
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:36.540]   And these things can apply not just for Peter's context,
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.340]   but for ours as well, right?
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:42.840]   So I just wanted to review what does it mean for a Christian
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.220]   to be living in a hostile Gentile world.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:51.080]   First thing that is mentioned is we are resident aliens.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   This is not home.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.300]   Okay? So this is not where we find comfort.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:00.700]   The second thing is there is the evidence of a lot of fiery
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:03.600]   trials and sufferings that lead to distress.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.260]   And that's a very common theme in 1 Peter as you can just see
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:08.600]   by the number of verses that are there.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.980]   And there are a lot of accusations and slander.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.480]   Okay? Accusations are things that are closer to the truth,
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.120]   but that are being hurled as insults anyway or offenses.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.000]   Slander is a straight up made up lie, right?
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.800]   So that's there.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:34.000]   The Gentile world around us, there's ignorance, folly,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.560]   disobedience, and darkness.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.340]   There are unreasonable superiors, whether it's
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:45.780]   like an abusive husband, a bad boss, a tyrant.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:48.440]   Okay? So that's a reality.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.720]   And there's even satanic attack that we'll see.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.220]   Okay? So this is the reality of our fallen world.
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.780]   So far it's easy to follow, right?
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:04.460]   But then at the same time, we're living in sin-tainted bodies.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:08.200]   So we are saved, but we are still being saved.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.040]   We're dead, but we're still dying.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.740]   Right? And there is still within all of us a desire
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:19.700]   when we're wronged not to pay back and injure tooth for tooth,
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.620]   eye for eye, foot for foot.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:25.920]   Right? What we want is you take my tooth,
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.660]   I'll take your mouth and your nose.
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.060]   That's human nature.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.860]   And that still resides, there's residual effect
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.920]   in every believer too.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.260]   Right? And so living as heaven's heirs while still
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.500]   in sin-tainted flesh is also reality.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.540]   So there's realness of former lusts,
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:46.440]   and there's exhortations don't conform anymore.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.040]   Stop being what you formerly were.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.440]   There's exhortations there.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.880]   And there are sinful patterns
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.480]   that need to be actively put aside.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.780]   So we actually need to really try hard to cast off stuff
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.360]   and long for the word, as we've learned in the previous lessons.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.120]   And we have a natural tendency to drift and stray.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.600]   Okay? And there's a desire for retaliation.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.560]   Raise your hand if you like to retaliate.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.660]   Or there is a desire in there in your heart.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:18.340]   All of you, all of you guys should.
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:20.440]   Right? Every single one.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.780]   Even my wife, who is a superhuman awesome person.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.700]   Oh, there's retaliation in her.
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.820]   Right? So we all have that.
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:31.880]   So we're living in a very hostile, fallen,
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.260]   sin-tainted, sin-corrupted world.
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:38.920]   And we ourselves haven't fully escaped yet.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.320]   So this is the reality. Okay?
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.320]   And that's the context.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.020]   But God understanding this in His sovereignty
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:49.860]   still ordains order.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:52.040]   Still ordains structure.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.160]   Still allows for hierarchy,
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.240]   even though there can be harm and abuse in the system.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.440]   Okay? So these are the things that we covered
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.620]   over the last few weeks.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:11.120]   We looked at submitting to rulers and to authorities.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.420]   Remember, we are tainted.
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.060]   The system is tainted.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:19.500]   We are servants or submit to their masters.
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.100]   Chapter 3, 1 through 6, wives submit to their husbands.
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.300]   And then verse 7, it doesn't say the word submit,
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.400]   but the idea is the same.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.640]   You submit yourself to the needs
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.940]   in consideration of the wife, husband.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:35.240]   So these are all the different hierarchies
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.140]   and structures that God has placed
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.420]   because God is not a God of chaos or confusion.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:40.680]   He's a God of order.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.720]   1 Corinthians 14, 33.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:47.860]   And in the middle of this is Christ's example.
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:52.500]   And if we were ever to say, "Well, that's not fair."
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.400]   Well, praise God it wasn't fair.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.400]   Praise God that Christ did not treat us fairly.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.140]   Right? So that's the example.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:04.480]   Now, it's a little bit tricky to try to understand
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.240]   like how to function in all of this
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.380]   when we're living in a sin-tainted, corrupted world,
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:10.680]   when we ourselves are sinners,
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.980]   but we're called to follow Christ's examples.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:14.080]   And we're enabled to do that
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.660]   because the Spirit of God is within us.
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:20.700]   And this is where things might get a little bit messy
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.160]   and hard to kind of put a finger on.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.700]   So there is an explanation that takes place.
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.700]   Okay?
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:32.940]   But if you guys recall, 1 Peter 2, 23,
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:35.240]   it's similar to today's passage
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.740]   where Jesus, while being reviled,
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.980]   He did not revile in return.
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:44.640]   While suffering, He uttered no threats,
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.660]   but He kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:53.560]   God, my Father, is good.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.400]   His will is perfect.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.800]   He is absolutely in control.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:01.100]   And His justice is perfect.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:07.140]   So I will willingly submit my fate to my Father in heaven.
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.900]   And He did that all the way to the cross.
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:11.380]   Praise God.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:12.380]   Right?
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:13.680]   And that was a characteristic and quality
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.880]   of Jesus' entire life.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.880]   So that's kind of by way of review
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.720]   and a little bit of an overview
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.060]   so we can kind of hedge in our passage today.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:25.120]   I did not like doing nine verses all at once.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.280]   Did you guys?
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.060]   That's a lot, right?
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:33.060]   But fortunately, it breaks down in some ways
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:37.000]   that you can easily track.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.240]   The first section of this part,
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:46.000]   just my-- this is my personal way I titled it.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.740]   It's the character of those blessed of God.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.540]   Okay, the character of those blessed of God.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.180]   And then the bottom part,
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:59.080]   the response of those blessed of God to the reviler.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.680]   So the character of those blessed of God,
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.480]   it's still in flux.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.220]   We're still growing, right?
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:08.920]   But in the situation where there is an offense,
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:12.220]   how do the blessed respond?
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.260]   And that's the bottom part.
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:17.100]   And the what is the bottom, the response,
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:21.600]   and the how that response is supposed to look is the top.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.260]   You guys tracking?
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:31.900]   So that first line of columns is the subsections, the two.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.740]   And if I had to add three more verses in there,
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.080]   I would kind of fit that there too.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.280]   But in these nine verses, this is how I did it.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:40.920]   The second little column,
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.920]   these are all the Christian character
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:46.080]   and the Christian response.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.360]   I'm hoping you see that.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.620]   The Christian character, harmonious, sympathetic,
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:53.220]   brotherly, kindhearted, humble, not returning evil,
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.020]   giving a blessing, keeping the tongue from evil,
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.900]   turning away from evil, doing good,
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.340]   seeking peace, pursuing it,
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:03.600]   and then going down, proving zealous for what is good,
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:08.100]   not fearing, not troubled, and keeping a good conscience.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:09.780]   Not sure if you see that, right?
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:11.480]   These are all almost adjectival.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:17.740]   These are all things that a Christian is and strives to be.
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.040]   You guys got that?
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:22.320]   We're growing, but we're not fully there yet.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.720]   So we're continuing to grow in this.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.860]   The red bold is more future hope.
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.260]   It's difficult for me to read this passage
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:34.160]   and think this applies to our life here.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:37.340]   It's difficult to see that.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.540]   Would you guys agree with that?
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:43.480]   A lot of it, he's like, "Suffering, suffering, suffering,
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.840]   but blessing on this life."
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:49.120]   I don't think that--the feel of that is not there, okay?
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.080]   The blessing is for an eternal relationship with God
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.320]   for whom we were created.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:57.360]   That is in and of itself the blessing, okay?
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.300]   So that's what I see the red bold is.
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.460]   The underlined words are,
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:06.100]   because this is an Old Testament quote,
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.740]   "The active righteous response of those who have tasted
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.280]   and seen that the Lord is good."
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:11.300]   Have you guys heard that verse before?
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.940]   "Taste and see that the Lord is good."
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:16.480]   That's Psalm 34, okay?
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.480]   The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and knows those--
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.460]   I forget the rest of the verse.
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.160]   The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and is near--
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.800]   what's the verse?
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:29.820]   Sorry, everybody at home.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:31.560]   Anyway, you guys know that verse, right?
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.360]   Pay attention to what I mean, all right?
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.960]   So that's all Psalm 34.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.960]   Psalm 34 is a well-read, beloved Old Testament passage.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:44.540]   And so all of those sayings of the righteous person
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.200]   who's tasted and seen that the Lord is good,
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.440]   I just underlined it.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.280]   And then the light blue highlights
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.580]   are all the fear and terror words again.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.140]   Remember, we've mentioned how the fear word
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:58.180]   comes out a lot, okay?
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:59.920]   "Do not fear their fear,"
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.380]   is literally how it's actually written.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:05.600]   And then, "Do this with gentleness and fear."
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.420]   The LSB actually says, "Do this with gentleness and fear,"
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:10.820]   when you're giving people a defense.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:13.960]   And then the yellow highlight is the one main imperative.
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:17.720]   All right, there aren't many verbs in this passage.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.180]   Did you guys pick up on that?
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.360]   There's one main imperative, and what is that?
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.600]   "Set Christ as holy in your heart."
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.120]   Set him apart, sanctify him, okay?
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.800]   And then the third column are all the subordinate ideas.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.800]   So that's how I just kind of piece this visually
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.580]   to kind of track the flow of thought.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.740]   And I wanna spend a little bit of time
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:44.300]   on the two Old Testament passages
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:47.640]   that have been mentioned here, okay?
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.400]   This is Psalm 34, verse seven to 19.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.160]   And I wanna look to the right first to the context.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.520]   So the title of Psalm 34, it's a psalm written by David
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.800]   when he pretended to be crazy
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.440]   before Abimelech, Akish, the king of Gath.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:07.960]   There's a lot of Abimelechs,
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.960]   as there are a lot of pharaohs and a lot of hereds.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.680]   Abimelech can both be a name and a title, okay?
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:17.080]   But his name is Akish.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:21.400]   So this is a poem, the proverb is written in a poem
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:24.840]   that's easy to memorize, because it's like A,
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.880]   in the Hebrew letter, alef, beth, gimel, dalet,
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.120]   it's in order, okay?
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:34.240]   So people who grow up in the Judaic culture,
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.620]   a Jewish culture, they would be able
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:37.920]   to kind of recall all of these things, okay?
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:44.360]   So David is being reviled and pursued by sinful kings.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.540]   He has to run away from Saul,
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:52.240]   and then he encounters the king of Gath, Akish,
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.640]   and then he has to pretend to be crazy, right?
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.380]   And then he runs, so he is constantly surrounded
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:03.000]   by a pagan governing system that's out for his harm.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:10.540]   But he is delivered miraculously, and he's given victory,
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:16.520]   because God gives that to his anointed person.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.200]   And that's the feel of Psalm 34.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.120]   And I wanna read this for you, okay?
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:23.680]   And notice the word fear also mentioned in here.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:26.400]   The black bold is what you saw in 1 Peter.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:31.520]   The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.560]   The angel of the Lord is only mentioned three times
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.000]   in all of the Proverbs, okay?
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.200]   So it's a very special person here, okay?
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.720]   The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.320]   and rescues them.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.800]   Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.880]   How blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.800]   Oh, fear the Lord, you his saints,
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.120]   for those who fear him, there is no want.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.640]   The young lions do lack and suffer hunger,
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.160]   but they who seek the Lord shall not be in want
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.880]   of any good thing.
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.800]   Come, you children, listen to me.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.520]   I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.760]   Who is the man who desires life and loves length of days
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:09.360]   and he may see good?
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.920]   Keep your tongue from evil and your lips
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.180]   from speaking deceit.
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:13.560]   Depart from evil and do good.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.020]   Seek peace and pursue it.
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:17.080]   The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.120]   and his ears are open to their cry.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.240]   The face of the Lord is against evildoers
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.080]   to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.480]   The righteous cry and the Lord hears
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.540]   and he delivers them out of all their troubles.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.680]   The Lord is near to the brokenhearted
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.200]   and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.440]   There you go, okay.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.120]   Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:41.080]   but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:44.240]   He keeps all his bones, not one of them is broken.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.080]   So this is a very well-known context
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.920]   which Peter the Jew just naturally would
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.180]   just launch into as he's writing.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:39:00.000]   God is the one we need to fear and entrust ourselves to.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.080]   Everything else is actually inconsequential
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.440]   because he is faithful to preserve and protect
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.000]   those whom he loves.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.660]   Okay, so that's Psalm 34.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:16.480]   The next passage that's written on the bottom part,
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:19.920]   the what part, is out of Isaiah chapter eight.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.040]   Okay, Isaiah seven, you have a Christmas passage.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:26.820]   Isaiah nine, you have a Christmas passage.
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:29.620]   You guys know for the virgin will conceive?
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:31.200]   That's Isaiah 7, 14.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.160]   Unto us a child is born, unto us a king is given.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.560]   His name will be wonderful counselor,
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.760]   eternal father, mighty God.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.240]   You guys know that one, right?
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.240]   But right smack in that context is fear, okay?
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:51.480]   So there's a civil war between Israel and Judah.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:54.120]   Israel is rebellious.
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:58.400]   Judah's not that much better, but God is faithful to Judah.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.380]   And there's a common enemy, Assyria,
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.140]   that's growing in power.
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.140]   And if you guys have done any OT survey stuff,
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:07.540]   Assyrians are wicked people, right?
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:10.140]   And they're strong and they're scary.
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:13.140]   So the king of Israel and the king of Syria,
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:17.140]   the northern kingdom, the wicked nation, and Syria,
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:21.340]   what they wanna try to do is, hey, we need you Ahaz.
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:25.200]   We need to all unite our forces so we can defeat Assyria.
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:30.680]   You better join us or else, okay?
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.960]   But Ahaz refuses that alliance.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.600]   But now he's scared.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:40.440]   He's like, oh shoot, I refused to ally with my enemies
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.140]   to fight another enemy in Assyria.
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:46.840]   Maybe what I will do is I will go to Assyria,
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:50.500]   unite myself with them, and we will be protected.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:53.200]   So he's thinking practical.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.680]   He's thinking what human way can I get
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:58.880]   out of this situation and not be harmed?
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.880]   Isaiah the prophet speaks into this.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:07.520]   Okay, so Ahaz is considering joining with Assyria,
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.320]   but Isaiah warns the king against this ungodly alliance.
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.420]   And that's the passage that is being read.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.600]   Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.280]   State a proposal, but it will not stand.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.200]   For God is with us.
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:25.800]   For thus the Lord spoke to me with mighty power
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:27.740]   and instructed me not to walk in the way
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:31.220]   of this people, saying, you are not to say
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:33.340]   it is conspiracy in regard to all
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:35.200]   that this people call a conspiracy.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:41.180]   You are not to fear what they fear or be in dread of it.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:47.620]   It is the Lord of hosts whom you should regard as holy.
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.580]   And he shall be your fear.
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:53.180]   He shall be your dread.
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:57.480]   So when you're looking at the first Peter passage,
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:02.620]   do you guys see the connection?
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:08.920]   What can man do to us, at the very least, kill our bodies?
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.180]   Right?
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:14.460]   But if God is for us, who can be against us?
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:19.640]   We who are protected by the power of God for salvation.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.280]   Right?
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.940]   So the fear really needs to be directed
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:29.140]   toward the God who is creator of the universe,
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:33.400]   who is holy, holy, holy, and whatever physical suffering
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.180]   that he may ordain, we entrust ourselves to him
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.060]   the way the Son entrusted himself to the Father.
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:41.540]   And that's the context.
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.820]   Okay?
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:44.640]   So then,
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.820]   what does that mean for
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.360]   you and me?
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.060]   What does it mean to sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts?
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:57.140]   Do you guys think that one, like, think about that one?
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:59.140]   That's the main command, right?
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.980]   What does it mean to sanctify
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:06.300]   the Lord in my heart?
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:16.260]   What is the goal of, if I were to tell you
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:20.680]   the goal of my marriage
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:26.720]   is to not cheat on my wife,
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.720]   you guys would think that's a weird goal.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.720]   Right?
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.420]   The goal of my marriage is oneness with my wife.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:40.700]   The goal of my marriage is to love my wife
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:44.160]   and to be loved and grow in that oneness.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.440]   It's not to see how much I can get away with,
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:52.000]   what benefits I can glean, and still stay married.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.580]   To sanctify the Lord in your hearts
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:01.680]   is really, what this means is I am pursuing
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.740]   to love the Lord my God with all my heart,
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:09.180]   all my soul, all my mind, and all my strength.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:11.940]   That's where my attention is going to.
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:15.380]   My efforts are not going to be a better,
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:17.840]   like, it's not to become a better Christian.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:21.780]   Or to see how much I can get away with
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:23.380]   and still have access to heaven.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:27.300]   Are you guys following this line of thought?
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:32.200]   To sanctify the Lord Jesus Christ in my heart as Lord,
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.240]   it means I am wholeheartedly devoting myself
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.940]   to pursuing him.
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:38.380]   This is eternal life, that they may know you
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:40.740]   the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:43.900]   My desire in my relationship with God,
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:47.260]   the blessing that we see in 1 Peter, is to know him.
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:52.640]   My focus is not going to be on how much can I get away with,
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.600]   well if I do this, is that a sin?
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:58.520]   If I go there and I eat that food, is that a sin?
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.560]   Is it okay to buy a Tesla, that truck that's coming out?
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.960]   And if I buy that, is that a sin?
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.800]   Right?
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:09.640]   Or how many drinks can I have before it becomes a sin?
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:11.440]   You just missed the point.
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.740]   It's like me telling you, I am so excited
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:18.040]   to be married to Becky so that I don't cheat.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.680]   That's a very strange way to say that.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:25.840]   But for me, to sanctify Christ as Lord in my heart
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.200]   is he's all I want.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.000]   He's the blessing.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.760]   And whether I get there in a year or 50 years,
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.240]   I'm gonna have him.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.080]   I'm gonna know him.
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:38.600]   That's the hope that is in me.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:43.200]   So if people are asking me,
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:45.240]   hey what's the reason for the hope that you have
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.280]   in the midst of cancer?
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.360]   What's the reason for the hope that you have
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.000]   in the trials that you are suffering?
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.680]   What's the reason for the hope that you have
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.620]   in the middle of this painful life crisis?
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:59.240]   I don't need to say, oh well let me get back to you
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:03.040]   'cause I haven't read enough about apologetics.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:06.940]   Oh you know what, I don't quite know all there is to know
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:11.940]   about the stance on, I don't know, vaccines.
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:13.680]   I'm just throwing that out there.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.740]   I don't know.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:19.280]   But a lot of times we think that we need to learn
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.520]   how to logically argue someone into belief.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:28.360]   But you know when you are in love with Christ,
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:31.540]   it glows out your body.
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:39.480]   And your reasoning for the defense of the hope
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:44.440]   that is in you, not self-righteous,
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.600]   not condemning of other people,
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.380]   but you're just so thankful and humbled
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:53.000]   that God loves you that you just start preaching,
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.760]   but it doesn't sound preachy
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.240]   because you're just sharing your life testimony
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:02.240]   because you have sanctified Christ as Lord in your heart.
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:05.560]   I don't even need to talk about not cheating on my wife
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.820]   if I'm absolutely in love with Becky.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:11.440]   Because that would not even cross your mind.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.800]   Because you're like, man, that's a man who loves his wife.
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:17.160]   And that's what this passage is.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.300]   For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer.
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:26.400]   I will pursue my Lord and set him apart
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.080]   and fear him only.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.200]   I am gonna love the Lord my God with all my heart,
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:33.960]   all my soul, all my mind, and all my strength.
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.700]   And the natural byproduct of that
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:38.600]   is I'm gonna have his heart
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.520]   and I'm gonna be loving my neighbor as myself
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.560]   with compassion, with tender heartedness,
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.860]   with sympathy, with humility of spirit,
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:51.780]   with gentleness and fear, not of them, but of who?
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:54.220]   Christ.
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:57.080]   And it's not a terror fear.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:02.000]   It's more of a I am so fearful
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.640]   of disappointing the one I love.
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.640]   And he is worthy of trust.
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.360]   So that's this passage.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:14.240]   All of these qualities that you should have as a Christian
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.520]   are natural byproducts.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.960]   You know how people say?
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:19.440]   It's kind of hard for people to say of us
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:22.840]   'cause my wife and I, sheer size is so different.
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:24.760]   But people do say, you guys look similar,
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:26.760]   especially when they look at a family photo.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.320]   You guys are looking more and more similar
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.200]   as we're getting older.
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.120]   I mean, you might disagree, but that's what I've heard.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.480]   I can start predicting what my wife is gonna do.
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:37.920]   I can start predicting what she's gonna choose
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.080]   and how she's gonna think because we've been together
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.720]   for 15 plus years in marriage.
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:48.440]   As you grow in intimate knowledge, oh, the Lord,
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.400]   these are things that naturally develop
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.840]   as byproducts of your life
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:57.000]   because you were purposed to inherit this blessing
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.600]   of knowing God and to be intimately known with him.
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.200]   Are you guys following this?
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:08.560]   So you don't need to try to explain why you love the Lord
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:11.560]   if you're pursuing love for the Lord.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:15.800]   You have to work hard to try to explain
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:18.960]   and almost justify why you believe in God
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:21.080]   when he is just your religious figurehead.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:25.440]   And that's the thrust of this passage.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.560]   Life is gonna start throwing
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.460]   a lot of painful curve balls your way.
[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:33.960]   But no matter what the circumstance,
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.800]   you sanctify Christ as Lord.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:41.800]   So next week's passage is only six verses.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.960]   It's chapter three, verse 17 to 22.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:49.880]   And the question that, number five
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:51.280]   is the one that's different.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.840]   Next week's passage is gonna throw you all
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:57.240]   kind of like for a little bit of like a huh,
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.240]   what does this mean?
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:01.680]   It's how does Christ's being made alive
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:05.640]   in the spirit affect us according to this passage?
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:08.200]   Okay, so kind of have that in the back of your minds.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.620]   If you guys haven't looked at it yet,
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:10.600]   once you look at it, you'll be like,
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.720]   oh, that's what PPC's talking about, right?
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.160]   The passage, there's gonna be a lot of questions
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.000]   that come up.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:22.520]   For today, question number one,
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.640]   which of the exhortations in these verses
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:27.400]   do you struggle most to exhibit in your day-to-day life?
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:32.320]   Is it, are you zealous to do what is good?
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.520]   Are people harming you because your personality
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.240]   is kind of stinky?
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.920]   Are you zealous for doing what is good?
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:43.040]   Are you humble, are you gentle, are you sympathetic?
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:44.860]   What are all these qualities that are there?
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:47.080]   When someone cuts you off on the street,
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.400]   do you revile and return?
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:52.360]   What do you struggle with?
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.720]   And the second question that I want you guys
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.600]   to share in your group is how ready are you
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.560]   to articulate the hope that is in you?
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.240]   Do you have hope in you?
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:07.960]   And then the second one is more of just prayer support
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:10.600]   for your growth in your faith.
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.360]   Are there specific ways your group members
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:16.000]   can pray for you as you grow to sanctify Christ as Lord
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.900]   in the areas of your life and witness?
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:23.160]   So those are the questions that I'm gonna leave you with.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:25.200]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll break up
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.380]   into our small group sharing time.
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:34.120]   Lord, we ask that you would
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:40.400]   just grant your grace in our lives
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.600]   and cause us, Lord God, in the areas
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:47.080]   where we need repentance, just to repent
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:49.520]   and to embrace you
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:56.160]   and really to reflect your kindness and goodness
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.280]   as we live day to day.
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:02.020]   Lord, help us to sanctify you as Lord in our hearts.
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:06.860]   And Lord, would you fill us more and more
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:08.360]   just with a greater passion
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.740]   when we will fully know you,
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:14.000]   when we see you face to face,
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.760]   when we will receive fully
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:20.600]   the actualization of this blessed hope.
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.800]   So we thank you, Lord, for our time together.
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:26.080]   We pray for a good, fruitful time of sharing and praying.
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:27.880]   And we pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:37.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
