[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   All right.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.480]   Thanks Ryan for your testimony.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.080]   And I think that's what we're trying to do here.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.960]   We're trying to see those many years ago how the life of Christ and the death of Christ
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.240]   and the resurrection of Christ applies to people thousands of years later just like
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.920]   Ryan.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.960]   That's what we're doing every single day this week.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.720]   As we get to Tuesday, that that wasn't just then.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.800]   That Jesus was actually actively and intentionally, just as we learned both on Sunday and yesterday,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.880]   intentionally moving his way towards the cross so that people like you and me could have
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.500]   life.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.640]   And we're going to be continuing this observation of Jesus' walk on the cross today.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640]   This is Tuesday.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.040]   And what we see on Tuesday is kind of a heightening of this desire for the religious leaders to
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.560]   ensnare and to trap Jesus.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.160]   That's what we're going to see.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.280]   All these different people that come into play on this Tuesday, interestingly enough,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.840]   is not going to be Roman soldiers.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840]   They're not going to be Gentiles or Samaritans.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.160]   It's going to be all different sorts of religious leaders.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.760]   The people who are trying to ensnare Christ were the leaders of the people of God.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.920]   They were the people of Israel.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.120]   They're the Pharisees.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.440]   They're scribes.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.560]   They're these Herodians and Sadducees and priests.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.720]   And the crazy thing is, these Jewish sects were usually at odds with each other.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.920]   There was no unity between these people.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.360]   But they were unifying here on this day with the same goal.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.480]   They didn't simply want to trap Jesus.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.640]   They wanted Jesus dead.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.920]   Jesus knew this.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.960]   He knew that this was on their hearts.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.520]   Jesus knew who these teachers and religious leaders were.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.160]   Jesus wasn't startled into this realization, and they were coming together to kill him.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.520]   It's amazing to see what kind of obstacles can be overcome by the unity of the people
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.560]   of God, right?
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.640]   When we think about what it is for the people of God in the church of God to be unified,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.760]   that overcomes all barriers and obstacles, that come united in a single cause of glorifying
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.360]   God and bringing his kingdom.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.680]   But there's another side too that brings great unity, and that's what we see here today.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.240]   A unity that comes when people, even religious, these people are seemingly morally upright
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.480]   people coming together in their hatred of God.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.640]   Isaiah chapter 29, verse 13.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.160]   I want to direct our attention to this verse because we commonly go to this passage to
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.840]   remember, but today let's take a little extra time to remember that this is the people that
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.160]   were being talked about here in Isaiah many, many years ago.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.840]   It says there, "This people draw near me with their words and honor me with their lip service,
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.080]   but they remove their hearts far from me, and their reverence for me consists of tradition
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.820]   learned by rote."
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.940]   In Psalm chapter 2, there's a Psalm there that describes all these nations that are
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:43.860]   coming together, raging together in their unity of their opposition before God.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.140]   And so you're going to have lots of different types of people, but anyone who is in opposition
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.580]   to God is not only found there in Psalm 2 with all the nations, but you see it very
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.260]   clearly here even in the nation of Israel, the people that were chosen by God.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.620]   These were people who saw Jesus' miracles.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.980]   They saw his might.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.180]   They saw his kindness.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.960]   They saw how compassionate and gracious and loving he was.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.220]   They saw what he was doing and the power that he came in.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.420]   They saw his spirit-filled teaching.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.300]   They were wondering, "Who is this man?"
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.860]   And after seeing all this, they schemed together.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.500]   They turn around and all these different groups of Jewish leaders come together and say, "How
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.220]   can we kill this man?"
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.780]   These are all different groups of people that were looking for some sort of an understanding
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.540]   of God, perhaps waiting for this Messiah for years and years and years.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.740]   And when they finally encounter the man who is systematically fulfilling every single
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.820]   little prophecy that was given in the Old Testament, they come across this man and what
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.380]   happens?
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.420]   How can we kill him?
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.020]   They were studying Scripture day by day.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.940]   When he arrives, they're seething in anger.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.040]   They want him not just set aside, but they want to annihilate him.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.320]   They want him to be dead.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.000]   They actually actively plot not just his death, but they're plotting his murder.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   How can we kill him?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.580]   Do you see the intention there?
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.140]   How can we kill him?
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.180]   They overcome great obstacles and barriers and unify before this Jesus, not to worship
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.600]   and love him, but to kill him.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.340]   And here is this Messiah Jesus who imposes a threat on what they truly want.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.620]   This is a kingdom that they want for themselves.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.020]   This is a world that revolves around them.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.180]   This is a desire to say that, "I want to live on that throne.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.740]   I want to live as God."
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.600]   So on this day of Passion Week, on this Tuesday, this is what is heightening.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:23.040]   They are scheming to get him to that cross, to kill him.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.520]   The people who say, "Lord, Lord," are the very ones who are out to ensnare and murder
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   Christ.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.760]   And again, Jesus knew all of this.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.560]   Think about that.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.840]   Jesus was encountering these people and he knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.280]   Jesus who came down in love to his people, to extend a hand of grace and mercy to his
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.920]   people, to spend an entire earthly lifetime wanting nothing more for them to come to know
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.480]   him, to describe to them that, "I am he you've been waiting for."
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.080]   He's been praying for them.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.320]   He's been teaching them.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.880]   He's been teaching them.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:13.280]   He's been hoping for them to know he's condescended to humanity and their response isn't to surrender.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.840]   Their response isn't love or awe.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.200]   It isn't even neglect or ignorance.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.400]   It is, "How can we kill him?"
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.880]   I'm saying this over and over for a reason because that is what we're moving towards
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.900]   here on this Passion Week.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:35.700]   Because that is the inevitable end of the sinner, that we want to kill him.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:43.320]   And on this Tuesday morning, Jesus and the disciples wake up in Bethany and they head
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.240]   back to Jerusalem and the temple.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.240]   And on the way to Jerusalem, they see the withered tree, the fig tree that we heard
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.200]   about yesterday.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.520]   And they're reminded of what happens to trees that don't produce fruit.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.440]   We can't go into that too much, but that was describing the nation.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.160]   And upon reaching the temple in Jerusalem, this is what it says in Matthew chapter 21
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   verse 23.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160]   We have it written up for you.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.760]   It says, "When Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.840]   came to him while he was teaching."
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.000]   And so Jesus, he sees while he's teaching, inside of the temple, these religious leaders
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.320]   are coming and he knows exactly why they're coming.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.560]   They're ready to ensnare and trap him today on this Tuesday, especially after what he
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.040]   did yesterday.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.920]   Think about what happens.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.520]   Sometimes when you get a good night of sleep, sometimes it helps you to let the emotions
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.920]   subside.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.360]   Sometimes it helps you to rile up even more.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.120]   And they're riled up.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.040]   And they're seeking blood.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:55.680]   Jesus is a great threat to them, to their desires for their worldly kingdom.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.560]   And if God is the means they need to go through to obtain their kingdom, then so be it.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.240]   They want what they want.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.880]   God and his kingdom is not their end here.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.440]   Their own kingdom is their end.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:21.120]   They attach God's name to it, but it's their own kingdom, their own desire and will.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.320]   And you see it immediately in their very first exchange.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   In Matthew chapter 21, verse 23, they ask a question of Jesus and they ask, "By what
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.640]   authority are you doing these things and who gave you this authority?"
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.800]   Now anyone with a mustard seed, just a small amount of faith should be able to look at
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.720]   what Jesus was doing and connect the dots.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.620]   They ought to know by whose authority Jesus comes.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.520]   This is the Messiah.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.240]   But because they don't like the message, because they don't like the fact that when he says
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.400]   he is the king, it is not the type of king they were thinking of, the king that would
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:10.240]   bring about my kingdom, but his.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.480]   The fact that he's saying he is the Lord, he is the master, what happens is they refuse
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.000]   to submit.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   They don't bow the knee.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.680]   And so they ask a question.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.680]   That's not really a question.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.440]   They ask, "By whose authority do you come?"
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.600]   The true answer will never satisfy them.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.680]   So Jesus says to them, "I'm not going to tell you."
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.400]   Why?
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.840]   Because you already know, but you refuse to believe.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.880]   And so he says in Matthew 21, 27, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   things."
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.160]   And this is recognizable to us today because it's always been like this with sinful man.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   Always.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.880]   It's never changed.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:11.400]   God has always been used as a means to the end of the sinful man.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.480]   Rather than submit to his authority, we ask him to bend to my authority.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.840]   So we ask, "By whose authority do you come?"
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.940]   Think of the ridiculousness of that.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:29.560]   As Jesus, the creator, stands before his people, and the people are asking him, "By whose authority
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.880]   do you come?"
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.800]   It's astonishing.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.660]   We understand this because we will pray to God, we will worship God, but only as much
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.360]   as it is to establish my own kingdom.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   The Lord's prayer for us is, "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be my name.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.480]   Make my kingdom come.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   Make my will be done."
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.880]   That's how we actually pray.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.480]   And this is what was happening with the Israelite leaders.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.080]   And Jesus came to show that he had enough of this.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.000]   Before he goes to the cross, this Tuesday is when Jesus makes his clearest rebuke against
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.840]   these leaders.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.680]   Jesus goes into many parables to begin to describe to them in increasing clarity who
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.080]   they are.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.640]   And we'll focus on just two parables.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   Here's the first.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.240]   The vineyard landowner.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.520]   This is the first parable.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.040]   Jesus tells this parable of a vineyard landowner who goes on a journey.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.640]   And before he leaves, he rented it out to people who would keep the land and to pay
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.760]   him his share.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.000]   But what he would do is he would send these slaves to these renters, to these people who
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   are renting the land to collect from the produce that they were gathering from.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.360]   But with every slave he sends to receive some of the produce of his vineyard, it says, "They
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.920]   beat them and they kill them."
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.400]   He says.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.040]   He sends a slave and they beat them and kill them.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.280]   He sends another one and he beats them and kills them.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.120]   He sends another one and he beats them and kills them.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.640]   Slave after slave after slave after slave.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.080]   Kill.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.480]   Stand in awe at the incredible nature of the patience of this landowner.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.200]   It's almost mind-blowing.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.760]   How many slaves are you going to send?
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.120]   He just keeps killing them.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.120]   What do you do?
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.000]   This man's patience is incredible here, right?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.840]   That doesn't end.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.240]   He says, "Maybe if I send my own son, they will listen."
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.080]   This isn't foolishness.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:55.480]   This is incredible patience and love and graciousness, kindness.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.120]   He sends his very own son.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.320]   This means, by the way, that this is the inheritor.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:10.680]   If the landowner is sending his own son, this is the very man who is one day going to inherit
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:20.440]   all of it.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.720]   And a sinful heart is laid bare of these religious leaders.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.920]   Here it is in one statement, the sinful man's heart and intent.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   In verse 38 of chapter 21, they say, they scheme together, all these people, "This
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.560]   is the heir.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.280]   Come, let us kill him."
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.280]   And what?
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.360]   He sees his inheritance.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:54.040]   Jesus is telling them this parable because he knows.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.920]   He knows through and through what's going on in their hearts.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.200]   And when Jesus asked the Jewish leaders what the landowner will do when they kill this
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.960]   son, which they do, they kill the son so that they can have the inheritance, which doesn't
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.200]   even make sense.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:17.360]   It's almost eerie how well the religious leaders are able to answer what the landowner is going
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.240]   to do.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:25.000]   In verse 41, just three verses after, the religious leader said to him, "He, the landowner,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.680]   will bring those wretches to a wretched end and will rent out the vineyard to other vine
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.160]   growers who will pay in the proceeds at the proper season."
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.440]   And then in verse 45, it says, "When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.760]   parables, they understood."
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.040]   They understood that he was talking about them.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.360]   Now, there's many more parables, but here's another one, okay?
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.240]   The wedding feast is the second and last parable we're going to go into.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.840]   Jesus goes on to tell another parable.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.600]   A king holds a wedding feast for his son.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.920]   And so now we've moved from a landowner to what?
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.120]   A king.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.400]   Matthew is all about the kingdom and the king.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.240]   Now we're getting increasing clarity here.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:18.960]   Now the parable's about a king and he's holding a wedding feast for his son.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.040]   And he sends his slaves out to call those who have been invited to the wedding feast.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.300]   But the people are unwilling to come.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.040]   And so again, the king sends other slaves with more information.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.240]   By the way, if you haven't caught on yet, these slaves, these servants that are being
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:38.200]   sent out are alluding to the prophets of old, sent to the nation of Israel.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.000]   And in Matthew chapter 22, verse 4, it says, "Tell those who have been invited, 'Behold,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.560]   I have prepared my dinner.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.260]   My oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.260]   Come to the wedding feast.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.260]   It's to enjoy.'"
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.600]   But without going into the text itself, let me just explain to you.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:01.440]   But those invited pay no attention because they don't care about the king.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.440]   Instead, this is what Jesus says.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.120]   He describes them, okay?
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.360]   He says, "Number one, one owned a farm.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.120]   Number two, one owned a business.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:20.820]   And they said, 'I have this to tend to, so I cannot come.'"
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.100]   And thirdly, anyone else that's remaining, "Seize the slaves," and here it is again,
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.100]   "they killed them."
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:31.380]   Kill.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.140]   They want their own life according to their own terms.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.900]   They don't care about the kingdom of the king.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.100]   They care about their very own kingdom.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.580]   They actually want nothing to do with God, nothing to do with him.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.260]   They want to live their own lives.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:49.660]   And remember that all these things are describing these Jewish leaders, the most religious people
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.660]   in Israel.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:18:00.260]   And he's speaking to them in the temple in Jerusalem.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.060]   But this is what they're willing to do because they honor God with the lips.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.420]   They say with their lips that they love God and they worship God, but they don't really.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.180]   They actually want to live their own lives.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.720]   They want their own kingdom.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.500]   And so when the Messiah comes and he does not say he's going to deliver to them what
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.860]   they want, they turn.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.300]   Do they just turn a blind eye?
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.300]   No.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.860]   They seethe.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.380]   They want him dead.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.620]   That's what's happening on this Tuesday.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:46.980]   But Jesus knows and he's taking painstaking time to explain to them what they are.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:54.060]   You might see all this rebuke, but rebuke done by the sinless man, the son of God.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.980]   And this is love, I think.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.380]   This is grace.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.260]   Showing that this is who you are.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.980]   Do you not see it?
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:12.140]   They say, "Lord, Lord, did we not do all these things in your name?"
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.500]   One day Jesus will stare them back in the eye, unflinching, and say, "I never knew
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.980]   you."
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.340]   The kingdom is reserved for those who love the Lord and live for him.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:28.420]   The kingdom does not house people who live for their own glory.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.420]   And so what is the result?
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:35.580]   The king in this parable sends his armies, destroys the murderers, and sets their city
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.660]   on fire.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.920]   And then the king sends his slaves to the main highways, inviting anyone who would come
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.100]   into the wedding.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.800]   Those previously uninvited.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.660]   The kingdom is reserved for those of faith.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.980]   It does not matter what you look like on the outside.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.820]   The kingdom is for those who have placed their faith in God and give their lives over to
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.820]   God.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.820]   It's for the ones who have traded in all things for the king.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:07.780]   It's not for those who put up a religious show, but it's for those who live for him.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.300]   So he's been teaching all day at this temple, and he concludes, after a full day's work
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.260]   done, Jesus caps it all off, as if there were any question as to the message to stay in
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.460]   Matthew chapter 23.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.500]   Let me read to us verse 2-7.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.460]   The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.260]   Remember all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.100]   For they say things and do not do them.
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.700]   They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.140]   to move them with so much as a finger.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.540]   But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.660]   For they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.300]   They love the places of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues, and
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.900]   respectful greetings in the marketplaces, and being called rabbi by men.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.980]   And when I hear these words of Jesus, all I can hear is, "Their kingdom, their kingdom,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.860]   their kingdom."
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.260]   That's all I can hear in that.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.100]   And so what he does is pronounces, "Woe!" which is an exclamation of grief.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.620]   And you can think of it like this, "Woe!"s mean how greatly one will suffer.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.140]   When he says, pronounces a "Woe!" is what terrible pain will come.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.700]   It means how horrible it will be.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.020]   And he says, "Woe to the scribes and Pharisees."
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.820]   He says it seven times.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.540]   "Woe!" in verse 13.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.700]   "Woe to the scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.700]   In verse 14.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.540]   "Woe to the scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.540]   In verse 15.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.260]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.260]   Verse 16.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.260]   "Woe to you, blind guides!"
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.260]   Verse 23.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.020]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.020]   Verse 25.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.020]   Verse 27.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.020]   Verse 29.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.020]   Verbatim.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.020]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.300]   He's saying how horrible it will be for you.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.740]   The judgment is being stored, and Jesus is making it clear that the proud and arrogant,
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.100]   you are not victims.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.060]   This will be just recompense for your sin.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.620]   They are hard-hearted people who are bringing judgment upon themselves.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.220]   He has spent this time exposing who they are and what their heart is like.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.420]   They have proud and arrogant hearts that do not submit to Jesus as he's saying this, Jesus
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:15.000]   is standing before them, preaching his heart out, filled with desire.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.720]   The King that has come, and all they want is for Jesus to fit their own agenda.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.220]   And now, because he does not fulfill that, they want to eliminate the threat, and so
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.700]   they go and scheme.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.540]   It is intentional.
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.460]   God has been patient in his desire to extend his grace and mercy for years and years and
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.860]   years.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.580]   And so in verse 34, he says, "Therefore," this is right after all the woes, "Woe, woe,
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:49.820]   woe, woe, woe to all of you," he says, "Therefore, therefore," the only therefore in this whole
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.820]   passage, okay?
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:57.420]   He says, "Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men, scribes, some of
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.460]   them you will kill and crucify, some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.300]   from city to city, so that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous bloodshed on
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.500]   earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah."
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.820]   The Jewish Bible started with Genesis, ended with 2 Chronicles, and these were the front
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:20.380]   and the end, the bookends of prophets that were given, that you will kill them all.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.220]   In verse 37, he cries out, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   are sent to her?
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.240]   How often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.700]   under her wings, and you were unwilling.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.100]   Behold, your house is being left to you desolate."
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.820]   See, Jesus' heart is filled here.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.940]   He's not mean.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.500]   He's incredibly sad.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.780]   He is angry.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:58.300]   So on the way home, back to Bethany on this Tuesday, they stop by the Mount of Olives.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:04.060]   They go up, and it's a place as the sun is going down where they could look out across
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.060]   the whole city.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.500]   They can see it, and Jesus begins to go into the Olivet Discourse.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.060]   If you're unfamiliar with that, it's where he starts talking about the end and what it
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.060]   will look like.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:22.860]   Jesus describes the persecution, the tribulation, the judgment that happened not only to the
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:30.420]   prophets of old, but to those who will continue, the people of the kingdom, that those who
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:36.620]   are willing to kill God will most definitely kill his servants, and God's ultimate judgment
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.700]   is coming, and he warns them.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:44.580]   It is being reserved, but it is only for a time, and right now is still a time of grace.
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.120]   He warns them because he loves them, and he warns them, and he sends them out with this
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:57.460]   warning so that the church can deliver this.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.700]   Right now is still a time of grace, but the call is still to seek the Lord while he may
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:06.580]   be found, and that is why we can celebrate Passion Week, Good Friday, Resurrection Sunday,
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:14.940]   every single year because we are still existing in a time of God's patient grace.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.020]   If you have friends and family who do not know Christ, bring them.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.020]   Bring them on Friday.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.440]   Bring them on Sunday, that they might come to know him.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.100]   Would you take a moment now to pray?
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:31.620]   We're going to just give you maybe three or four minutes or so to pray, thinking about
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:39.260]   Jesus standing before these religious leaders, and take the time to see how closely our hearts
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:48.220]   resemble and mimic these religious leaders, to confess our sins, to repent of our selfish
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.980]   and self-centered ways, and to see it as more as flaws or wayward living, but see it as
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:26:01.120]   what it is, a desire for the elimination of God in our lives.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.460]   Our repentance needs to match what our sin actually is.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.260]   Take this time to pray.
