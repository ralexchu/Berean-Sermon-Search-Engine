[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans Chapter 14, 1-4.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.560]   We're jumping back into the series in Romans.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.840]   Romans Chapter 14, 1-4.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.360]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.740]   As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions.
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.720]   One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.640]   Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.280]   pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.820]   Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another?
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.700]   It is before his own master that he stands or falls, and he will be upheld for the Lord
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.040]   is able to make him stand.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.680]   Let's pray.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.520]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.680]   We thank you for your living word, we thank you for your patience.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.600]   We thank you for the fellowship that we have with brothers and sisters, Lord God in Christ.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.400]   And we know what a blessing it is, Lord, to be a part of your body.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.960]   Help us to hear from you, not from man, not from man's thinking, not from man's study,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.920]   but you, Father God, that you would ordain your words and that your sheep will hear your
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.480]   voice and follow you.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.080]   May your name be blessed.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   May our time, Lord God, would be an encouragement.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   You know, as you guys know, yesterday we had our annual softball tournament.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.000]   I'm not sure if it was our 12th year or 13th year, and congratulations to our Brian Sisters
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.240]   A-Team, they won again.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.600]   Let's give them a hand, okay?
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.160]   So this is their third year winning the championship, and some of the ladies were limping around
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.520]   the church, you know, that they played yesterday.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.440]   And so, again, it's always fun watching them and spending the whole Saturday, you know,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.520]   just yelling and screaming and cheering on our sisters.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.640]   And in particular, I had a lot of fun with our B-Team.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.560]   You know, when we say B-Team, we normally say it's the fun team, so there's absolutely
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.120]   no expectation.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.320]   And so we went in there, again, with no expectation, but I would say the B-Team this year was probably
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.280]   the best B-Team we've ever had, okay?
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.680]   And this is objective science, this is not just my opinion.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.240]   They played their hearts out, and especially this year, we had, you know, intergenerational
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240]   teammates.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.560]   We had two mothers with two daughters playing on the same team, and it was really heartwarming
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.200]   to participate and see that.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.680]   And we could tell every game they were actually improving.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.120]   And so by the time we got to the third game, they were actually hitting and running bases
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.080]   and getting legitimate scores.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.200]   And in my mind, if we did this another couple years, we might be able to win a game, maybe
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.640]   one day.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.800]   But it was fun either way, you know?
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.280]   I spent the whole Saturday, came back, and again, every year I look forward to it because
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.120]   not simply because of the softball, win or lose, it's an opportunity to spend time with
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.680]   our brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.360]   And let me read a passage from you in Psalm chapter 133.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.520]   It says, "Behold how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.360]   It is like the precious oil on the head running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron running
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.360]   down on the collar of his robes.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.320]   It is like the dew of Hermon which falls on the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.520]   has commanded the blessing, life forevermore."
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.240]   And so in Psalm 33 is a description of God's community and how God gives it to his people
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.040]   as a blessing, not only for themselves but to share it with one another.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.760]   And what a blessing it is that we have to be able to run this race together with fellow
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.320]   brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.200]   And so, you know, during softball, we get to spend a lot of time just getting to know
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.160]   people that we didn't know before.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.240]   A lot of people are a certain way outside of the softball, but you can really see their
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.720]   personalities when they get into competition.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.320]   And so you feel like it's kind of a good way to break ice and to get to know people.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.280]   Why I share all of this is, you know, probably one of the greatest gifts that God has given
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.320]   Christians is the church.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.720]   That we have a community of people that we can run this race together with, share our
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.200]   suffering, celebrate our weddings, to pray together in our difficulties.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   And so it's an awesome gift that God has given the church.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.800]   But when the church turns sour, it's also the greatest source of stumbling.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   It's the greatest source of agony, oftentimes, it's also within the church.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.920]   So typically what happens, if we're not careful, is the greatest excitement of the church happens
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.120]   early part of the church, when the church is planted.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.960]   And there's excitement, there's this vision, and everybody's sacrificing for one another.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.080]   And it's kind of like taking a short-term trip out to Mission Field, and that's what
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.640]   the church feels like early on in the church.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.840]   But after about two, three, four, five, six, seven years have passed, and all the different
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.120]   personalities begin to arise, and the pressures of the church, and all these things, and after
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.800]   a while what happens is that the fellowship of the church just becomes a place where you
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.520]   tolerate people.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.640]   You're not going to abandon it, because it's clearly stated in Scripture for us to be together,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.680]   and this is the church that Christ loves.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.480]   But it no longer has that feel like, "I want to be there because I want to get to know
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.040]   people and I want to share my life with people."
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.120]   It's more of, "I have these three people over here, but I don't like these four people here,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.920]   and these people I want to spend my life with, and those people I hope I don't get put into
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   the same small group."
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.280]   And we have all of these things happen, and after a while, the longer you've been at a
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.240]   church, the more we have to fight through tolerating certain people in the church.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.440]   And sad to say, that's the state that once you get to, you remain for the rest of your
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.960]   life.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.320]   And then so, you remember, you talk about what it was like at one point a long time
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.000]   ago, but it's no longer your experience.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.520]   There's a reason why Paul says, "In view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies a living
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   sacrifice."
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.960]   And again, the application of that in chapter 12 and 13, he was describing what biblical
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.000]   love looks like.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.600]   Because the primary application of what God has done for us is to practice this love.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.000]   As much as he loved us, he said, "Now practice this love with God and with one another."
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.840]   So that's what he's been expositing in chapter 12, chapter 12, 13.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.440]   And in chapter 14 and 15, Paul's going to deal with something very specific.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.680]   Because love is easy to talk about when it's in theory, when we're singing about it, when
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.200]   we're expositing and talking and memorizing scripture.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.040]   But where the rubber meets the road, we're actually rubbing shoulders with people and
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.440]   sharing lives and doing work together.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.200]   You know, eventually, you're going to rub people the wrong way and things begin to come
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.600]   up, personalities come up.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.440]   And so Paul is going to take us to a very practical issue that came up in the early
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   church.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.000]   And it wasn't just in the book of Romans.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.160]   If you look at scripture, you'll find out that this is splattered all throughout the
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   New Testament.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:40.220]   In fact, one of the greatest things that is dealt with in the New Testament is about the
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.640]   unity in the early church, how to practice this love.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.120]   So Paul is going to take us to a particular problem that the early church had that was,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.800]   again, universal in almost all the early churches.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.200]   And we're going to look at some principles that he's going to teach us through this.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.840]   So the four things that we're going to look at this morning is, what specifically was
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.040]   the problem?
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.400]   Secondly, who were involved with this problem?
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   That's the second one.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.920]   The third one, how were they to deal with this problem?
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.720]   And then the fourth, why was it necessary to deal with this problem?
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.400]   So that's the outline for today's message in verses one through four.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.800]   So let's look at the first one.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.300]   What was the specific problem that Paul is dealing with?
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.920]   In verses, chapter 14, two to five, he describes it this way.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.880]   He says, "One person believes that he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.880]   vegetables."
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.460]   And then verse five, "One person esteems one day as better than another, while another
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.600]   esteems all days alike."
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.400]   So you had this tension between, are they allowed to eat this, eat meat, or not?
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.920]   Is the Sabbath going to be on Saturday or on Sunday?
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.920]   And this was a big issue.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.440]   Now, we may look at that and say, you know, we're 2,000 years removed from this problem.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.360]   It's not a practical problem that we have today.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.100]   We don't sit around talking about, like, should we eat meat or not eat meat?
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.760]   We just eat meat.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.160]   You know, universally, we accept that Sunday's a time that we worship.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.520]   But if you look beyond what's happening, I think you'll see how practical this issue
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.080]   really is, and how it could have easily torn the church apart in the early church if they
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.760]   didn't deal with it in a manner that Paul is calling them to.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.400]   Think about what the early church was made of.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.040]   You had former tax collectors with former fishermen, and by nature, they would have
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.560]   been at odds with one another.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.500]   You had former slave owners and slaves, runaway slaves in the same church.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.000]   You had the Pharisees, and then you had the sinners and the prostitutes, all in the same
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.200]   church.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.580]   You had the Greeks.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.720]   You had the Jews.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.120]   I mean, humanly speaking, there's no way that this group, this early church, should have
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:03.360]   made it, because outside of Christ, they had absolutely no reason to be together.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.720]   The beauty of the church, even in this room, you know, even in this room, there's enough
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.820]   diversity in this room that there's probably people who are sitting around you that you
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.200]   may think to yourself that even if I wasn't a Christian, I could see myself being friends
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.360]   with this guy or this girl.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.320]   And then there's people sitting next to you that you never said that to them, but you
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.600]   probably think to yourself, "If I wasn't a Christian, there's no way that our lives would
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.200]   ever intersect.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.020]   We just are just too different."
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:38.000]   We have people in various ages, various races, various economic backgrounds, personalities,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.160]   hobbies.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.200]   How can you possibly get anything done in the church with a church that is volunteering?
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.960]   I can understand in a work environment where you're paying people and they're forced to
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.980]   do it whether they like it or not, but how do you get a church of hundreds of people
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:59.060]   with different personalities, different perspective, to all agree on anything?
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.200]   But the beauty of the church is that God has placed the diversity together in the church
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.280]   to worship and to supplement, to encourage one another.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.360]   If we do not handle, if we do not behave, if we do not practice the practical things
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:21.540]   that are taught in this text, the very nature of the church, humanly speaking, will eventually
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.540]   break up.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.560]   So we're surprised, you know, when a church gets together and then after 10 years or 20
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.440]   years, they split up and they go their own ways.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.560]   Oh, how could they possibly happen?
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.400]   Humanly speaking, why didn't that happen earlier considering the makeup of the church?
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.440]   How can these people who are so diverse, so different, in every aspect, stay together
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.900]   for that long doing something that is important as spreading the gospel?
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.520]   Why did God use this system?
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.840]   Why does he put us together?
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.760]   Think about our society.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:01.160]   You know, up to high school, you're forced to be around all different kinds of people.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.480]   Whether you are a computer guy or you're a jock, whether you are a scientist or you're
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.640]   an entrepreneur, you know, we're all together and you have all kinds of diversity in high
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.640]   school.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.960]   But by the time you get to college, depending on your major, you get separated into different
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.080]   schools.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.960]   But even within the schools, you have different majors.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.100]   You have art majors and you have science majors.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.000]   And so you have friends, but in your major, you spend bulk of your time with people who
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   are similar to you.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.520]   And then by the time you graduate and you get a job, all the salesmen are on this side
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.200]   of the world and all the, you know, all the engineers on this side of the world and all
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.000]   the doctors are on that side of the world.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.820]   And so you end up spending majority of your time with people who are just like you.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.800]   That's just the world that we live in.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.640]   And the older you get, the more you live in this world, the more segregated you become
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.320]   from people who are different than you.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.560]   That's true even with your family members.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.640]   You know, when you're younger, you spend a lot of time because you're connected to your
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.680]   parents, but as you get older, if you have different opinions, different views, different
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.600]   jobs, you don't get to spend a lot of time with them.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:16.660]   So how does a church with all this diversity, with all different opinions, come together
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.520]   and stay united?
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.680]   You raise your children differently.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.280]   You have different thoughts of what is important and what is not important.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.000]   If we had $100 and asked all of you, "How should we spend the $100?"
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.600]   We'll have 100 different opinions.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.320]   How does a church with this much diversity stay together?
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.360]   In fact, this was probably one of the biggest concerns of the early church.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.000]   And that's why in 1 Corinthians 1, 10 through 11, it says, "I appeal to you, brothers, by
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.160]   the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no divisions
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.680]   among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment."
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.560]   He's saying this to the Corinthians church because he was concerned about the division
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.600]   in the church, how they value one person over another, and that was causing all kinds of
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.600]   division.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:11.000]   And this division was the epicenter of why sexual immorality, why there's chaos in worship,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.680]   why even in communion, even the use of spiritual gifts, all was practice in chaos, was causing
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.840]   all kinds of erosion in the church.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   But the root of it was division in the church.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.480]   And it wasn't just the Corinthians.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.360]   In Ephesians 4, 3-6, it says, "Eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.920]   there is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920]   to your call.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.320]   One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God, the Father of all, who is over all and through
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.560]   all and in all."
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:45.000]   And the reason why he keeps saying all, all, one God, one baptism, one Spirit, is because
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.080]   the Jews and the Gentiles were in the same church.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:56.200]   They spent hundreds of years hating each other, accusing each other of being arrogant, accusing
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.640]   each other of being unclean.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.560]   And all of a sudden, they're together.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.860]   And so there was this concern that because we're brought together because of the love
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.600]   of Christ, but there's this constant friction.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.200]   In fact, the first problem that the church had was this conflict between the Hellenist
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:20.320]   Greeks, Hellenist Jews, Hellenist widows versus the Jews.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.800]   And they were being neglected in the daily distribution of food, so these widows weren't
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   being fed.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.560]   And if they didn't handle this correctly, it could have completely divided the church.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.920]   And this was a constant concern of the early church.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:37.760]   In fact, in Jesus's prayer in John 17, 20-21, the priestly prayer, the core part of his
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.320]   prayer is also about unity.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:47.160]   He says, "I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.920]   their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me."
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.360]   So at the core of Jesus's prayer for his people is unity.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.160]   And again, in chapter 12, verse 16, it says, "Live in harmony with one another.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.600]   Never be conceited."
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.240]   So this was not a problem with one church.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:22.640]   I mean, just humanly thinking, if you have that kind of diversity in the church, you
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.000]   would automatically assume there was going to be all kinds of conflict.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.760]   And that's exactly what they were concerned about.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.840]   But the beauty of the church is often like the marriage.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:43.040]   After doing marriage counseling and officiating weddings, and I don't know exactly how many,
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.880]   it's close to 100 different weddings that I've participated in, and I can honestly say
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.040]   I can only think about maybe two or three couples that I say, "Wow, these people are
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.260]   exactly alike.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.320]   Their temperament is alike.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.080]   The way they view the world is alike."
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   I would say 98%, right, or more than 90% of the people that I counsel, these two people
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.160]   are as night and day.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.040]   One person is an introvert, the other person is an extrovert.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.280]   One person is tedious in planning, the other person just kind of is spontaneous.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.600]   And so there's natural reasons why there would be conflict.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:26.920]   And where it first shows is in the preparation for the marriage, the wedding itself.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.240]   Because they're planning, they're spending money, they're making big decisions, and all
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.120]   of a sudden they're realizing, it's like, "Wow, we're very different."
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.880]   But the beauty of the marriage is that these two people were very different, and I believe
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:45.800]   that it may be God-designed, because God intended husband and wife to be a complement to each
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   other.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.140]   That the wife is good at things that the husband is not, and the husband is good at things
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:55.600]   that the wife is not, and them coming together makes them better.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.960]   To the beauty of the church is very similar.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.200]   If we look at the cross, I have my view of what the cross looks like, but the beauty
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.080]   of the church is, all of you have different perspective, because of your life experience,
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.680]   your personalities, your temperament.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.560]   So you're able to see the cross in a different light.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.000]   I see it this way, you see it from this point.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.560]   It's kind of like having different spotlights on the cross.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.280]   Every time you hear a testimony of a believer, they're giving you their angle.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.120]   I've been showing you this, and then another person's testimony is showing you this, another
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.720]   person is spotting the light from the top, another from the side.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.960]   And all of this adds to the beauty of the cross.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   But the headache that also comes along about being married is that a lot of times, after
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.800]   you've been married, the very things that you are attracted to, the very things that
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:53.040]   cause you to want to be with that other person, when something goes wrong in the marriage,
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.880]   all you see are things that you don't like.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.840]   Why is she this way?
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.480]   Why is he that way?
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.800]   A lot of times, ladies are attracted to strong, silent types.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:14.160]   Then after the honeymoon period is over, the main complaint is, this guy never talks.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.920]   I thought he was strong and silent, I realized he's just silent.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.240]   You're attracted to somebody who's outgoing personality, and they like to do things spontaneously.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.520]   I love that about this person because they kind of make me want to do things that I didn't
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   do before.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   I would never do these things.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.080]   Then after the honeymoon is over, it's like, man, this person is so reckless.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.360]   They never plan for anything.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.680]   How can they possibly survive?
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.520]   So the very things that attracted you in the beginning, once the honeymoon period is over,
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.960]   and you forget why you got together, the very things that made your relationship beautiful,
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.000]   it becomes a source of stumbling for you.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.560]   And that's no different in the church.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.600]   The glue that holds all of this together is the love of Christ.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:10.280]   And when the love of Christ, when the shining upon the cross becomes a side issue, and anything
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.880]   else takes center stage, all of a sudden, all these people that I would have never,
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.200]   ever spent time with becomes the main source of stumbling in the church.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.120]   See, the early church, that was the problem.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:27.320]   You had people from various backgrounds trying to come together, and if they didn't practice
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   love the way scripture teaches, all of a sudden it's like, Gentile.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.760]   I have to go into a Gentile home?
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.040]   I have to eat with these people?
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:43.000]   I'm giving my offering and that's what, they're going to go and help those people?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.360]   So that was the early church.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.720]   It's no different today.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.680]   Maybe the application may look different, but humanly speaking, this is not supposed
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.600]   to work, right?
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.720]   Because you're not getting paid to do this.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.960]   You're volunteering to do this.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:05.120]   So if we're not careful, we're always in the area, we're one problem or one frustration
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.560]   away from just packing it up and saying, "I'm done with this."
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:14.160]   That was a problem, but I think it'll help us to understand the real issue, and again,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.560]   for application, when we realize who these people were, that's number two.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.720]   Paul calls these two groups of people that were having conflict as one being weak and
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.400]   the other being strong.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.720]   Now by saying that, we can already tell where Paul stands.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   Paul himself in chapter 15, one says, "We who are strong."
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.080]   So he relates himself with the people who are able to eat, who's not making a big deal
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.760]   about the Sabbath, and he calls the other group the weak brother.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.440]   So by saying that, we can automatically think, "Then why didn't Paul just step in and say,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.200]   'Hey, you weak brothers, you're wrong.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   It's unbiblical.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.000]   You need to stop.'"
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.880]   Why does he even try to reconcile and saying, "Do not judge them and get along."
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:02.920]   You have to understand, Paul is not, when he's calling these people weak, he's not saying
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.320]   that they are morally weak.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.120]   He's not saying that they weren't strong Christians.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.800]   He is simply stating that they were in the period of transitioning from the old and the
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.840]   new covenant, and they need to be patient with them in that period of transition.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.960]   Now there's two groups of people who would have had issue, in particular with the eating
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   aspect.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:33.880]   1 Corinthians chapter 8 deals with a group of people who used to be idol worshippers.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.040]   And so they converted and they became Christians.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.120]   They were in the church, but all the meat that they were eating was coming from the
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.480]   temple where it was offered up to their idol, and then afterwards it was being sold in the
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.660]   marketplace.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.080]   So what happened was, when they were eating meat, they were relating the meat eating with
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   idol worship.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.560]   So it wasn't simply that you had a group of people who were just going, "You know what?
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.560]   I don't care.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   There's no rules.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.560]   God loves us anyway.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   We're going to do whatever we want."
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.760]   Their core motivation wasn't idolatry.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.320]   It wasn't licentiousness.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.960]   It was their intent to stay pure.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.560]   I think the best way for me to describe this in modern terms is, there are some people,
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:21.320]   even in this room, who came from a family background where either a father or mother
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.000]   or both maybe had abuse in alcohol.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.680]   And as a result of that, your conscience is a lot more sensitive than other people.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.960]   So just a mention of alcohol causes you to say, "That's wrong."
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.520]   Just mention of it.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.720]   And anybody even brings up the subject, it's like, "I'm never going to go to a church where
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   they're going to touch alcohol."
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.400]   Because they came from a background where it was being abused.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:52.880]   Understandably, for that person, because of their experience and their background, they're
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.760]   hypersensitive to the issue of alcohol.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.400]   And then we have some people who grew up in homes where they had godly parents, and they
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.560]   would have meals, and wine was a part of their meal.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   And it was nothing.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.200]   It was part of the meal.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:12.520]   So they come to a church, and even the issue of alcohol is strange to them.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.720]   And they probably never heard of this issue until they came to church, and other people
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.320]   were bothered by it.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.720]   See, these people who were having this issue with meat, at least the first group of people,
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.280]   it was just bothering their conscience because that was their background.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   And they related meat-eating with idol worship.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.480]   So in the church, he's not talking about just people who are just going out, "You know what?
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.400]   I just want to drink and do whatever I want," and just completely insensitive to the conscience
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   of other people because of their background.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400]   And it's immature.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:50.520]   You know, a lot of people misuse this text and other texts to think, "Well, if you're
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:56.080]   strong, you can drink whatever we want, whenever we want, in front of whoever we want because
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.360]   we're the strong."
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.360]   That's not what he's referring to.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.800]   To me, that's immaturity because that's a revelation of selfishness.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   You're not thinking about the context.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.320]   You're not thinking about other people.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.640]   See, that's what Paul is referring to in this text, the first group of people who are having
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.200]   issues because of their conscience, of their background.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.120]   But the second group of people is probably more prevalent in the early church, who were
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.040]   the converted Jews.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.000]   Who were the people who probably had the hardest time making that transition into the Old and
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.080]   the New Covenant?
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.560]   Think carefully about who do you think would have had the hardest time transitioning from
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.640]   the Old and the New Covenant for the Jews?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.200]   Probably the ones who were the most faithful to the Old Covenant.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.360]   You know, we've been studying through the book of Leviticus and how meticulous God was
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.480]   in teaching us about unclean food.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.480]   How do you become unclean?
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.840]   How do you become clean?
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.000]   And so if you were a faithful Jew, you kept that tediously, every part of it.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.800]   So the ones who were the most faithful to the law, they were the ones who were probably
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.040]   having the hardest time because Paul says all of that is fulfilled in Christ.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.880]   Now this thing that they couldn't touch for hundreds of years, all of a sudden now they're
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.480]   not only touching it, they're eating it.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.400]   They're breaking bread with other people, sitting with other Gentiles.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.280]   All this time they thought they were unclean, so they were having a hard time transitioning.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.240]   He's not talking about a group of people who are just going out and just having fun doing
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.440]   whatever they want.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.320]   You want to know who would have had the easiest time accepting the New Covenant?
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.920]   Probably the unfaithful Jews.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.080]   They didn't take the law seriously anyway.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.640]   You know, they were probably traveling and going to Gentile worlds and there's no accountability,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.040]   so they're just eating pork.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   This is delicious.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.480]   I don't know why God says this is unclean.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   I feel so clean when I eat it.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.680]   You know, and then all of a sudden Paul says all of that is fulfilled in Christ.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.360]   It's like, yes!
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:08.000]   Those weak brothers, they should have some pork and become strong, right?
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.520]   They would have maybe, superficially, had the easiest time transitioning into the New
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.960]   Covenant, but that's not who he's referring to.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.320]   And sometimes that happens a lot even in the church.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.880]   They misinterpret Scripture and they say, "Well, we're going to drink, you know, because
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.880]   we're strong.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.760]   We're going to do whatever we want because we're strong.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.720]   Our conscience is clear.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.000]   And all it is is a revelation of your licentiousness."
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.080]   That's who he's dealing with.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:39.880]   He's not dealing with people who are trying to live ungodly lives and making excuses.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.520]   In fact, Romans chapter 14, 6, it says, "The one who observes the day observes it in honor
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.960]   of the Lord.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.800]   The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord since he gives thanks to God, while the one
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.480]   who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and give thanks to God."
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.380]   He's saying in both parties, their intent is to honor God.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.440]   Their intent is to glorify God, not to make excuses.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.760]   "Oh, Christian liberty, we're going to do whatever we want."
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.720]   He's not talking about that problem.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.520]   That's a clear problem of mature and immature, but that's not what we're dealing with here.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:19.840]   In fact, the hardest thing to reconcile in the church are two groups of people who are
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:25.040]   trying to live righteously, but they're not on the same page.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.360]   That's who he's dealing with, the weak and the strong.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:32.560]   So the weak he's referring to is not talking about somebody who is just living in idolatry,
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.640]   the strong are not the people who've been living for so long and disciplined and know
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.640]   all the scripture.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.000]   He's just talking about strong as in somebody who's transitioned from the old covenant to
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   the new.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.160]   Weak brothers are taking a bit longer to get there.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.760]   That's who he's referring to.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.960]   Knowing that's the problem, knowing that these are the people who are involved in this conflict,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.120]   and if they didn't deal with this well, can you imagine?
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.560]   If they didn't handle this well, it would have easily just split the church between
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.480]   those who are going to eat, those who aren't going to eat.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.400]   And they would have been justified, at least in their mind, because they're biblical.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.680]   One side wants to honor and glorify God, and they can't touch the meat.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.840]   The other side is saying, "We're going to honor God, so we're going to touch the meat."
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.120]   And so they would have easily had to separate.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.580]   So it is in that context he writes this, and he says, "This is what you ought to do."
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.660]   So number three, how are they to deal with this problem?
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:33.160]   First of all, he says, "We are not to despise or pass judgment on disputable matters and
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.760]   opinions."
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.400]   Verse one.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.760]   In the NIV, it says, "Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.200]   matters."
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.920]   He's not saying, "Don't make judgments of any kind."
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.520]   The scripture clearly says, 1 Corinthians 5, 12, 13, "For what have I to do with judging
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.520]   outsiders?
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.400]   Do I have those inside the church whom we are to judge?
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   God judges those outside.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.840]   Purge the evil person from among you."
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.800]   John 7, 23, "Do not judge by appearance, but judge with right judgment."
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.120]   Don't misunderstand and think, "Therefore," what he is saying is, "We should never say
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.640]   anything bad.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.560]   We should never determine anything good or bad.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.560]   We should never have any opinions about anything."
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.920]   That's not what he's saying at all.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:24.920]   He says, "When it comes to matters that are not essential, do not raise the bar."
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:31.840]   If we're not careful, especially when we're younger, if we're not careful, every issue
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.120]   becomes Martin Luther standing before the Catholic Church.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.960]   "Here I stand, and I can do no other."
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.240]   "Here I stand, and I can do no other."
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.360]   So when you have two people who are, "Here we stand, we can do no other," and they can't
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:51.480]   reconcile, and it's almost like there's a Reformation every two months.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.000]   Everybody is like, "Reformation!
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   We have to!
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.200]   It has to be this way!"
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.120]   So he's talking about there are appropriate times when Reformation may need to take place,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:06.560]   but he says, "When it comes to non-essentials, on disputable matters, on the things of opinion,"
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.600]   he says, "Do not be strong.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   Do not oppose.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.440]   Do not judge."
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.960]   That's the first principle that he gives us.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.200]   It doesn't mean that we don't have opinions on non-essentials.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.760]   We all do.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.520]   If I ask you what your thoughts on drinking is, I'll probably get all different kinds
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.440]   of views on this.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.960]   On what you should do on Sunday, what you can and cannot do on Sunday, how you should
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.960]   spend your life, where you spend your money, what kind of house you buy.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.640]   Everybody has opinions about something.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.760]   How should we dress on Sunday?
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.760]   What should I say?
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.760]   What should I not say?
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.040]   We all have opinions.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.960]   He's not saying don't have opinions.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.880]   He's saying don't be divided over these opinions.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.800]   Don't make every opinion into a Martin Luther King moment.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.000]   Not King, Martin Luther moment.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.360]   I don't know why I said King.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   I meant King Jesus.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   That's what I meant.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:07.440]   But secondly, he says we are called to accept and welcome one another.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.640]   To accept and welcome one another.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.000]   When we read that in English, it just sounds like, "Welcome them," or "Accept them,"
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.240]   "Tolerate them."
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.080]   That word for accepting the Greek is far beyond that word just to tolerate.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:26.280]   Because, again, if we're not careful, initially we get together as a church, and that honeymoon
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.800]   period of, "Yeah, we're going to do this, and we're sacrificing, and we just love the
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.600]   fellowship of the church."
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.360]   I remember earlier part of our church, we were known as the loiterers.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   Some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.320]   We were known as the loiterers because whenever we got together, nobody went home, ever.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.520]   Almost to the point where their parents probably would have gotten concerned.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:55.720]   We actually went to another church to prep for mission work, and then their church locked
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.160]   up and went home, and we were still at their church.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.920]   They asked us, "Can you lock up when you go home?"
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.880]   Those of you guys who've been here a long time, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.960]   Our church was Berean loitering church because we would get together, and we would never
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   go home.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.680]   Part of the reason why is because everybody just loved each other's company.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.680]   We wanted to be together.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.560]   It had nothing to do with being extrovert or introvert.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.400]   We just loved being together.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:28.160]   But again, the danger, and if we're not careful, we get to a point where all we're doing is
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.480]   just tolerating each other.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:37.880]   We're tolerating ... At a church our size, you can avoid certain people if you want.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.080]   I don't mind having Sunday worship together, but don't put me in their small group.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.400]   You never say it out loud.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.800]   I just get emails.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.880]   People who aren't laughing are the ones who sent it.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.160]   I say that because it is that common.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.960]   We can get into a church, and it's not just a few.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.160]   It's all of us.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.280]   All of us can get to a point, once the honeymoon is over, and say, "You know what?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.400]   I'm okay with these people.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.400]   These people I love.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.760]   These people I'm okay with.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.760]   These people I tolerate."
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.880]   And they'll say, "Well, these people I hate."
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.960]   You're not going to say that because you're Christian.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.640]   It's just to accept.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.760]   The word for accept here is a much deeper and broader word than what we would think
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   in English.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.120]   John Stott, I'm just going to read this to you, he explains about this word.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.920]   He says, "Accept means more than to accept people in the sense of acquiescing in their
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.680]   existence, even in their right to belong, more even than to receive or accept in one's
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.840]   society, in one's home or circle of acquaintance.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.720]   It means to welcome into one's fellowship and into one's heart.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.480]   It implies the warmth and kindness of genuine love.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.600]   Thus it is used in the New Testament of Philemon giving to Onesimus the same welcome that he
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.560]   would give to the apostle."
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.440]   It's not just putting up together.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:07.720]   Like, "I'll tolerate these people because I'm a Christian."
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.000]   The scripture says that we are identified as Christians because we practice the love
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.480]   Jesus practiced on us.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.160]   Not simply, he didn't just tolerate us, he didn't just allow us to come to church.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.440]   He sacrificed his only begotten son and he adopted us.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.200]   And now he calls us to enter his gates with thanksgiving.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   He wants us to come.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.480]   "Well, you don't know what I've done this week."
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.260]   That's why Jesus came.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:36.400]   We have the communion table to remind us that it's not by your righteousness but by his
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   grace, by his blood.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.040]   He didn't just tolerate us.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:48.480]   He covered us, washed us with his blood to make us his own children.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:56.120]   He calls us, again, on the non-essentials to learn to be gracious with one another and
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:01.080]   to actually go further than that and to pursue love with one another.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.960]   That's what the word "accept" means.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.640]   Why is this so important?
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.400]   Why does he tell us that this is something that we must do?
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.040]   Simply because that's what he did for us.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.560]   In Romans 15, he makes it clear, "Therefore, welcome one another as Christ has welcomed
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.520]   you for the glory of God."
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.320]   He welcomed us.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.360]   That word "welcome" here is the same word "welcome" here, "accept," because he loved
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.360]   us first.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.760]   He pursued us.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:37.720]   In fact, again, as John Stott mentions this word, Philemon 12.17, Paul says to the former
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:43.480]   slave owner, "I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart."
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.800]   He says he's not just saying, "You know what?
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   You need to reconcile.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.120]   You need to forgive him."
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.840]   He says, "No, I'm sending my very heart."
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.560]   Paul is writing this letter as an apostle with the full authority that he has.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.880]   He says, "I can easily command you to do this.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.640]   I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.480]   Your salvation came because I preached the gospel to you, so I can command this to you.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.360]   But I'm not going to command this to you because I want you to practice the grace that God
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.480]   practiced with us.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.840]   And I'm going to give you an opportunity to love him as we've been loved by the blood
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   of Christ."
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.560]   And so he says, "What I'm sending to you, he's not just an ex-slave.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.920]   He's not just a Christian.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.040]   He's my very heart that I'm sending to you."
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.880]   And he says, "So if you consider me your partner, receive him."
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.400]   That same word.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   Same word Paul uses here in chapter 14.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.000]   "Receive him as you would receive me."
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.480]   That's the idea.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   That when you receive him, you're receiving Paul.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.880]   When you receive Paul, you're receiving who?
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.440]   Jesus.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.240]   Welcome him and love him as you would love Christ.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.680]   Remember Luke chapter 15?
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.640]   When Jesus was being rebuked by the Pharisees, "Why are you hanging around?
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.400]   Why are you tolerating these sinners?"
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.280]   Jesus turns the table on them and he gives these three parables.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.720]   Parable of the sheep, parable of the lost coin, parable of the lost son.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:06.120]   And each one of these parables highlighting the preciousness of each one of these lost
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.240]   souls.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.160]   He turns the table on them.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.320]   You're asking me why I'm tolerating them, but I'm asking you, why do you not join me
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.920]   in pursuing them?
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.760]   Do you not know that this is God's heart?
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.960]   God has made it very plain that he does not rejoice in the judgment of the wicked.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.640]   And his whole purpose of everything that he did in the Old Testament was to prepare for
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.240]   the coming of Christ to pursue sinners.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:41.320]   So why do you not understand what I am doing?
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.600]   Zechariah chapter 2 verse 8, it says, "For thus said the Lord of hosts, 'After this glory
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.720]   sent me to the nations who plundered you, for he who touches you touches the apple of
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.720]   his eye.'"
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.960]   You know, I've done so much research on this, on the history of this word and where it came
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.960]   from.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.920]   Ultimately, basically the apple of his eye is just simple.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.520]   You know, the black part of your eye, in the Hebrew it doesn't actually use the word apple,
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.160]   it just means the core of your eye, right?
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:16.480]   It basically means like, God loves his children like we would all love the apple of our eyes.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.640]   So basically the imagery is, if you were standing close to me and I just poked my hand, you're
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.120]   natural instinct isn't going to be…
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.080]   Your natural instinct is going to be flinching, right?
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.600]   If you play softball, a ball comes near you, your immediate reaction is to have the glove
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.940]   to protect it.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:39.480]   So that's the imagery that God is using, that he protects his children like the apple of
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.480]   his own eyes.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:46.760]   In other words, he's talking about the depth of his love for his children.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.280]   Now what I think you and I need to understand is when we talk about the love of Christ,
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   we kind of love of it, talk about it in a generic sense, in love for the world, and
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.520]   maybe even love for the church.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:04.560]   When's the last time you really understood that he loves you?
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.920]   You.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.880]   Not your family, not this church, not this generation, but you.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.800]   And I always heard, you know, ever since I became a Christian, you know, God loves you,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:22.840]   he counts the hairs on your head, and it's all great in theology.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:32.320]   But when you come to that conviction that God has his eyes on you, to that extent, you,
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   he cares.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.800]   Like how much?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.720]   To send his only begotten son.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.840]   He cares.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.480]   He cares that you're lonely.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.840]   He cares that you're hurting.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.280]   He cares that you're suffering.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.200]   He cares about all of that.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.840]   And he doesn't just care about the church in general, he cares about you.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   We are a collection of people who are the apple of his eyes.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.960]   And so basically what he's saying is, see each other as people that he loves.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.720]   So we act very differently with people that we care about.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.480]   We are a lot more gracious to people that we care about.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.320]   We're a lot less eager to expose each other's sins if we care about them.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.880]   And so that's what Paul is saying, these are God's servants.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.120]   God's going to, if there's anything to deal with them, God's going to deal with them.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.840]   Let God see their hearts.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:32.040]   But as far as we're concerned, we are sinners who've been saved by the grace of God.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.920]   Isaiah chapter 49, verse 15 and 16, it says, "Can a woman forget her nursing child, that
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.760]   she would have no compassion on the son of her womb?
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.160]   Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.360]   Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.160]   Your walls are continually before me."
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.240]   When you want to make sure that you don't forget something, oftentimes you write it
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   on your hands.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.520]   Because you don't want to forget, it's too important.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.220]   Anniversary is coming up.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.000]   You screwed up last year.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.040]   You don't want to do this again.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.520]   You didn't like how it felt.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.400]   You wrote it on your hands, right?
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   It's coming up.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.000]   You dummy, don't do this again.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.480]   You put it on your hands so that while you're doing things, you forget and you're doing
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.860]   something, oh shoot, so you don't forget.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:24.400]   You don't write important things on the back of your neck, right?
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.120]   You don't put it on the heel of your foot, right?
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.000]   If it's important enough, you want to be able to see it all the time.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.960]   That's exactly how he's describing his people.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   How much he cares and loves them.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.600]   He's an apple of his eyes and he hasn't written on the palm of his hands.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.400]   In other words, he will never forget.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:49.860]   You think the God who sent his only begotten son, that even for a moment would forget the
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.080]   people that he died for?
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.040]   Even for a second, they would slip his mind and say, "Oh, I forgot.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.360]   I forgot about him.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.520]   I forgot about her."
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:05.800]   See, he says the motivation behind why we ought to be gracious is because God loves
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   them.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   It's his children.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:12.000]   It's his servants.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.960]   Recognize who we are in the eyes of God.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.200]   Because once that is restored, we act different.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.500]   The church is such a gift.
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.400]   Everything we do is better together.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.360]   You remember the early part of the church when somebody got married?
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.560]   The whole church acted like they were getting married.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:44.240]   We had so many problems in the early church when they were getting married because everybody
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.300]   acted like it was their wedding.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.880]   They all had opinions about what flowers to get and what you should eat.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.880]   It was causing problems.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.520]   I had to sit down and say, "Hey, knock it off.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.280]   You're making people feel bad."
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   Because they were so engaged.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.280]   Because we were so happy.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.960]   Got together and then no one left.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   We were loiterers anyway.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.960]   No one left.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   They stayed until the couple left.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.040]   I mean, it was just such a gift.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.520]   People are hurting.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.520]   Immediately we knew.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.200]   Their phone call is going.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:24.240]   It is such a gift that God has given us when we recognize what we have.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.880]   It's one thing to worship by yourself.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.120]   It's another thing to worship together.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.520]   It's one thing to pray by yourself.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.760]   It's another thing to pray together.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.640]   It's one thing to evangelize by yourself.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.080]   It's another thing to evangelize together.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.400]   That all of these things that God has given us as a gift that we may enjoy each other's
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:44.600]   company, but once we take our eyes off of Christ and the glue that keeps us together
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:51.400]   is no longer taking center stage of our fellowship, then the very things that God has given us
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:56.840]   to enjoy, we just tolerate.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:02.080]   Tolerate the fellowship, tolerate the diversity, tolerate the gathering, and we just bear through
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:10.040]   it and something that is a source of joy becomes a source of agony and annoyance.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.500]   This is why Paul calls us to this issue.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.040]   And that's why he keeps pounding over and over again.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:21.920]   Do not forget what it is that you have in Christ.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.800]   Keep your eyes upon Christ.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.900]   He's the author and the perfect of our faith.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.980]   See if when you fall in love with Christ and what he has done for you, take center stage
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.880]   in all your motivation, all your thoughts, and all your dreams, and all your hopes, see
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:41.720]   if that doesn't change your perspective on how you see other people because it does.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:48.280]   When our hearts begin to stray toward things that aren't essential and our hearts are celebrating
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.120]   the things that we sing about and that's the center thing that we're pursuing, see if that
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.280]   doesn't change the fellowship.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:01.720]   See if that doesn't change the people that you see around you because it does.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.560]   And that's exactly what salvation is about.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:08.640]   If the core of the fall of man resulted in a strain in relationship between husband and
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:14.320]   wife and any other relationship, then the core of restoration is to restore that in
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.720]   the love of Christ.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.960]   Would you take some time to pray with me as our worship team comes up?
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:29.120]   And again, as we take some time to pray and to worship before God, and I know in this
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:34.640]   room there's all kinds of different wrestlings and struggles and you have family members
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.880]   who are in dire situations, you have relational strains, you have all kinds of things that
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:47.760]   you have background in, but let this, for this moment, let's put that aside for today
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:54.320]   and to really fix our eyes upon Christ and what he means to me.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.540]   Remember the preciousness of the gift that you've been given, that you are a precious
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:03.480]   child of God and the people that you are sitting with are also precious children of God that
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.600]   he loves.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.680]   That God would give us that perspective, that we're not talking about strangers, we're not
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:14.480]   talking about just people, we're talking about our brothers and our sisters in Christ, that
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:20.240]   God would give us the love that is necessary to build a church that honors him.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.760]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
