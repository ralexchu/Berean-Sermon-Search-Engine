[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11, we're going to be
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.920]   looking at verse 8 and 10.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.020]   I had a two-point message thinking that I'm going to be able to get it through, but I
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.560]   did not the first service.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.480]   So we're going to stick with the first one today.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.060]   I know I'm going at a slow pace through chapter 11, but I think it's important enough for
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.760]   us to really be grounded in this chapter, just knowing the importance of what he's trying
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.840]   to say here, because this is kind of a transition chapter from chapter 1 through 10 to chapter
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.200]   12 and on.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.000]   So he's trying to connect right theology with right living.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.120]   And so if you miss either side, then it's not either saving faith or it's the wrong
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.200]   faith and wrong gospel.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.160]   So we want to make sure that the point that he's trying to get in chapter 11 is that right
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.480]   belief is what leads to right life.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.400]   And so he's really going through person by person to do that.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.600]   So we want to make sure that we do that.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.920]   So even though if we go a little bit slower, I think it'll be beneficial for us either
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920]   way.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.120]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 8 through 10, reading out of the NISV, "By faith Abraham, when
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.240]   he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.360]   and he went out not knowing where he was going.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.520]   By faith he lived as an alien in the land of the promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   in its tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.080]   For he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080]   God."
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.080]   Let's pray.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.840]   I pray that you will protect this pulpit, that only your word would go forth, and that
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   your children will hear the voice of Christ and follow him and him alone.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.800]   So we ask, Lord God, that you would hide us in your glory and that we may see Christ's
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.240]   glory and love him and worship him and follow him.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.600]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   Amen.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.160]   So again, the importance of each one of these characters that we're studying, we studied
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.680]   about Enoch, about Noah, and then now about the life of Abraham.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.480]   Abraham, if you have read through the New Testament, know that he's a very, very significant
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.040]   figure in redemptive history.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.080]   In fact, we said that the life of Noah, there's about five chapters in the book of Genesis
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.280]   that covers his life, but for Abraham in his life, there's about 14 chapters in Genesis
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   dedicated to him.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.560]   Not only that, the text that we're looking at, starting from verse 8 all the way up to
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.440]   verse 19, really has Abraham involved in some way or form or other.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.840]   In fact, they said that 308 separate times Abraham's name is mentioned in the Bible.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.560]   And sometimes when you say something like that, you can say, "Well, he's mentioned in
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.880]   three books 400 times or 300 times," but his name is actually mentioned in 27 separate
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.680]   books in the Bible, 16 in the Old Testament and 11 in the New Testament.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.480]   All of this to say that Abraham in redemptive history is a central figure.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.600]   He's outside of Christ.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.080]   His name and his life story is mentioned and is highlighted to help us to better understand
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.580]   what it means to be righteous.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.680]   And so he is called the father of righteousness for two reasons.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.560]   One, God begins the nation of Israel through him and his descendants.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.600]   And so God is making it very clear how the salvation is going to happen by faith through
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.000]   this nation.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.040]   And how the descendant that's going to come from this line is going to be the one who's
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.160]   going to come and crush the head of the serpent and bring us salvation.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.240]   So he is the initiator.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.960]   God makes a covenant with him that by blessing him, he's going to bless all the other nations,
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.480]   meaning that salvation is going to come to the world through him.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.620]   So in that sense, he is the father of faith.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.680]   He is also the father of faith because there's no greater example that we find in the Bible
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.220]   of what it means to be righteous by faith.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.680]   And so here's a man that's called and lived all of his life simply because God told him
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.060]   to.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.420]   And we'll see that at the end, Abraham and his life in every part of his life, his descendants,
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.960]   how he lived, what he pursued, all of it is an example of what it means to be a follower
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   of Christ.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.220]   And so this morning, I had two points from this text, but I'm just going to just give
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.680]   my main focus on verse one or on the first part, and then we'll get to the second part
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   next week.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.640]   So the first thing that we see about his life of faith is that God calls him out of his
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.200]   comfort zone.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.320]   And that's the first step.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.120]   When we meet God, the first thing that he does is that God has not added to their life,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.720]   that he had a good life and then said, well, you want to make it even better, you follow
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.400]   me.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.640]   First thing that God does is calls him out.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.960]   Second thing that we see about his life, and again, these are all very simple points, but
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.000]   when we look at it into his life, it's very profound.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.360]   Like, what does it mean to be a follower of Jesus Christ?
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.640]   And why was he credited as the father of faith?
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.160]   And what is it about his life that we are to emulate?
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.040]   So the second point is he lived all of his life by faith and not by sight.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.240]   He was pursuing the promise that God made to him.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.640]   And so whether he saw signs or not, his whole life, everything that he had, he went all
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.520]   in in following God's command and his promise.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.680]   So he didn't dabble in it, he didn't simply, you know, spend a part of his life or his
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.200]   youth.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.480]   Everything that he had was poured into the promise that God has made with him, that if
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.880]   you follow me, that I will fulfill this covenant that I'm making with you in Genesis chapter
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.480]   12, 1-2-3.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.620]   So we're going to look at the first part of it.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.320]   When he encounters God, the first thing God tells him to do is to come out.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.200]   Hebrews chapter 11 verse 8.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.840]   By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.640]   In Genesis chapter 12, 1, it tells us, "Now the Lord said to Abram, 'Go forth.'"
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.040]   Abram is the name that he had before God changed it to Abraham.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.880]   He said to Abram, "Go forth from your country and from your relatives and from your father's
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.400]   house to the land which I will show you."
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.440]   If you read chapter 11, right, before you came or read some part of chapter 12, you'll
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.120]   know that Abraham was not a poor man.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.360]   He didn't leave everything because he had nothing to lose, right?
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.560]   Well, you know, nothing else that I did work, so let me follow Christ and maybe my life
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.200]   will get a little bit better.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.920]   In fact, we know that Abraham was already a very wealthy man.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.280]   And he didn't leave empty-handed.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.800]   He left with his family and God called him out from where he was.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.720]   Now, first question we need to ask is why did he have to leave?
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.120]   Couldn't God keep him where he was and blessed him and let his nation, let this nation multiply?
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.600]   He already had land.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.580]   Why did he have to put that aside and walk out into the desert?
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.920]   It wasn't like God showed him that if you sacrifice this, here's a greater city waiting
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.320]   for you, so if you're willing to go, trust me, and I'll take you out of all of this and
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.480]   I'm going to give you this great land.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.140]   He said he didn't know where he was going.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.600]   Why did God call him out?
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.560]   Well, it's consistent with everything else that we see in Scripture.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.760]   When we first encounter God, what does it mean to repent?
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.440]   Our sins were not justified because we did righteous things or you basically acknowledged
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.600]   some facts about God.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.200]   We repented.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.880]   And that's why the message, the very first message that Jesus gives is repent for the
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.920]   kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.000]   Repent basically means you acknowledge that whatever it was that you are pursuing, whatever
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.620]   that you value, that you're saying that all of that was wrong.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.080]   So when we repent, we're not just simply saying, you know, I lied when I was three years old
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.840]   and I cheated and I took a candy from the store when I shouldn't and remembering all
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.080]   these little sins and so I'm not going to do that, so I repent because I've done some
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.140]   bad things.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.360]   Justification isn't simply acknowledging there are some things that I did that was wrong.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:41.160]   Repentance that leads to justification is recognizing that my being was corrupted by
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.200]   sin.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.880]   So every thought that I had, everything that I considered to be good, everything that I
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.000]   hoped for, everything that I pursued was wrong because it was outside of the will of God.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.520]   I was pursuing my comfort, my safety, my glory, my family, and all of that I surrendered to
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   God.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.680]   That's what repentance is.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.080]   So whether it is in the old covenant or new covenant, the very first thing that God calls
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.240]   us is to call us out, but here's the problem that you and I have in our generation.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.000]   So many people have only just added Christ to their life.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.080]   They've never genuinely repented of whatever it was that they were pursuing.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.440]   They say, you know what, I'm going to do this and I'm going to work hard and I'm going to
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.600]   get to the next level, but I'm going to do it in Jesus' name.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.240]   So a good Christian goes to church, they serve, they may give, but their life, nothing in
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.400]   their life ever changed.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   They never left behind the world until all they did was just add Christ and pray to Him
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.120]   that He may help us pursue what we desire.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:55.680]   The very first step in meeting Christ is to recognize that all of this is under judgment
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.480]   of God and to repent of that and to follow Him.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.360]   Galatians 1.4 says, "He who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.760]   the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father."
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.760]   According to the evil age.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:18.160]   The age that he's referring to is the culture, what this world values.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.960]   You know, as soon as we are born, right, we're in this competition, this rat race, right?
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.280]   You don't know it, but your parents were competing with you when you were a kid.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.240]   Who spoke first?
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   Who learned to brush their teeth first?
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   Who walked first?
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   Who ate first?
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.600]   Who started going to the bathroom first?
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.120]   So when you have young children, young parents get together and they compare.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.140]   They don't tell you they're comparing, but they're comparing.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.600]   So if you walked before the other kids, like, "Oh, my kid walked 10 months."
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.240]   Oh, your kid still doesn't walk?
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.240]   It's okay.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.960]   You know, eventually they'll get there.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.640]   So from the moment that we're born, there's this competition, seen and unseen.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.040]   You get a little bit older, like, "What kind of grades did you get?
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   What college did they go to?"
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.240]   And then you go to college, like, "What kind of job did you get?"
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.200]   And you get a job, it's like, "Well, who did you marry?"
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.400]   And after you get that, then you have your own kids.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.360]   So when did your kids start walking?
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   When did you retire?
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.280]   And then you retire, and it's like, "What are your kids doing for you?"
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   It doesn't end.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:27.160]   This rat race, from the moment that we are born until the day that we die, we're in this
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.640]   trap constantly comparing with each other.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.680]   And so that's the pattern of this world.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:40.000]   See, the cultural Christianity has never abandoned that.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.040]   Cultural Christianity embraces that, and then want the security and the fellowship and the
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.160]   hope that we have in Christ while we're still pursuing.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.560]   Nothing about the pursuit of this world has ever changed.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.800]   But the primary thing that God says He is saving us from, and the reason why the world
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.560]   is under this condemnation, is because everything that the world is doing is in rebellion against
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.840]   God.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   In Colossians 1, verse 13, it says, "He rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.400]   us to the kingdom of His beloved Son."
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.800]   Everything that we knew from the previous kingdom, He said, He delivered us from it.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.040]   And that's why He says in James chapter 4, "You adulterous, you do not know, do you not
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.520]   know that the friendship with the world is hostility toward God?"
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.720]   Do you notice here, He doesn't say an outright pursuit, a covenant that you made with the
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.160]   world, He says no.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.180]   Simply a friendship, a friendly term with the world is hostility toward God.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.480]   He goes even further, He says, "Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.520]   makes himself an enemy of God."
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:58.200]   He just wishes, a man who just desires, desires to be friendly with the world.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:04.760]   Why can't I be cool in the eyes of the world and still love Jesus?
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.440]   Why can't I have these nice things?
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   Why?
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.520]   You know, oftentimes the excuses that we make is, "Well, God didn't call everybody to mission,
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.560]   God didn't call everybody to ministry, God didn't call everybody to do this, God doesn't
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.720]   want Christians to be poor, God doesn't want people to be this way."
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   And so we rationalize in our head, all the while compromised, chasing after the same
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.080]   thing before we met Christ, and we never left behind the world.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.720]   And we're trying so hard to reconcile living in the world and having the world and pursuing
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.360]   the world and yet adding Christ.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.240]   Because in the pursuit of the world, there are holes.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.400]   No matter how much you pursue it, you still feel lonely.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.480]   No matter how much you pursue the world, there's still fear, like, "After I die, what's going
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.960]   to happen?"
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.480]   No matter how much I pursue the world, you don't have the kind of friendship that you
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.600]   have among Christians.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.880]   You don't get the morality that you pass on to your children.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   And so there's a lot of secular, worldly benefits of being a cultural Christian.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.240]   But we've never left behind our old world.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:13.280]   And that's why he says, "He who wants to be friends with the world, he who desires to
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.160]   be near to the world, makes himself an enemy of God."
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.960]   If you take that literally, which we ought to, it basically means that there's a lot
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.240]   of people in the church who are living friendly with God, and God considers you hostile to
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.440]   him.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.280]   The Bible tells us that you are an adulterer, John 15, 19.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.960]   If you were of the world, the world would love its own.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.800]   But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world because of this,
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.080]   the world hates you.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:51.640]   Part of the reason why in our world, where you and I live, why the persecution doesn't
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.640]   seem to be, at least for the moment, in our face, is because we probably don't look like
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.920]   Jesus.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:05.680]   When persecution comes, and when I say persecution, I'm not talking about just not fitting in.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.160]   I'm not talking about not going where they go.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.560]   We're talking about possibly losing your jobs.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.160]   The Bible says that they hate me, so they will hate you.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.040]   So the more we look like Christ, the more the world is going to remind us that they
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.000]   don't want us.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.640]   We don't want you here.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.000]   You don't belong here.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.040]   You don't think like we do.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.600]   You don't value the things that we value, so therefore we're no longer going to tolerate
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   it.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.680]   Here's the thing.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.080]   Up to this point, because we lived in this free country with religious freedom, the world
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.680]   always hated genuine Christianity, but they tolerated it up to this point.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   They never embraced it.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:50.600]   They never loved it, but they tolerated it because of the law, because it was acceptable.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.920]   But we are entering into a phase in at least United States history that the rest of the
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.120]   world is already in, that it's no longer going to be tolerated.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.780]   They say they're going to be hostile toward Christian faith.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:11.080]   So those of us who have been trying so hard, holding on to the world, yet holding on to
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.040]   God, the world is no longer going to allow that.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.880]   Either you embrace Christ or you embrace the world.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.640]   But the thing is, that's exactly what God has been telling us from the beginning.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.800]   The world kingdom and God's kingdom has always been in conflict.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:34.280]   And it is to our own deception that we fooled ourselves that somehow we're going to be Switzerland
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.320]   and be in the middle and hold on to both.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.800]   That's exactly the problem that the author of Hebrews is writing to.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.400]   These guys are persevering for a while and they started drifting back into the old world.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.720]   If you notice, if you've been with us for 10 chapters of study, the author does not
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.880]   mention any specific idolatry.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.640]   He doesn't say that there's a question to Jesus' identity.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.000]   The primary problem was they were just simply drifting back so that they can have some of
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.440]   the world and take some of the pressure off of the consequence of following Christ and
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   still have Christ.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.200]   And basically, he's shutting the door on them.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.240]   You may fool yourself to think that you're saved.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   He said he's shutting the door.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.560]   He said, no, either you're a follower of Christ or you're still in the world.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.240]   There's nothing in between.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.560]   And this is nothing new.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.600]   Jesus said that very clearly, if you want to follow me, you must what?
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.080]   Deny yourself and pick up your cross.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:39.720]   Somehow, in our generation, for whatever the reason, we have sanitized that, cut off the
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.880]   edges and made the cross a bearable cross.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.480]   That he didn't actually mean what he said to the disciples.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.560]   When he said he's going to the cross, he actually went to the cross.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.600]   He wasn't talking symbolically.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.780]   He wasn't talking theoretically.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.520]   He actually physically went and he told his disciples, where I'm going, you're going to
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.000]   come too if you want to follow me.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.560]   Show me where in the Bible did that ever change.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.880]   Show me where in the Bible that after saying that, a generation passed, 100 years, 200,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.600]   1,000 years passed, that we have a new revelation and saying, now that's not required.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.080]   That God's calling for his church has changed.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:29.120]   Clearly he doesn't mean that for Christians in this generation living in America.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.520]   Possibly the reason why the American church is so impotent is because we are trying to
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:39.160]   hold on to both and we are miserably failing.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:47.760]   From the get-go, an encounter with God demands that we leave behind our comfort.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.200]   He called Abraham out in his reaches, out in the desert.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.040]   He didn't come from one place and took him to another place of safety.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.240]   He didn't abandon his riches and then gave him even more wealth.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.120]   No, simply by promise.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.920]   Trust me and leave it behind and come.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:12.200]   A wealthy man who already had his family and walked out into the desert, not knowing, not
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.960]   knowing the enemies he was going to face, not knowing if he was going to be able to
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.000]   survive, simply because he believed.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   That's it.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.560]   There was nothing that he could tangibly see that if he followed God that this was going
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   to happen.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.880]   It's simply because he believed.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.400]   And that's why he's the father of faith.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.960]   That his whole life trajectory was he believed.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.080]   And so he packed up his bag and he went.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:47.520]   See in the scriptures, the second in the book of Leviticus, it says, if something is unclean,
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.560]   that you have to take it outside the camp.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.140]   And to be taken outside the camp basically means that you're forsaken from the community.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.920]   So if they have to have capital punishment or somebody had certain kind of disease, they
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.280]   have to be cast out outside the camp.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.320]   But here's the strange thing.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.680]   By the time Christ came, in order for John the Baptist to do his ministry, he went outside
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.200]   the camp.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.640]   And that's why they didn't know what to do with him.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.600]   Because when he should clearly, it seems like God's anointing is upon this man.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.440]   He's speaking with authority.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.600]   He wasn't like any other man.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.800]   He was the new prophet that everybody acknowledged, but it didn't fit their paradigm because he
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.840]   went outside the camp.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.200]   He didn't go into Jerusalem and pick up Pharisees.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.520]   He didn't go to the Sanhedrin and influential people.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.300]   He went outside the camp and he had the poor people, he had the prostitute tax collectors
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.320]   coming to him and they were baptizing him.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.080]   So even the Pharisees would come just curious, what's going on?
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.480]   Clearly something is going on, but why are you doing it out here?
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.960]   Why aren't you coming to the temple?
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:21:00.720]   I mean, if he was bad, Jesus came and he took it even further out.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.120]   And he made absolutely no sense.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.960]   If John the Baptist clearly had God's anointing, Jesus literally had the doves fall on him
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.360]   and God say, this is my son in whom I am well pleased.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.700]   But the very first thing that he says is repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.560]   Because whatever system that you built, whatever righteousness that you are holding on to as
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.600]   a security blanket, he says you must repent of that.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.980]   Put that beyond and then come outside the camp.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:36.520]   In the time of Christ, in order to meet Christ, instead of saying inside the camp, you actually
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.000]   have to go outside the camp.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.920]   Hebrews chapter 13, 11 through 14, for the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.160]   into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   camp.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.140]   Therefore, Jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.660]   outside the camp.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.120]   So let us go out to him outside the camp bearing his reproach.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:04.280]   For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.960]   In order to follow Christ, the very first thing that he commands us, he was crucified
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.460]   outside the camp.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.680]   And so therefore, if we want to meet him, we are called to go outside the camp.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:20.160]   Outside the camp at that time basically means whatever religious system that they set up,
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.480]   God already abandoned it.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   God already walked away from it.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.840]   They were no longer worshiping God.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:32.320]   So when Jesus came to the temple and he was angry, he was looking not only because here
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.360]   these people were taking advantage of the outer court and wouldn't allow the women and
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:42.500]   the Gentiles to come in and worship, that represented their whole attitude toward worship.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.000]   And that's why Jesus got angry.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.640]   And he wasn't simply turning the tables over of the merchants.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.400]   He was condemning the whole religious system.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.280]   Their worship had nothing to do with God.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.200]   They were just going through religious motions.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.720]   People were using the temple for profit.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.920]   And they could care less whether genuine worship was happening or not.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.360]   And that's why these disciples remembered that the love for his house, love for his
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.840]   father's house would consume him.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.920]   It wasn't just important to him.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.120]   He said it would consume him.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.280]   And that same God is no different today.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.440]   When he says that there's going to come a time that he is looking for people who will
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:34.360]   worship him in spirit and in truth, and that desire and his looking is going to consume
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:41.680]   him, meaning this religious system, this jumping through the hoops, becoming a member, finding
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.640]   the right church, having a good family, raising godly children, none of this in and of itself
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.320]   is wrong.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:56.560]   But so much of all that we do within the religious system is to maintain the cultural Christianity
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.240]   that you and I committed to.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:07.280]   And he's calling us outside the camp to abandon our comfort zone and to literally start over
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:13.160]   with life, to repent of whatever it is that we were pursuing.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:19.600]   In Psalm 118 verse 22, it says, "The stone which the builders rejected has become the
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.080]   chief cornerstone."
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:27.800]   In other words, they looked at Jesus and clearly there was something, there was something about
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.960]   him and people were amazed that he was speaking with authority.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.480]   He was speaking as if God was speaking because God himself was speaking through him.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.600]   So they couldn't just dismiss him.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.400]   But he wasn't inside the camp.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.640]   So they ended up rejecting him, crucifying him, and trying to discard him.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:52.480]   But he says, "The very stone the builders rejected became the chief cornerstone."
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:57.600]   Meaning without that cornerstone, you couldn't build anything.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.760]   You couldn't build anything.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:08.080]   That whatever that you and I have built outside of Christ, in time it's going to crumble.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:14.040]   Not realizing it is this rat race, keeping up with the Joneses or the Lees or the Chains,
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.400]   whoever it is that we're trying to keep up with.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.640]   I grieve when I see young couples who are perfectly fine and living a great life and
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.760]   all of a sudden they visit somebody's house and it's like, "Oh shoot, we're behind."
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.640]   The children are happy, they're doing fine, and all of a sudden, "Oh, my kids have kids
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.200]   but we don't."
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.920]   Or their kids are doing this but we don't have it.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.160]   Or their kids are able to send their kids to do this and learn this and learn that but
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   we're not having it.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.560]   And then we get slowly sucked up into that and we live the rest of our lives just like
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.800]   anybody else.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:53.120]   With this carrot dangling in front of us, not realizing it's that carrot, it's what's
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.680]   ruining us.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.320]   That's what's causing the contentions in marriage oftentimes.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.000]   It causes contention with your children.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.720]   It causes contention that even when God blesses you, you're not thankful because it's
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.800]   not as great as the next guy.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.360]   And so the whole worldly system is based upon us wanting to elevate ourselves.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:23.000]   So we try hard and then we, you know, when we fail, we're upset and then we don't make
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.040]   it, then we pour our hopes into our children so that they may have it.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.280]   You and I know how to recognize the health and wealth gospel.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.520]   Automatically we reject it, right?
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.640]   I mean, if you are a health and wealth gospel person and you happen to be at Bering Community
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.200]   Church, I'm guessing you're frustrated, right?
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.000]   I'm guessing you're frustrated, right?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.240]   My guess is most of you are very keen, no matter how long you've been here, that you
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.280]   can recognize health and wealth gospel because if it comes off of this pulpit, you're going
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.760]   to say, "Oh my God, that's not biblical."
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.960]   And you can point to verses that Jesus speaks.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.760]   But here's the problem.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:12.200]   The health and wealth gospel is so deeply embedded in all of us that we may automatically
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.640]   say, "Oh, that's wrong theologically."
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:22.880]   But in life, in every part of our life, we practice.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.560]   Look at the content of our prayer.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.040]   How much of our prayer is safety?
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.880]   How much of our prayer when we get sick is to be healthy?
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.040]   How much of our prayer is about security?
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.880]   So automatically, even though we reject it theologically, but in life we practice it
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.640]   without giving it a second thought.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:56.280]   First and foremost, God calls us out, recognizing, to leave behind the temptations of this world
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:03.440]   and to look at Christ, that if He is not better than whatever is tempting you, it's just a
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.640]   matter of time you're going to fall.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.160]   If He's not better, if you didn't gaze upon the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ and
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:17.080]   then you said, "Jesus is better than whatever it is that I'm tempted, whatever it is that
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:22.800]   I'm comparing my life to, He's better than anything else that is around me," then at
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.760]   some point, you're going to give in to that.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:37.520]   God calls us out, first and foremost, to recognize that all that we pursue in this world, even
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:45.440]   if your wildest dreams come true, all it does is lead to greater judgment.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.880]   If you want to find life, lose your life.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.680]   Lose your life first.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:58.440]   And He's not simply telling us this to come out because He wants us to live a hard life.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.640]   He wants us to have bad relationships.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:07.880]   It is the only way that He can lead us to the promised land if we leave our old house.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:14.320]   Only way for us to follow Him and to experience this life that He promises, we have to let
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.640]   go.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.920]   Living in between, thinking like, "I'm going to somehow have a little bit of this, a little
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:25.560]   bit of that," and then being frustrated the rest of your Christian life wondering why
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.520]   I don't experience what they experience.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:34.200]   And so we have a generation filled with people who can recite quotes from other godly men
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.320]   and women who have gone before us.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.600]   Missionary books that we've read, testimonies that we've heard, sermons that we've heard,
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.880]   and we have quotes.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.720]   "Wow, this is great."
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.000]   And we give a thumbs up.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I like that.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.880]   Corrie Tamboon, I like her.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.440]   William Carey, I like him.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.080]   And so we have a generation filled with people who have all these great sayings in our head,
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:04.040]   Bible verses memorized, text that we've studied, and the application of that is, "I like it.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.920]   That's good."
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.360]   And we admire it from a distance.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.720]   But it's never our testimony.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.680]   It's never our testimony.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.440]   I can tell you who loves Jesus.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.800]   I can tell you books that I've read.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:25.080]   I can tell you godly men that I admire from a distance, but it's never my testimony.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.400]   I'm just feeding off of the crumbs falling off the table.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:35.120]   And we always wonder why I don't experience this intimacy with God.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.360]   If you're going to a banquet and you know that the best food is waiting for you, you
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.880]   don't go there and pick up cup ramen right before you go.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.880]   You ready yourself.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   You might even skip breakfast because you don't want to spoil the meal.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.000]   You want to make sure that you're going to enjoy and you're going to be able to taste
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.760]   every part of this meal because you're anticipating and preparing yourself.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.440]   How much of the dissatisfaction do we have in our relationship with God because we have
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.960]   nibbled on the crumbs of this world and we've lost our appetite for God?
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.040]   And we come to worship God and we say, I don't feel anything.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   It doesn't feel the same.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.080]   Thinking that somehow God is hiding from us.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.560]   That he somehow, if we got to figure it out, if we adjust this and do this, that somehow
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.720]   we can figure this out, that maybe we're already full.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.880]   Maybe we've given our hearts and our lives to the things that don't matter and then now
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.440]   we come to Christ and there's no room for him.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.560]   You know what's interesting?
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:46.920]   If you read the Old Testament history, if you remember Jonah, Jonah refused to go to
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.920]   Nineveh.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.840]   Nineveh was the capital of Assyria and you have to understand, Assyria, these guys were
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.640]   brutal people.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.900]   You know, they would be equivalent to the modern terrorists.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.880]   In order to bring fear, they would behead people and they went even further than that
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.040]   because the terrorists targeted certain people.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.840]   I mean, they would conquer nations and anybody that they would consider a threat, they would
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:13.160]   literally behead them, crucify them and then hang them up so that their children and their
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.120]   wives can walk by and see that.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   That's how brutal they were.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:22.800]   They would skin people alive to bring fear upon Israel.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.840]   But you know what's interesting?
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.920]   Assyria, after they do their damage, is not mentioned.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.000]   They come in, they brutalize Israel and then the Babylonians come.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.880]   And then Babylonians kind of take them into captivity.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:44.600]   They take in the best of Israel and then they've actually gave them opportunity to grow.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   They assimilated.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   In fact, many of the Jews who got captive and was taken into Babylonia ended up becoming
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   high officials.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   Right?
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.480]   You read the book of Daniel.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.700]   So they went there and they assimilated, learned their language, their culture.
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:05.520]   They started to adopt their idols into their life and so we have stories of Shadrach, Meshach,
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.600]   and Abednego and Daniel was refusing.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.040]   But for the most part, nation of Israel just assimilated.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.840]   But God's plan was always to bring them back.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.440]   After the judgment of 70 years, God was going to raise up Cyrus and then the Persians were
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.760]   going to let them come back.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.440]   And Cyrus was so generous, he actually did a fundraiser to support them.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.720]   You guys can go back and reestablish the nation of Israel, reestablish the temple, but by
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.760]   the time he lets them go, nobody wanted to go.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.000]   A very few remnant volunteered and went back.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.960]   Why would they go back?
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.160]   Because Israel's already destroyed.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.000]   The temple is gone.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.720]   They're surrounded by hostile nations.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.280]   Why would they go back to that when they're comfortable where they are?
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.400]   And so the way that nation of Israel scattered was not because of Assyria.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:04.320]   It was because of Babylon, because they were tempted and they assimilated and they wanted
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.360]   to stay where they were comfortable.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:13.080]   That's why if you look at the book of Revelation, when the kingdom of Satan is described, it
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.480]   is described as Babylon.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.040]   Babylon.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.520]   Most people who know anything about Babylon, they weren't brutal.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.760]   They were very cultured.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:30.440]   They gave opportunity for the Jews to assimilate and even take high positions.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.240]   Our greatest temptation in our generation is not the Assyrians.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:41.160]   You know, we're afraid that persecution is going to come and it's going to make it impossible
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.880]   for us to function in this world.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.520]   You know what the genuine response of a genuine Christian should be?
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   Great!
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.360]   Because that's going to help us.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.600]   Persecution is going to help us.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.920]   Because what we are not, we weren't willing to let go.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.400]   We're having a hard time letting go.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.680]   The force, the earth is going to, the world is going to force us to let go.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:10.000]   Because they're not going to tolerate nominal Christianity.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   The danger is not the Assyrians.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.160]   It's the Babylonians.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:22.800]   It's where the world has saturated into our thinking, our being, our affection, where
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:28.520]   we voluntarily are drifting away from Christ.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.480]   We're not drifting away from Christ kicking and screaming.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:38.240]   We're not drifting away from Christ yelling out and crying out in prayer meetings.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:45.960]   We're volunteering joyfully, drifting from Christ, knowing that that's where we're going
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.040]   because we have been tempted by Babylon.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.760]   First thing that God calls us to do if we're going to be a man and woman of faith, a church
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:03.600]   of faith, that we need to repent of all that has seeped into us from this world and to
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.000]   get out of this rat race.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.600]   It is the rat race that causes the contention between husband and wife.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:21.680]   It is the rat race that the children that we are raising, that we didn't do it on purpose,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.800]   that we've kind of brought them through, now they're struggling with it.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.720]   And everything that we think, oh, we want to make an easier life, we want to make it
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:35.240]   easy, we want to take care of our children, in the name of being good parents, we've made
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:40.560]   Babylon attractive.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:50.960]   First and foremost, as I've been warning and encouraging, that period of tolerating biblical
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   Christianity is slowly starting to fade.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.520]   And I think it's going to come pretty quickly.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.520]   And I don't say this to scare you.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.960]   I don't say this to get you to be uncomfortable.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.960]   It's just what I see.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.160]   And I think most pastors will agree that that's where we're headed into.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.120]   And to be honest, I'm not worried about my generation.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.880]   We're looking at retirement at some point.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.680]   Not anytime soon, but it's closer than the beginning.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.400]   I'm worried about our kids.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:32.520]   I'm worried about your children who are in Sunday school.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.360]   That in the next five to ten years, when they're in junior high school and high school and
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.920]   college, what will Christianity look like for them?
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:49.680]   The Catholic Church drifted so far away from God that by the time biblical Christians began
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.760]   to quote scripture, they were beheaded and burned at the stake.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.800]   That's how far that they drifted.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.400]   You and I come from a tradition of protestors.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.840]   That's why we're called Protestants.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.440]   Because men and women who had the courage to open up the Bible and say, "What you're
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.600]   doing doesn't make any sense.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.760]   What you're doing doesn't fit the Christianity that I know.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.000]   The Jesus that you're worshiping is not the Jesus that I'm reading in scripture."
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.360]   So they protested.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.000]   And it is the protest that led us to where we're at.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.660]   Five hundred years have passed now.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.880]   Now the Christianity that you and I participate in oftentimes doesn't look anything like what
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.760]   we see in scripture.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:35.800]   And so we can easily just go along or we can open up the scriptures for ourselves.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.000]   And this is why we're trying to get you into the Bible because you can dismiss me and say,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.680]   "You know, Pastor Peter's just too extreme.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.800]   That's his personality."
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.440]   But I want you to look at the scripture yourself with your own eyes and see if what you see
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:55.000]   in our culture looks anything like the Bible that you and I are reading.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:03.600]   And if it is different, we need another reformation.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.120]   We need to come before God and repent that we have drifted.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.840]   Not just individually, but as a generation.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:20.760]   That when we pray to God, that we're not just praying for God to give us a job, make our
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:26.200]   families better, that if I'm sick so that I can be healthy, so that my children could
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.360]   be raised in a comfortable place, so that my work would not persecute me.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.200]   We're not simply praying for these small things.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.680]   And again, I'm not saying that these things are not important.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.040]   But I believe what you and I need to pray for is much bigger than that.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:50.040]   We've drifted so far from God as our generation that what's happening in the Middle East looks
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.360]   strange to us.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.960]   What's happening in India is like, "Oh my gosh, it must be so hard for these Christians
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.480]   because people don't like them.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.200]   And they're risking their lives and their well-being to share the gospel.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.000]   Wow, it must be so hard for them."
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.160]   Not realizing what you and I experience here is weird.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:19.960]   What you and I have accepted to be normal is inconsistent with Scripture.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.560]   What we see over there is exactly what we see here.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:31.640]   So as we continue to study Abraham and these men and women of faith, I pray that it would
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:37.080]   not simply be an academic study, a theological study and say, "I don't believe in health
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.960]   and wealth, doctor.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.280]   I believe in biblical Christianity.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.120]   I believe in the right gospel.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.120]   I like it."
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.640]   That that's not where it leads us.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:58.080]   That we would as individuals look at the life of Abraham as the example of saving faith
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.080]   and repent.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.080]   Genuinely repent.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.080]   Genuinely repent.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:14.960]   It is a miserable place to be, to be religious without Christ.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.280]   Because religiousness without Christ is sacrifice without reward.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.800]   It's sacrifice without reward.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.120]   Life is hard enough as it is living in this fallen world.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.080]   Relationships are hard enough as it is.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.840]   Raising children in this fallen world is hard enough as it is.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.240]   Resisting temptation is hard enough as it is.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:42.520]   And then to not have the joy in Christ, and then to not have the hope in Christ, and the
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.720]   intimacy of Christ, and then the love of Christ.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:55.080]   The most miserable people are religious people who do not know Christ.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:02.480]   The only way that you and I would be willfully, joyfully leaving these things behind is if
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.920]   we genuinely see that in comparison to surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ, it looks
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.320]   like rubbish.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.280]   I don't want to nibble at this world.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:19.160]   I'm saving myself for the banquet that He promised.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:24.080]   So I pray that that would be our passion, that would be our pursuit.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.240]   break.
