[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780]   Alright, let's get together.
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.280]   Colossians chapter 2, 16 to 23.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.960]   Okay.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:23.600]   Let me ask you, now that we've been in it maybe about 5 or 6 weeks, are you getting
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.680]   the hang of things and asking questions and looking for observations?
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.040]   Okay.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.440]   Yes?
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.000]   Alright.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.280]   Tell me, just by show of hands, because I can't tell just by you nodding your head,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.320]   how many of you feel like you're getting the hang of things?
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.120]   Okay, raise your hand.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.360]   How many of you guys are getting lost every week?
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.800]   Okay, a few of you.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800]   Okay.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.720]   You're getting the hang of getting lost every week, huh?
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.360]   Okay, good.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.000]   Alright, like I said, from the beginning, our goal in the study wasn't simply to go
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.640]   through Colossians, it was to kind of give you some guidelines as to what to look for
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.800]   and how to do Bible study on your own.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.040]   Okay, so that's why we're not going through every line by line thoroughly, the meaning
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.440]   behind it, because it would, there would be too much to cover and there's no way I'm
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.480]   going to be able to do that in 30 minutes every single week.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.120]   So the goal of it is just to highlight it, give some outlines, certain things to look
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.620]   for so that you can do your study and hopefully that the main part of your study is something
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.640]   that you do on your own and then when you come, you're able to share with your group.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.120]   Okay, so let me pray first and then we'll jump in.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.160]   Gracious Father, we thank you for your living word.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.800]   We thank you for the amazing truth, Lord God, that we find week to week.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.240]   There's so much depth and wisdom behind all that you have to tell us.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.320]   Help us, Lord God, to search through it, to really dig for treasures.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.280]   Every part of it, Lord God, speaks to us.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   It enlightens us.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.760]   It gives us a vision of who you are and what you desire.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.800]   We pray that through it that you would teach us to know you better.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.080]   We thank you, Father Jesus, and we pray.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   Amen.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.120]   All right, so the first thing we want to look at is the hermeneutical principle and every
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.400]   week we're looking through are there any kind of repeated words or phrases that give us
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.440]   some guidelines as to what you should be looking for.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.920]   One of the first things that I mentioned, if you look at the first page that was passed
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.040]   out, compare translations to see if there are words or phrases that have been translated
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.960]   differently to clarify certain ambiguous references in the text.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.160]   So the four translations that I usually look into is the NASV, ESV, NIV, and the KJV or
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   the NKJV.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.520]   Now, if you have Bible programs or if you're online looking through translations, you can
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.760]   probably find about 40 or 50 different translations.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.280]   You don't need to be comparing all of that.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.080]   The reason why I choose these is because of the different philosophies that they used.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.120]   The first line is the literal.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.520]   King James is the most literal.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.440]   King James didn't care if you understood it or not.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.480]   They just did not care.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.760]   So if that's exactly what it means, that's exactly what they put in there.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.720]   Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense in English.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.320]   So the reason why I look at King James is when there's certain phrasing that's really,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   really awkward, and even for King James sometimes, it's to the point where it makes no sense
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   at all.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.040]   Like I said, King James, it's just put whatever was in Greek, they just put it in.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.680]   Even the word order, they follow the exact word order.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.560]   But if you have a hard time understanding if something is awkward, you know there's
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.600]   something in the Greek that they had a hard time translating.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   So it wasn't simple.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.440]   So if it was, "I ate food," that's not hard to translate in any language.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.800]   Maybe the order of the verb and the subject, all of that may be twisted or maybe it would
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.920]   be in a different order, but that's not hard to translate.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.480]   But if you speak two languages or more languages, you know there are certain words or phrases
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.280]   that you cannot translate.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.600]   And so sometimes it would be a single word, but you would have to use a whole phrase to
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.240]   translate that.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.380]   Or sometimes it would be a phrase and there's a good word in the other language that can
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.640]   summarize the meaning behind that.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.680]   So those of you who speak two languages, which probably many of us in this room, or at least
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.440]   somewhat, you know at least enough that there are certain words that just can't be translated
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   that way.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.840]   So when you compare the translations, you'll see that the words that are not easily translated,
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.080]   oftentimes you'll see the words differently in each translation or the phrase will come
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.120]   out differently in each translation.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.120]   I know that some of you are already doing that, but that already tells you there's something
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.600]   going on in the Greek.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.280]   Now it doesn't mean that there's hidden meaning, it just means that there wasn't an exact word
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.940]   that they could have used.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.040]   So that's why there's debate as to well this word.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.240]   So sometimes it's good to look at all of it.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.880]   A perfect example of the word is the word "meno".
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.240]   It means to abide, and the word abide has many different facets of that word.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.400]   And so if you look at the different translations, it'll say "remain", "to continue", "to abide",
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.120]   and all of that combined is the meaning of that word.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.520]   So each translation only picked one that they thought would capture to the best of their
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520]   ability.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.600]   But if you really want to know, you have to know the meaning behind all of it because
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.480]   that word encompasses all of it.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.360]   So I think getting in the habit of comparing translations is a good way to study the Bible.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.280]   So now it's online.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.620]   So before I used to have a Bible that had four translations.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.240]   So basically New Testament was this thick because it was four translations.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.160]   So you open it up and it would have about five or six different translations and the
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.440]   Greek text.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.960]   And then so I was able to look it up like this and show it.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.600]   So whenever I looked at that Bible, again, just...
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.880]   It would be huge.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.320]   The four, the three different philosophies of translation...
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   Did I say something?
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.280]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   Okay.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.480]   Somebody already pointed that out to me.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.920]   Okay.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.640]   You guys can fix it on your own.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.360]   So the literal translations are the ones that use the philosophy where they're going to
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.600]   make it as close to the Greek as possible.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.160]   So NASB, King James, and RSV was translated with that philosophy.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.880]   So it's not that they made it difficult.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.120]   So when it comes to NASB and RSV, they tried to make it so that it's understandable, but
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.800]   their primary philosophy was they're going to keep it to the Greek as close as possible.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.200]   Where King James used the same principle, but they just didn't care.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.240]   They just stuck with the Greek.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.320]   Dynamic equivalent, NIV, and there are other translations, but the NIV is the one that
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.080]   most people know about.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.800]   Dynamic equivalent is they did their best to translate the Greek text, except when it
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.080]   came to things that you couldn't understand.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.960]   If they phrased it a certain way that it just wouldn't make sense in English, they translated
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.760]   it for you.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.200]   So it's kind of in between the literal and the paraphrase.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.700]   That's what the NIV is.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.840]   But the reason why NIV is not the best translation to study out of, if you're really trying to
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.960]   dig, because when it came to certain issues, they translated it for you.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   Meaning they basically put into the Bible, this is what this word means.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.120]   This is what this phrase means.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.320]   This is what Paul meant when he said this.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.500]   So they go the extra step and it kind of functions like a commentary.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.400]   For the most part, it's a great Bible.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.520]   I would say majority of it, that is not an issue.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.960]   But there's enough of it in the NIV that as you are studying it, word for word, verse
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.360]   by verse, chapter by chapter, oftentimes when you compare with other translations, especially
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.560]   the literal translations, they did a lot of translating for you.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.360]   It's almost kind of like reading a commentary rather than the Bible itself.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:41.400]   And then the paraphrase translation, obviously, is they wanted to get the Bible, but they
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.720]   were more interested that you understood it.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.880]   So they paraphrased it.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:52.520]   So I've been going back and forth with Everest, whether this is a dynamic equivalent or not.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:09:01.440]   The pigeon, P-I-D, not the pigeon, the bird, but the message, the Ebonics Bible, these
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.400]   are all things that they were more concerned that you understood it in modern language.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.560]   Let me read John 3, 16 for you in the pigeon language, okay?
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:18.840]   God went get so plenty love and aloha for the people inside the world that he went send
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:28.340]   me his one and only boy so that everybody that trust me don't get cut off from God,
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.680]   but get the real kind life that stay the max forever.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:41.200]   Again, we were going back and forth whether this is dynamic equivalent or not.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.800]   I'm not sure about that.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   Anyway, the reason why I sometimes compare with the paraphrase translations, because
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.640]   it's hard to understand in the literal, and even the dynamic equivalent, you kind of have
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.880]   a hard time understanding what it means.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.920]   So when I look at the paraphrase, they actually would have a whole sentence.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.640]   It's almost kind of looking at a commentary, that this is what they think that this meant.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.960]   So whenever I study the Bible, I have different translations that are open on my computer
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.940]   and I compare, especially the ones that are difficult to understand.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:22.760]   So in this text that we're looking at, there's some examples of that.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   What are some words...
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:32.600]   I already got a couple of questions about elementary principle, taking his stand, the
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   word self-abasement.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:40.400]   These are a lot of words that you look at and say, "Well, what does he mean by that?"
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.600]   We'll get to that.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.200]   So if you look at the different translations, you'll see that those words were translated
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.400]   differently in different translations.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.600]   So you already know what's going on.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.320]   There's something going on that couldn't be translated directly.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:04.200]   The word here for self-abasement literally means voluntary humility by own volition.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:12.720]   Now King James straight up said, "Like some voluntary humility, or delight in voluntary
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   humility."
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   That's what it says.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.080]   But what does that mean?
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:27.040]   So the ESV translated asceticism, NIV translated false humility, and then the NASB translated
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.040]   self-abasement.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:34.520]   So again, you kind of get the idea that there's something going on here that couldn't be translated
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.080]   literally, so they have to use what?
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.160]   The context.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:45.760]   The context of what could he have possibly meant by voluntary humility.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:52.640]   So we're not there yet, but since we're here, what do you think he means when you look at
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.080]   the context?
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.520]   Voluntary humility.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:07.720]   Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize, but abide delighting in self-abasement.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.280]   Look at all the different translations.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.600]   Asceticism, false humility, voluntary humility.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.040]   What do you think he means by self-abasement?
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:25.960]   Looking at the context.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.280]   Look at the context of what he's been saying, and what he is saying.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.560]   What does it mean to delight in self-abasement?
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:47.360]   Are you guys thinking, or just waiting?
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.400]   What is he talking about in the context?
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   Faith?
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.520]   Okay, fake humility.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.200]   What is he talking about in the context here though?
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.080]   Self-denial, right?
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.240]   Don't do this, don't do that, don't touch this, right?
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.280]   So basically when they're doing that, what are they doing?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:14.760]   They're presenting themselves as godly by denying themselves, but it's fake, right?
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.920]   Because what are they doing that for?
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.560]   They're all of that for what?
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.080]   For presentation, just like the Pharisees.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.400]   When they would fast, they would make sure that everybody knew that they were fasting,
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   right?
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.000]   They put on long faces and they're walking around saying, "Hey, I'm fasting, I'm not
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   eating."
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.120]   So all of that, that self-denial, this fake godliness on the outside, all for self-righteousness,
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.760]   right?
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.880]   So if you look at it in the context, voluntary humility, false humility, asceticism, self-abasement.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.840]   So when you look at it, it's like, okay, they translate it in different words, but when
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.420]   you put that all together within the context in which he's writing it, he's talking about
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:04.040]   somebody who's using their humility, but they're not really humble.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.360]   They say, "Look at my humility.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.400]   I'm the most humble person in the world."
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:17.200]   So it's the opposite of humility, it's fake humility.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:23.040]   So that's just an example of looking at the text, looking at the different translations,
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.840]   see what's going on, dig a little bit further, and then the immediate context is always the
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.020]   one that you wanna look at, right?
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.640]   And then if you wanna go a step further than that, you look at cross-references.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.760]   Or there are other parts of the Bible where this word is used, and how did Paul and how
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.940]   did other writers use this word?
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:47.080]   And that'll help you to see collectively, "Oh, this is what he means by that."
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:53.640]   So when it comes to this, so far I've asked you to not to look at commentaries, not to
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.180]   read your study Bibles, because I don't want you to jump from the text to someone else's
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.160]   insights and then say, "I've got an insight," right?
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.800]   You get in the habit of doing that, you'll be doing that all your life and you'll never
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   really know the Bible.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.000]   You'll know what somebody says about the Bible, but you don't know the Bible itself, okay?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.600]   One of the tools that I would want to introduce to you is a Bible dictionary.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.080]   So especially for something like this.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:24.120]   So when a word comes out that is hard to understand, the translators had a difficult time, then
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.360]   that's when a Bible dictionary comes out and you look up that word and look at the literal.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.680]   A lot of times it doesn't help, okay?
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   [laughter]
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:39.840]   And the reason why it doesn't help, it'll say, "Humility, lowering yourself," right?
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   Something like that.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:46.200]   So it doesn't necessarily help until you get to the actual application of it, right?
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:55.800]   So if you say, like, "Submission," the literal word is to put yourself under military command
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.440]   or something to that effect, or stand under something.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.000]   Or "Perseverance" is to be under pressure, right?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.200]   Standing under pressure, that's a literal understanding of it.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.800]   So those type of words, when you look at the literal understanding of it, it gives you
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.480]   a picture, right?
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.960]   "Patience" literally means long suffering, suffering for a long period of time.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:21.160]   So those type of things, it helps, but that's not there for every single word.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.800]   Sometimes you can get carried away, and sometimes I hear preachers saying, "God says to work
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.520]   hard, and work hard means to really labor with all your might."
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.380]   Yeah, that's what "work hard" means, you know what I mean?
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.640]   But they kinda get carried away thinking, like, if you dig into the Greek, there's some
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.520]   special meaning that you're gonna be able to find in every single word, in every single
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.600]   context, it doesn't.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.640]   Majority of it is plain in the text itself.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.840]   Only when it comes to words like this, where it's clearly they had a hard time translating
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.560]   it with one word.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.360]   Then you can go to the extra help to help you to do that, right?
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.780]   You don't need to be carried away.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.120]   Majority of what you need to know is already in the English, okay?
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.800]   So that's my point.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.080]   Alright, let's look at the outline.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.120]   I outlined it in three ways, let no one judge you.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:18.720]   If you look at it, the two words that pop out in verse 16 and 18 is "let no one," right?
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.180]   Let no one judge you, verse 18, let no one defraud you, right?
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.560]   So that's the first outline.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.640]   Let no one judge you, 18, 19, let no one defraud you.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.000]   Again, this is not science, this is just, you know, this is the way I outlined this.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.800]   So if I was giving a sermon, or if I was giving a lesson, this is the outline that I see,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.480]   and this is how I would break it up, okay?
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.000]   Because this is, I see his thought flow in this way, okay?
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.280]   And then the last part, verse 20 to 23, "If you died with Christ, then why do you live
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   for the world?"
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.860]   If this happened, why do you do this?
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.920]   And that's verse 20 to 23, okay?
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.040]   What's interesting is, if we go back to the previous passage in chapter 2, verse 4, and
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.680]   then chapter 2, verse 8, it also has the "no one" verse, right?
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.040]   Let no one delude you, in chapter 2, verse 4, right?
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.160]   With persuasive speech.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.980]   Chapter 2, verse 8, let no one take you captive.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:27.520]   So if you look at these four "no one" statements, chapter 2, verse 4, 8, 16, and 18, the first
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:35.440]   two about not, let no one, let no one delude you, let no one take you captive, with false
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.560]   teaching, okay?
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.000]   So the two warnings is about false teaching.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.120]   The two warnings that are here is the application of that false teaching, okay?
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.520]   So the "no one" in verse 2 and 8, and then the "no one" in verse 16 and 18 are connected.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   Because Paul is basically giving them warning about these false prophets who are coming
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.600]   in and they're deluding the truth and they're taking you captive, and don't let them judge
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.540]   you, and don't let them defraud you of your prize.
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:13.420]   So the two are, watch out for false teaching, and then the next two is basically watch out
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.680]   for the, watch out for the application of these false teaching, okay?
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   All right, so that's where we are.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:36.720]   So therefore, no one, no one, no one judge you, no one defraud you, okay?
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.160]   Regarding food or drink, and this is a theme that we see here, right?
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.240]   Do not touch, do not eat, do not taste, right?
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.960]   About respect for festivals, new moons, and Sabbath day.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.160]   Who is this speaking to, Jews or Gentiles?
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.040]   Clearly, the Jews.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.480]   The Gentiles didn't practice the Sabbath, right?
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.960]   So he's talking to the Judaizers who are coming in and saying, "It is not enough for you to
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.700]   believe in Jesus.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.960]   You have to believe in Jesus and you have to be a Jew."
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.360]   So you have to first be a Jew to be a Christian.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.160]   That's what the basic teaching of the Judaizers were.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.680]   So remember, we talked about where Colossae existed.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.560]   How close are they to Galatia?
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.560]   Remember?
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:26.280]   Right, they're right there, right?
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.400]   So remember when Paul wrote Galatians, right?
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.880]   Because of the concern that the Judaizers were having on the churches, and not just
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.800]   Galatia but all the churches there.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   Colossae is one of the churches there.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:43.560]   So Judaizers had a tremendous influence in that area, that area in Asia Minor, okay?
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.760]   So he's addressing that issue of these false teachers who are coming in and saying that
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.640]   you're not free, right?
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.200]   You still have to obey these laws.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.240]   So Paul is writing this to basically saying that, right, don't let them judge you.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.200]   In other words, don't let them pressure you to go back to the old system.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.400]   These are just these festivals, what to eat, new moon festival, Sabbath.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.760]   These are things that's the shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ,
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.920]   okay?
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.600]   The word for substance, I think somebody asked a question.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:24.840]   The word for substance literally means body.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.880]   That make sense?
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:33.560]   So when you look at it in the Greek, when it says body, it says the shadow, all of these
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.800]   things are a shadow, but the real body is Christ.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.780]   It makes a lot more sense in the Greek, right?
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.880]   So King James says body.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:50.560]   Yeah, everything else, they said substance or anybody have NIV or, I forgot to put that
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   down.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   Who has different translation of the NISB?
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   Huh?
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.560]   Bound?
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   Found?
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.560]   Foundation?
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   NIV.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   How did you get that?
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.560]   Which translation are you looking at?
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.560]   Yeah, reality is in Christ, right?
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   That's what I remember.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.560]   Anybody have ESV?
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   I think ESV also has substance, right?
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   Yeah, okay.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.680]   All right, so it's one of those words, again, I think, I don't know why they didn't translate
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.400]   it body, because the body makes a lot more sense, because it directly connects the shadow
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.520]   to Jesus, right?
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.720]   So in other words, what is he saying?
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.160]   That all of these things were just a shadow, reflection of Christ.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:54.160]   So why would you go back to the reflection when the body, who is Jesus, shows up, right?
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.000]   Unless you didn't have the body, all you had was a shadow, then you're carefully studying
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.760]   the shadow, but why would you carefully study the shadow when Jesus is standing right in
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.260]   front of you, right?
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.760]   That's his point.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.480]   So don't let them judge you on these things, because the reality, the body itself has come
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.480]   in Christ.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.160]   Verse 18, "Let no one keep defrauding you of your price."
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.680]   Not only are they judging you, they're preventing you from your price if you go back to the
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.840]   old covenant, by delighting in self-abasement, and we already talked about that, right?
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.000]   This false humility of thinking that they're being pious, right?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.980]   And that was a whole rebuke toward the Pharisees and the scribes, right?
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.380]   Everything you do, you do for other people to see.
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.280]   You're not being righteous in the eyes of God, you wanna be seen as righteous before
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.040]   men, right?
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.080]   And that was the Judaizers.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.160]   You can be a Christian, but you still have to fall in line.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:51.360]   So basically what the Judaizers were doing, they earned this religious credit among the
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.120]   Jewish people, and they were the top leaders in the synagogue, so everybody had to submit
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   to them.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.040]   So when Christianity came, all of a sudden, Jesus flips the table over.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:08.320]   He had tax collectors, he had fishermen, he had people who didn't have strong standing
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.280]   in society, all of a sudden, they became the leaders.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.480]   So what the Judaizers were doing is they were trying to maintain their status while bringing
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.120]   in Christianity.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.360]   So by them saying, "No, no, you have to keep the Sabbath, you gotta do this, this, and
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.520]   this," which they were already doing, they were experts in doing.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.980]   They were known in the community as being law keepers, right?
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.280]   So it wasn't simply a confusion of the law, it wasn't simply that they had a hard time
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.760]   transitioning from the covenant, old to the new covenant.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.960]   What they were having a hard time with is this new kingdom where he completely overthrows
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.040]   their values.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.620]   They wanted to maintain their status while bringing Christianity underneath, right?
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.640]   So you can convert, and we're allowing you to come because of Jesus, but you still have
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.300]   to come under us, right?
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.200]   And that's what's being rebuked, that everything that they do is not because they're seeking
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.760]   righteousness, it's false humility, false righteousness.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.380]   Worship of angels, which we talked about, in that particular area, Asia Minor was struggling
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.980]   with that.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.160]   Taking a stand on visions he has seen.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:20.320]   Again, the word "taking a stand," some of your translations says, "goes into much detail,"
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.320]   right?
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   "Goes into great detail."
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.720]   Basically, what he's saying is, this is their source of pride.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.640]   They're going on and on about this extracurricular vision that they saw, and what is the reason
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.880]   why they're doing that?
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.960]   I'm more spiritual than you, right?
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:44.400]   Just like their false humility, they're going into these details in order to what?
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.880]   Just like the NASB says, "to take their stand."
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:53.280]   In other words, to keep status above everybody else, right?
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.680]   Does that make sense?
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.680]   Or you look confused.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.360]   It make sense?
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.360]   Okay.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.560]   So, all of it has the same theme.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.240]   It's fake righteousness, all for the purpose of their own glory, right?
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.440]   Inflated without cause by fleshly mind, right?
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:17.000]   In other words, they have no real cause to brag.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.040]   It's all in their flesh.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.040]   It's not real.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.440]   And then, verse 19, "and not holding fast to the head," because true righteousness in
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.960]   the New Covenant is found in relation to Christ, right?
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.160]   So they're trying to find their status and righteousness outside of Christ, which is
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.220]   all false humility, false righteousness.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.780]   They're going into details about visions and experiences that they had, instead of connecting
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.240]   to Christ, right?
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   So doesn't that happen in our generation, in our churches, in our lives?
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:57.000]   If we want status and to be recognized, we can talk about our experiences.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.280]   We can talk about how much schooling that we had.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.360]   We can talk about how big our churches are.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.080]   We can talk about our status, our finances, whatever it may be.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.280]   If we want to be recognized, we present, "This is what I did.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.680]   Oh, I fasted this much," or "I did that and I did that," right?
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.000]   And that's basically what they're saying is doing.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.280]   They're trying to present themselves to be more godly, more righteous than other people,
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.200]   but it's all fake, right?
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.840]   It has nothing to do with Christ.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:33.000]   And not holding fast to the head, not holding fast to the head, which is Christ, for whom
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.460]   the entire body, right?
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:45.400]   So notice how he says that the shadow is what to come, but the body belongs to Christ, which
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.120]   is fulfilled, and we are part of that body, right?
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.200]   So again, it would make a lot more sense in the Greek when you're reading it and you see
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.400]   these words that are connected, right?
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:04.600]   So the entire body being supplied and held together by joints and ligaments grows with
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.080]   growth, which is from God.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.040]   So how does growth happen?
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.580]   Our body connected to his body, right?
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:20.100]   When we are connected to his body, all this stuff about self-abasement, worship of angels,
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:27.740]   you know, taking stand on divisions, inflated by our flesh, all of these things are fake
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.120]   that God rejects, right?
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.280]   What God desires is for us to be connected to the head, that our body connected to his
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.760]   body, right?
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.840]   And then he goes to the second part, "If, then why," right?
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.220]   If you died with Christ, why do you live in the world, right?
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.820]   That's the argument.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.580]   If you died with Christ, the elementary principles of the world, the word here for elementary
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.680]   principles, again, is another one of those words that, you know, requires a little bit
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.620]   of digging.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:09.180]   The word, again, literally means rudimentary things, like fundamental, foundational, right?
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.540]   ABCs.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:17.540]   So if you died to the ABCs of the elementary principles of the world, and what is he talking
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:24.020]   about here, the elementary principles?
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.000]   The law, specifically.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.820]   This is why you need the context, right?
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.380]   Without the context, you can say, you know, like you can just go into just the world and
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.620]   say, "Oh, these are the fundamental things that we learn," like, you know, ABC 1, 2,
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   3, right?
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.780]   That's not what he's talking about.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:48.020]   He's talking about specifically the elementary principles that was given to you in God's
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.020]   design.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:55.940]   In other words, you're going back to the first step, right?
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.700]   God brought you to calculus, but you're going back to plus and minus.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.300]   Does that make sense?
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:08.140]   So in other words, he's saying, if you died to the elementary principle, the ABCs of the
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:15.020]   gospel, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to the decrees?
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:21.940]   The purpose of learning ABCs is so that you can read, right?
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.660]   You don't go around memorizing ABCD and then you're 15, you're still, "ABCD."
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:31.780]   Wow, you're really good at your ABCDs, but you can't read.
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.060]   Because the point of learning the ABCD is so that you can read.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.180]   And then every year you're learning to read better.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:42.620]   So in other words, he planted his law in the Old Testament and all the covenant and all
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:48.260]   the things of Leviticus as a foundation, right?
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.060]   As a foundation for what?
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.900]   To understand Christ.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.540]   So understanding Christ, he gave us all of this so that we can read Christ.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:02.820]   So if you, if you miss Christ, you miss the whole point of the ABCs.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:09.140]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:17.140]   So if you don't understand how Leviticus, how Numbers, how Old Testament laws, the prophecies,
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:22.820]   the judgment, the kings, how all of this laid the foundation for the coming of Christ, then
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.380]   you missed the whole point of the Old Testament.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.460]   Isn't that exactly what Jesus said?
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.980]   He looked for the scriptures to look for life.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.820]   In other words, you thought that the ABCs were going to give you life.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:36.020]   He said, "ABCs was all about me."
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.340]   That's why he says, "I didn't come to abolish the law."
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.340]   He didn't come and say, "The ABCs are wrong."
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.740]   What did he say?
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.020]   "I came to fulfill it."
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.180]   You learned your ABCs so that you can know who I am, right?
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.260]   That's what he means.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:58.140]   If you died to the elementary principles because now the body, now the shadow, right, that
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:04.900]   was cast by the body, Christ, came, why are you laying again the foundation of ABC, right?
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.920]   If you know how to read.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.260]   You don't take somebody who knows how to read and say, "Hey, I got a lesson for you.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:15.160]   Let's go back, study ABC."
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.300]   Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch, right?
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:27.180]   All Old Testament stuff, which all are destined to perish, right?
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.300]   In accordance to the commandments of teachings of men, these are just teachings of men.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.760]   This is not from God.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:42.780]   They have the appearance of wisdom and this is why this was so tempting.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:50.900]   They are made self-made religion and self-abasement with severe treatment to the body, but have
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.060]   no power against the flesh.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:33:05.700]   And the reason why this was so deceiving is because it's tangible, right?
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.300]   It's easy.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.020]   Just like anything else, right?
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:17.460]   If you want to lose weight, do these three things and don't do these three things, right?
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.500]   You want to get closer to God, do these three things, don't do these three things.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:28.260]   But the fundamental teaching of the gospel is you can't get to God like that, right?
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.300]   You can't get to God by making three-year plans.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:38.500]   You can't get to God by not watching certain programs and doing this and doing that, because
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.300]   all of that in and of itself has no power to change you.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.780]   It can change your appearance.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.140]   It can change the way you present yourself to people.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.960]   It can change the way that people look at you and say, "Oh, that guy is so disciplined.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.300]   That guy is so godly."
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.300]   But it doesn't do anything to change who you are, right?
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.620]   It has no power to change who you are.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.020]   So is discipline wrong?
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.520]   Of course not.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:10.620]   The Bible is filled with commandments to be disciplined, right?
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:14.420]   To run this race as to win, to buff up my body, make it my slave.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.700]   That's possibly after I preach so that I may be disqualified.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.860]   So the Bible tells us to be disciplined.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:28.020]   But the problem with their teaching was the discipline was what led them to God, right?
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.020]   And that was their problem.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:33.100]   That was the false teaching, that if you kept these commandments, kept these laws, that
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.740]   somehow they were gonna be righteous.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.500]   And that's what he's preaching against.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.460]   You have no power in and of yourself to do that, right?
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.780]   All of these things, they look like they have wisdom.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.700]   It's coming from traditions of men.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.580]   The self-made religion, right?
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.980]   If you think about it, in every religion, in every religion, the principle is pretty
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.640]   much the same.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.940]   In every religion, right?
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.860]   If you're good, outweigh the bad.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.900]   Good things are gonna happen to you.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.380]   If you do good things, right?
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.060]   You're gonna be rewarded with good things.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.860]   That's the fundamental teaching of every religion, right?
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.000]   What that good is, is different.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.080]   And what that reward is, is gonna be different.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.060]   But the principle's the same.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.700]   You work hard, be a good person, and good things will happen to you.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.220]   The gospel doesn't teach that.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.660]   The gospel is exactly the opposite of that.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.840]   You can be good all your life and stand condemned before God.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.040]   Your good is not good enough, right?
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   Because you can't change.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.860]   Can a leper change his spot?
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.220]   Can a sinner change his ways?
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.900]   You can't.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:50.300]   So the point of the gospel is that only Christ and what he has done, and when we receive
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:55.460]   it with faith, has the ability to transform us, right?
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.700]   He was in Christ.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.700]   He's a new creation.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.620]   The old has gone, behold, the new has come.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.620]   You become new.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.820]   That's why he says you have to be born again.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.660]   He doesn't say, "Hey, Nicodemus, you're great.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.860]   You're a student, but you need to be A plus."
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.940]   That's not what he says.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.420]   You have to die and be born again.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.660]   It's like, "How can a man be born again?
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.620]   Enter again to a mother's womb?"
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.340]   Yes.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.340]   Spiritually.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.540]   You need to be born again spiritually.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.620]   But even then, spiritually, like, "Well, how are you born again spiritually?"
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.780]   Well, the spirit is like the wind.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.820]   No one knows when it comes and when it goes, right?
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.820]   Wait a second.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:41.540]   I have to be born again of the spirit, but I have no way of knowing when it's coming,
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.100]   where it's going.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.580]   So how can a man be born again?
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.580]   You can't by your own effort.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.780]   It is by God's choice, right?
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.700]   God will do it, right?
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.740]   That was the point that he was trying to make.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:59.620]   And so all this self-work, again, one of the questions that I ask here for your discussion
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:08.980]   at the end, if you look at it, the third question, "If man-imposed discipline has no value against
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:14.780]   fleshly indulgence, what role does accountability and fellowship play in our sanctification?"
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:20.420]   So the mistake that we can make is, since all this, like, "Don't touch this," and "Don't
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.740]   do this," and all this is of the old covenant, right?
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.940]   These are elementary things, and the reality is found in Christ, then why do we need to
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:29.940]   be disciplined?
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:34.540]   Why do we have to go to church?
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.540]   Why do we have to give?
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.380]   Why do we have to do any of it?
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:44.180]   We just receive and forget about it, right?
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:49.100]   Is that what this passage teaches?
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.380]   Let me tell you, just so that you don't become a heretic.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.500]   No, that's not what it's teaching, okay?
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.140]   So then what does it teach?
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:02.220]   So I gave a few verses, instead of me having a discussion with you, I gave a few verses
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   for you guys to look at.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.980]   How do we reconcile the imperatives in the New Testament with what he says here?
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.240]   All of that, like, this self, you know, doing this, I'm not going to do this, I'm going
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   to do that.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:25.740]   Like, if all of that is false humility, it doesn't have the ability to change, right,
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:30.820]   to change the flesh, then what part does the discipline play?
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.540]   All right.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.180]   I'm taking a chance letting you discuss this.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.980]   So we've already, so all the small group leaders have been given the discussion questions ahead
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.780]   of time, okay?
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.260]   But I'll just give you the final answer.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.260]   No, it is not.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.260]   All right.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.340]   The imperatives are there for a reason.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.420]   But what role does it play?
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.660]   How do you reconcile this?
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:53.660]   Okay?
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:39:00.300]   So let me pray for us and then you guys can get into your group.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.200]   Heavenly Father, we pray for much wisdom.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.980]   We pray, Father God, that in a time of discussion that you would lead us deeper into understanding
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:20.220]   who you are, especially Lord God, as difficult as it is for us to leave behind our own flesh,
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:26.860]   desiring to have glory, to become somebody, to become better than who we are now.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.300]   We know, Lord God, that that's of the world.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:37.300]   Help us to recognize what it means to be crucified with Christ, to really embrace, to live a
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:42.420]   life, Lord God, that is hidden in him and eagerly waiting to be glorified when he comes
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.220]   with his glory.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:49.540]   Teach us what that means in a practical way, that it would not simply be theory, but the
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.860]   evidence and the testimony of our lives.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.100]   We pray for your guidance, Lord God, through our discussion.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.100]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.700]   Amen.
