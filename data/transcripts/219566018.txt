[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.380]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 10, I'm going to be reading the first
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.240]   four verses of chapter 10, but again, the main focus would be on the last verse, verse
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.240]   4.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.760]   Okay, Romans chapter 10, verses 1 through 4.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.360]   "Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.320]   For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.760]   For being ignorant of the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own, they
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.180]   did not submit to God's righteousness, for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.960]   to everyone who believes."
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.600]   Let's pray.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.360]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for an opportunity for the corporate body to come
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.040]   together to worship, to meet with you, to express our love.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.880]   We pray, Father God, that your word would truly go forth and that it is your voice that
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.520]   we are able to hear, that you would allow us to bear fruit as we hear, apply, and eager,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.640]   Lord God, to draw near to you.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.040]   So we pray for your blessing this time.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.120]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.920]   As you guys know, we've been studying through the book of Romans.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.080]   This is I think the third or fourth sermon on just these four verses.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.040]   The reason why I've been going really slow, every part of scripture is important, but
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.280]   there are certain things that Paul says in these four verses that if you miss what he
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.120]   says or you get a superficial understanding, you might miss the whole backbone or the foundation
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.120]   of Christianity.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's that important that you can attend church all your life, singing the songs, memorizing
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.160]   scripture, doing Bible study, maybe even serving as a Sunday school teacher, and at the end
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.800]   of the day you completely miss the whole point.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.040]   That's exactly what the Pharisees were guilty of.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.880]   They spent all their life paying attention to scripture.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.560]   Nobody paid more attention to scripture than the Pharisees.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.400]   And yet when Christ came, they completely missed him.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.700]   It wasn't just they missed a certain aspect of him, they completely missed him.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.520]   So it's important for us that we understand thoroughly what Paul is saying in Romans chapter
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.920]   10, and in particular this morning, looking at verse four, the emphasis that's there before
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.880]   we move on.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.360]   As you guys know, I'm Korean American, as if you didn't know, but I'm a Korean American,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.080]   and I remember when I first got saved, I got saved in a ministry where they were primarily
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.800]   Korean speakers.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.720]   And so my Korean is decent enough to get along, but not completely.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.600]   So they would sing songs and do Bible study in Korean, and I had to learn.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.560]   So my Korean actually improved.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.680]   And in that group, and again, this ministry was in K-town, and in that group I was the
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680]   banana.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.880]   And so all my friends would say, "Oh, he's yellow on the outside, but he's white in the
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.880]   inside."
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.680]   At this church, I'm the fop, complete opposite.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.100]   But I'm kind of right in the middle.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.960]   Sometimes people ask me, "Do you think in Korean?
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.560]   Do you think in English?"
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.280]   I would say majority of the time I think in English, but then sometimes I think in Korean.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.920]   And then when I'm thinking in Korean and speaking in English, that's when it comes up all jumbled
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.640]   up.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.760]   Years ago, typically I feel very comfortable in the English setting, because most of my
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.920]   life was raised in the United States.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.980]   But when I first started as a youth pastor at a Korean church, there was a lot of things
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.520]   about the culture that I just assumed and understood, but I was getting into some issues.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.080]   And I remember asking my father at that time, "There's just certain things about the Korean
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   culture that I don't understand."
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.000]   Well, one of the most practical advice that my dad gave me, serving as a youth pastor
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.400]   under a first-generation Korean church, he said, "If an elder in the church asks you
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.960]   to do something and you disagree, or you don't think you can do it, don't tell them no.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.240]   Tell them you'll think about it, and then don't get back to him."
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.120]   That was the advice he gave me.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.200]   So somebody being raised in the Western culture, I said, "That seems kind of disrespectful
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   or dishonest.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.720]   I should tell them that I can or cannot.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.280]   Let your yes be yes and no be no."
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.880]   And he said, "Trust me, that's how it works."
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.200]   That's what he told me.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.800]   So I just kind of like, "Okay."
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   I just heard it.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.400]   But a few months down the line, one of the elders came up to me.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.240]   Again, at that time, I was probably no more than 21 or 22 years old.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.920]   One of the elders came up to me and said, "He's taking a seminary class, and he's studying
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.880]   First Timothy, and he had to read it in English, but he had a hard time understanding."
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.360]   So he came to me and he said, "Peter, can you translate this in Korean for me?"
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.040]   It was a whole commentary on First Timothy.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   I said, "That would take me a whole year to do this."
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.800]   So obviously, my gut reaction is like, "Oh, no, of course I can't do that."
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.200]   And I remember what my dad told me, so I said, "Let me think about this."
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.400]   And then I didn't get back to him, just like my dad told me to.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.640]   And then obviously, a few weeks would go by, and then he would come back and he'd say,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.000]   "Hey, Peter, so what do you think?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Do you think you can do it?"
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.440]   It's like, "I'm still thinking about it.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.000]   Let me get back to you."
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.120]   And I just left it at that.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.040]   And then after a while, he would just walk by and look at me.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.320]   And then I would say nothing.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.800]   I would never bring it up.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.120]   And then it just passed.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   And so I had a hard time understanding that.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.000]   And I said, "The communication is not very clear."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.920]   And I remember talking to my dad about that, and he said, "It may not be clear to you,
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.880]   but it's clear to him."
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.400]   He said, "That's a way of saving face."
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.160]   In the Korean culture, instead of disobeying and saying, "No, I'm not going to do it,"
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.480]   you kind of have a submissive attitude, and it's a way to save face, and he gets the message.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   You've honored him.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.080]   You didn't embarrass him, but you didn't listen to him either, but just kind of way of just
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   kind of getting by.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.280]   Again, the reason why I share this is, anytime you try to function or communicate or do something
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.120]   in a different culture, you have to put in that culture's lens.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.320]   If you go to China, there are certain things about that culture that if you try to apply
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.440]   what you learned here and then try to apply it in the culture in China, you're going to
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.040]   have a difficult time.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.080]   Everything over there runs on guanxi, in relationship.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.480]   Here everything is about contract.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.960]   You agree, like how much is your part and how much is my part, and then we based upon
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.820]   contract, we agree, and then we move forward.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.760]   Over there, those contracts, they're still contract, but it's not as serious as the relationship.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.080]   As long as you have a great relationship, you can kind of go forward and get things
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   done.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.720]   It's the same things in India, that you kind of have to put on the cultural lens there
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.200]   in order to understand what's going on.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.120]   You can't just take from where I am and then just apply it to over there.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.400]   That's how a lot of missionaries make mistakes when they go overseas to do mission work.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.080]   The reason why I say all of this is because when we study the scripture, if we don't put
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.400]   on the lens of Christ, you can read the Bible and completely miss the whole point.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.600]   The whole of scripture, Old Testament, New Testament, all that has been written in the
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.640]   scripture, all of it was about Christ.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.480]   So if you read the Old Testament and it doesn't lead you to Christ, you've missed the whole
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   point of the Old Testament.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.320]   If you read the New Testament and you're studying and that doesn't lead you to Christ, then
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.680]   you've missed the whole point of that.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.000]   If we don't put on the lens of Christ in understanding and interpretation, and again, we're not trying
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.840]   to milk it, we're not trying to find Christ under every rock, but the more you study the
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.800]   word of God, you will see the connection that everything that has been written was about
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.720]   Christ.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.860]   The section that we're looking at this morning in verse 4, Paul says, "For Christ is the
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.920]   end of the law, for righteousness to everyone who believes."
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.520]   Those of you who were on the Facebook page last night, I usually try to give a couple
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.160]   questions for you to read before you come so that you can understand and know what's
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   going on in the text.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.880]   I only had one question yesterday, and that question was, when he says Christ is the end
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.680]   of the law, because the word "end" could mean various things in the English, does it mean
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.240]   that He is the goal of the law?
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.600]   Or does it mean He is the fulfillment of the law?
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.160]   Or does it mean that He is the termination of the law?
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   Because in English, the word "end" could be interpreted or understood or applied in all
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   of those ways.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.600]   Well, I don't think we need to dissect and say, well, that's what He means, because based
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.680]   upon the word and the context of what Paul is saying, He actually means all three.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.600]   So this morning, what we're going to do is we're going to look at all three different
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.400]   aspects of how Jesus Christ brought an end to the law.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.160]   So the first thing that we're going to look at, it says, "Christ is the end or intended
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.560]   purpose of the law."
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.040]   So I guess the way that we can understand it is in English when we say, to what end
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.440]   are you attending college?
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.120]   So when we say that, when I ask that, what do I mean by that?
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.560]   It means, what's your purpose?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.560]   What's your end goal?
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.020]   Well, I want to become a scientist, or I want to become a doctor or a lawyer.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.600]   But there's an end goal, right, end purpose.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.240]   Or maybe I would ask, for what end are you working so hard?
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.480]   Why are you working on the weekends?
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.960]   And why are you working extra hours?
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.840]   And why are you doing this and that?
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.360]   And the question is, for what purpose?
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.560]   What is your end goal?
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.800]   The word that is translated for end is telos.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.440]   And again, one of the meanings behind that, it's the end purpose.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.420]   It's the whole purpose and goal.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:07.480]   So Paul uses that same word in 1 Timothy 1.5, where he says, "The aim of our charge is love."
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.360]   Paul is giving instruction to this young pastor, saying that this is how you ought to pastor
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   the church.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.280]   You need to focus on the word, how to establish elders and deacons in the church.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.720]   And he's giving instructions how to be a good pastor at the Church of Ephesus.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.880]   But he begins by reminding him that all the commandments that I'm giving you, the end
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.120]   goal of all of the commands and all of your ministry is love.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.540]   In fact, in NIV, the word is translated goal.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.960]   The goal of all my charge is love.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.200]   And again, that word for goal or aim in that passage is the same word that we're using
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:48.080]   here when it says, "Christ is the end, telos of the law."
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.760]   Meaning all of it.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.480]   Everything that you have been studying up to this point was to bring you to Christ.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.320]   And that's what it says in John 5.39, "You search the scriptures because you think that
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:04.840]   in them you have eternal life, and it is they that bear witness about me."
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:11.200]   Jews studied the Old Testament much more diligently than an average Christian in our generation.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.840]   They memorized the scripture left and right.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.320]   They could quote you certain passages in the Old Testament by the time they were 80 years
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.280]   old.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.720]   They knew the scriptures and they applied the scriptures.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.860]   They studied the scriptures.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.100]   But Jesus says, "You're looking into them thinking that somehow if you study it and
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.720]   apply it that you're going to find life."
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.880]   And Jesus says, "No, all of that was about me."
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.080]   All of that, everything that you studied, you completely missed the point because all
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.880]   of it was about me.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.820]   Again, he says in Luke 24.27, "And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.380]   to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself."
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.720]   When Jesus says scripture here, clearly he's speaking about the Old Testament because the
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.440]   New Testament canon has not been put together yet.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.020]   He said, "All of it was about me."
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.060]   So you remember last week, Pastor Aaron went through a list of all the different Old Testament
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.920]   books and how all of that relates to and points to Christ because that's exactly what it was
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.560]   for.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.660]   All the prophets ultimately was to bring us to Christ.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.440]   Israel's history was to bring us to Christ.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.960]   All of the poetry was to point us to Christ.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.460]   Well how did it do that?
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:34.600]   In Galatians 3.24, Paul says, "So then the law was our guardian until Christ came in
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.860]   order that we might be justified by faith."
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:43.480]   The word for guardian in Greek literally means a teacher of children.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.700]   Someone who guides and leads children for a particular purpose.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.460]   So if you're an elementary school teacher, maybe you're teaching them to pass the standardized
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.660]   test.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.000]   If you're a junior high school student, your end goal is to prepare them for college maybe.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.740]   If you're a college professor, your end goal is to help them find a job or maybe get to
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.920]   the next level.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.740]   But there's a clear end goal.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.700]   And as a teacher, he said that the law was given to teach and to guide, to take you to
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.720]   a certain point.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.380]   And that point, Paul clearly says, was Christ.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.480]   In Romans 7.7, again he iterates, "What then shall we say?
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.360]   That the law is sin?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.420]   By no means.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.520]   Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:37.200]   I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, 'You shall not covet.'"
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.280]   Charles Spurgeon, speaking of this particular passage and on this subject of the law being
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   a guide, he says this.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.960]   And I think the quote is going to be up here.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.880]   "The law is a sheriff's officer to shut men up in prison for their sin, concluding them
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.440]   all under condemnation, in order that they may look to the free grace of God alone for
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.660]   deliverance.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.580]   This is the object of the law.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:06.260]   It empties that grace may fill and wounds that mercy may heal."
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:11.900]   Everything that we have been studying, all of it was to bring us closer to Christ.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:17.860]   Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1, he says all of the Old Testament was simply a shadow of the
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.980]   good things to come and the reality is found in Christ.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:29.820]   Everything that we know of the Old Testament, all of Israel's history, the sacrificial system,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:38.900]   the kings, the prophets, poetry, all of them, narratives, wisdom literature, he says all
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.100]   of it was simply a shadow of what was to come.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.900]   It was to prepare us to cause this longing for this person to come.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.460]   And that's why it says in 1 Peter that when the angels, or 2 Peter, when the angels were
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.940]   prophesying about these things, they longed to look into it to see who is going to fulfill
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.940]   this.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.940]   You know, I remember years ago in college, they used to play this game where they would
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.460]   take a picture of a student and they would just show the outline or the shadow.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.540]   And the game was to try to guess who this person is.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.020]   So they would put it up and then they would say, "Oh, I think it's this person," or,
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.020]   "I think it's that person."
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.460]   But that's the nature of the shadow.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.500]   A shadow is whenever you see it, you don't look at that and say, "Oh, I met that person."
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.660]   The shadow, immediately you see it, the first question that you have is, "Who is this a
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.100]   shadow of?"
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.060]   So if you're standing somewhere in the middle of nowhere and you see a shadow of somebody
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.500]   behind you, your first instinct is to turn around to see who it is.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.860]   And you look at the shadow and the shadow is massive, right?
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.300]   Has a strange hair.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.340]   And so depending on the kind of shadow you have, you say, "Wow, who is this person?"
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.340]   And you want to turn around.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:52.500]   See, that was the whole purpose of the law, is to cast a shadow so that when we looked
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.020]   upon the shadow, it would cause us to say, "Who is this?
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:01.440]   Who's going to come and take away our sins?
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.480]   Who's going to be the king of kings, an everlasting king, where his throne is going to last forever
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   and ever?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.860]   Who's going to restore the remnant of Israel for eternity?
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.780]   Who's going to be the king above all kings?"
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:25.620]   All of that was a shadow to cause us to long for the coming of Christ.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:31.820]   For Christ to be the end of the law means that sacrifices ultimately was to bring us
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.820]   to Christ.
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.040]   In and of itself, there is no forgiveness of sins.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:44.320]   It was an act of obedience to prepare them, to teach them that there was a need for blood
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.180]   sacrifice which ultimately Christ was going to fulfill.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.800]   The sacrifices were given to them as a shadow to cause them to long for the coming of Christ.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.080]   The cities of refuge in the Old Testament.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:05.320]   God creates six cities, not a building, not an altar, whole cities.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.160]   Simply so that somebody who killed somebody by accident and their family members would
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.880]   be angry and then they would chafe acid and kill them just to give them a place to go
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.320]   and hide for safety.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.520]   Six whole cities.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.280]   And they call this the city of refuge.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:29.760]   And he created this city of refuge as a shadow to point that Christ ultimately is our refuge.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.440]   He went through all of that drama so that there would be a longing to see who's going
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.800]   to fulfill this.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.880]   The promise of the promised land ultimately was about Christ.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.880]   In Hebrews chapter 11 it says, "If the promised land was a physical land, all these people
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.240]   who suffered to get there could have easily just turned around and gone home.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.120]   But the promise that God made to them was not about here.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.760]   And that's why these people by faith were able to reach the promised land and that promised
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.640]   land was Christ."
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.840]   Even the idea of rewards and inheritances that we see in the book of Numbers.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.400]   That all of this was to be fulfilled in Christ.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.640]   That Christ is our reward.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.480]   He is our inheritance.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.800]   Imagine how significant the Sabbath is in the Old Testament.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.920]   That keeping the Sabbath was so significant.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.120]   What they could do, what they could not do.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.680]   I think there's a reason why the Pharisees took this law so seriously.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.240]   Because it is so emphasized in the Old Testament.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.160]   But remember what Jesus says to the Pharisees when they accuse him, "Why are you breaking
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   the Sabbath?"
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.440]   He says, "I'm not breaking the Sabbath.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.640]   Jesus never broke the Sabbath.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.400]   He broke their tradition.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.360]   You think that the Sabbath was made for us to obey."
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   He says, "The Sabbath?
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.440]   Man was not made for Sabbath."
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.760]   He says, "The Sabbath was made for man."
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.480]   The whole purpose of the Sabbath was to teach about rest that was going to be fulfilled
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.520]   in Christ.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.120]   That only in Christ that we will ultimately find Sabbath.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.680]   That's why Jesus says, "Come to me all who are weary and heavy and laden and I will give
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   you rest."
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.120]   I will give you Sabbath.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.480]   All of the Old Testament was to bring us to Christ.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.040]   And all of the New Testament is to keep us in Christ.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.520]   That's why out of the seven "I am" statements, the last "I am" statement in the book of John
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.080]   where Jesus says, "I am the vine."
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:32.120]   If you want to bear fruit, if you want to live, you have to remain in me.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.280]   That's why all of the Old Testament is preparation for the coming of Christ.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.520]   And all of the New Testament is to teach us and point us so that we do not drift away
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.320]   from Christ.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.720]   If you remember when Jesus was going to the cross, Satan did everything in his power to
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.800]   keep Jesus from the cross.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.680]   Whether it was through the leaders of Israel or people rejecting him.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.080]   And then he used Peter by influencing him saying, "You can't go."
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.760]   Jesus said, "Get behind me."
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.160]   And he actually enters into Judas and betrays him.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.200]   And yet now on this side of the cross, the primary work of Satan is to keep us from drifting
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.600]   away from him.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.600]   Is to make sure that we don't remain in him.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.080]   That we keep drifting.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.200]   Satan is not afraid of large churches.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:29.120]   You can have people gather together in large numbers with all the resources and commitment.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.520]   That's not where the power lies.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.120]   The reason why the gathering of the church, there's power, is because Christ is in the
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.760]   midst.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.960]   When we are fixated on Christ, when people who are in love with Christ are gathered
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.360]   together, whether it's two or three, there's power.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:55.520]   You can have a church, a mega church, and yet busy doing God's work.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.200]   Fellowship.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.040]   We attach the word fellowship to anything that Christians gather to do.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.700]   Christians play basketball, it's basketball fellowship.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.000]   We play softball, it's softball fellowship.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.880]   We go rock climbing, it's rock climbing fellowship.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.360]   We watch MMA together, it's MMA fellowship.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.400]   We just attach fellowship to anything that the Christians gather to do.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.760]   All that we have been called to do is to point to Christ.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.100]   So if our fellowship doesn't point to Christ, that's not fellowship.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.280]   If our Bible study doesn't point to Christ, then that's not Bible study.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.440]   If our prayer meeting doesn't push us toward Christ, then that's not a prayer meeting.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.040]   That's meditation.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.120]   Everything that we are to do, everything that God has done and everything we are to do is
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.680]   to bring us to Christ because the end goal is Christ.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.920]   The end goal of worship is to love Christ.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.680]   The end goal of our gathering is to stimulate us toward Christ.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.840]   That's what he means when he says Christ is the end of the law.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:07.600]   All that striving and working and sacrificing, the end goal is Christ.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.680]   Second thing that he says, that Christ is the fulfillment of the law.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   Matthew 5.17 says, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.080]   I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them."
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:24.320]   The word for fulfill is the same word that we find in Ephesians, the word pleru, to be
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.340]   filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.400]   It means to fill up in something.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.280]   Not just partially, but to its maximum end, to fulfill.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:40.320]   And that's why in Matthew 3.15, when Jesus comes to get baptized by John the Baptist,
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.800]   obviously John's whole purpose was to prepare the way for Christ.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.080]   So here's his master coming who says, "Sandals, I'm unworthy to even tie."
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.600]   He says, "Why would you be baptized by me?
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   I should baptize you."
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.400]   Remember what Jesus says?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:01.120]   He says, "I need to be baptized now to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.500]   In other words, even Christ, he submitted himself to obey all of God's commands.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.000]   God did not break any of its commands.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.320]   He fulfilled all of it.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.600]   Why did he do that?
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.520]   In Romans 8.3-4, it says, "For God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.260]   do by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin he condemned
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.260]   sin in the flesh."
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.260]   Why?
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:27.920]   "In order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:33.540]   not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.980]   We could not fulfill the law, to its fullest.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.460]   Again, we have a tendency that if we're righteous about some area, we tend to highlight our
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.780]   righteousness and we minimize our unrighteousness.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.220]   You might be a compassionate person who's feeding the homeless, but you don't pray
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.460]   enough.
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.860]   You might have great friends and you're very hospitable, but you can't tolerate
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.300]   anybody who has different opinions.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.300]   Every single one of us has unrighteousness.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:08.220]   We have unrighteousness in some areas and unrighteousness in some areas, but it is not
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.500]   full.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.460]   And as Jesus says, if you break one commandment, you're a breaker of commandment of all of
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.380]   them.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.260]   Only Christ completely filled the law.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.260]   And the reason why he filled the law, the scripture says, "In order that the righteous
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:30.940]   requirement of the law that needed to be filled, he filled, so that we may gain his righteousness."
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:37.340]   That's why in John chapter 19, 30, the last words of Jesus on the cross where he says,
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.020]   "It is finished."
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.820]   And that word for finished is teleo.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.820]   That's the same word where he says, "The end," telos.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.680]   The same root word.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.020]   He says, "It is finished.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.460]   It is fulfilled.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.940]   Everything that the law required of me, I have fulfilled.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.820]   And everything that is required in order to atone for your sins," he says, "It is
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.820]   fulfilled."
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.500]   That's what he meant when he says, "It is finished."
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.500]   He wasn't simply saying that his life is done and that it's over.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.380]   He said, "Everything that was required for salvation has been done."
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.460]   That's why he says in Hebrews 10, 14, "For by a single offering he has perfected for
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.340]   all time those who are being sanctified."
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.020]   The word perfected here is also teleo.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.020]   The same root word.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.180]   The finished, fulfilled work of Christ.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:33.940]   There is nothing more that needs to be done to be declared righteous.
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:39.180]   There is nothing more that needs to be done for salvation of mankind.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:45.060]   And all the requirement that was needed to reconcile mankind to God was fulfilled in
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.140]   Christ.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.180]   There is nothing more that's going to happen in history.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.860]   There's nothing more that we need today.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.620]   Everything that we need for life of Godliness has been fulfilled in Christ.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.380]   That's what that means when he says, "Christ is the end of the law."
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:06.980]   And third and finally, "Christ is the termination of the law."
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.980]   Termination of the law.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.180]   Before we jump into what does that mean?
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.140]   What was terminated?
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.980]   Let me explain what it does not mean.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.380]   Because whenever we talk about justification by faith and Christ is the end of the law,
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.260]   a lot of people take that and then misapply it to mean that therefore there is no law.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.500]   We can do whatever we want.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.860]   And any law that says, "Hey, you should do this and you should come to church and
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.980]   you should do this," and all of a sudden you're all legalists because Christ is the
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.980]   end of the law.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.460]   It's been terminated.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.620]   That is not what that means.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.180]   And Romans 3.31 says, "Do we then overthrow the law by this faith?"
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.220]   By no means.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.380]   On the contrary, we uphold the law.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:55.540]   Salvation by faith and justification by faith alone does not mean, therefore, what God commands,
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.420]   the imperatives have been nullified.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.940]   Jesus was constantly being accused.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.300]   Why do you disobey the law?
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.420]   Why do you break the commandments?
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.980]   Again, Jesus never broke the commandments.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.180]   He broke their tradition, but they were accusing him of breaking the commandments.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:17.180]   And Jesus answered in Matthew 5.17.19, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.660]   law or the prophets.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.540]   I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.620]   For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.180]   from the law until all is accomplished.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.460]   Therefore, whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.660]   do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.540]   them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:49.460]   There is a temptation that when we talk about justification by faith alone, for whatever
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.180]   the reason, people begin to embrace antinomianism, meaning like, "Okay, you know, we want to
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.220]   minimize the imperatives in the Bible, the commands in the Bible, because it's all been
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.020]   fulfilled in Christ."
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.980]   J.I. Packer actually writes a concise theology about this particular issue.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:11.780]   Antinomianism is basically antinomos, meaning no law or against the law.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:18.580]   That's a false heresy or heresy in the Christian community where there is no commandment.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:24.180]   As long as I love Jesus, as long as I have this belief in Jesus, all this stuff doesn't
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.180]   matter.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.340]   He lists five different ways that people embrace antinomianism.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.660]   So I think it's up there.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:38.420]   So number one, dualistic antinomianism is associated with a Gnosticism which treats
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.860]   the body and its actions as insignificant.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.740]   Now we've been talking about how the Christian Gnostics and how they perverted the gospel
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.260]   and the whole book of 1 John is written about this.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:55.740]   If you think that because we're saved by grace and what we do in the flesh doesn't
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.380]   matter and he says he who is not living in light, you fool yourself because God is light
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.180]   and there is no fellowship with darkness and in light.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:09.260]   So whole 1 John is written to combat this Gnostic antinomianism.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:17.020]   And a lot of people, again, in our generation embrace this because it justifies an antinomian
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.060]   life.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.900]   It frees us to do whatever we want and anybody who says you shouldn't do this or you should
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:27.300]   do this, you say, oh, that's against the gospel.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   Second thing he mentions is spirit-centered antinomianism which views the inner promptings
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:37.220]   of the spirit as sufficient apart from external word.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.220]   Spirit-centered antinomianism, again, according to J.I.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:45.100]   Packer, is where, again, this typically happens in some of the charismatic circles, not all,
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.820]   but some of the charismatic circles where the inward impression of God has a higher
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.900]   value than the word.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.200]   I remember years ago I was doing Bible study and we were talking about how God calls us
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.820]   to the great commission and disciple making and sharing the gospel and she just flat out
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.540]   told me, I don't think that's what God wants from me.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.180]   I said, what?
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.980]   She said, yeah, I know, but the scripture says, it's like I know what the scripture
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:15.500]   says but God understands where I am, who I am, and I don't think God really wants that
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.940]   from me.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.940]   How do you know this?
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.460]   It's because I just know.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.840]   The spirit is telling me.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.660]   What he means by a spirit-centered antinomianism is we nullify all the commandments of God
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.140]   based upon whatever impression.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.820]   So we can just kind of live our life willy-nilly based upon however we feel at that moment.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:44.100]   We can nullify any kind of commandment, because I feel different toward that.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:53.580]   Third, and I'm not going to linger too long on it, but third one is the most deceptive.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.980]   J. I. Packer says there's a Christ-centered antinomianism which argues that God sees no
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:03.460]   sin in believers because they are in Christ who kept the law for them and therefore what
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:08.260]   they actually do makes no difference provided that they keep believing.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.940]   This is the most confusing of them because it is Christ-centered.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   It leads us to Christ.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:18.340]   As long as I believe Christ in my heart that we emphasize what he has done and what we
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.900]   do really doesn't matter.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.340]   No one could become righteous by their own merit so our righteousness doesn't matter.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.260]   And in essence it leads to antinomianism because it doesn't matter.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.500]   Well if it doesn't matter how do we choose elders?
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.580]   How do we disciple people?
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.660]   How do we determine if somebody is righteous or not?
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.780]   How do we even practice church discipline if it doesn't matter as long as somebody says
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.700]   I believe?
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:55.420]   Christ-centered antinomianism is embraced because it justifies our sins.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.540]   Not Christ, but this false sense of security.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:04.140]   Fourth, dispensational antinomianism which denies that in the church age believers are
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.820]   obligated to, or not obligated to the moral law.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.460]   I'm not going to get too deep into that because it requires too much explanation.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:18.500]   Fifthly, situationist antinomianism which teaches that love is the only rule that duties,
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.460]   not just their application, will therefore vary according to circumstance.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.940]   And again, it's about love.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.060]   So all this other stuff really doesn't matter.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.240]   Again I'm not going to go too deep into that.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.100]   But each one of these things are false ways that we embrace a life that chases after the
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.820]   world and says, you know what, all these imperatives don't matter.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.700]   But in the end, it's antinomian.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:47.980]   When there is a guilt in the life of a Christian, the purpose of that guilt is to bring us to
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.460]   Christ.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.980]   Because the only resolution to that guilt is repentance and receive mercy and forgiveness
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.460]   from this faithful God who sent his only begotten son.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.760]   So that guilt is placed there.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:05.060]   But if we don't deal with that guilt in repentance, the only other way to deal with that guilt
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:10.220]   is to change our theology so that we no longer feel guilty.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.340]   And we have various ways, again, I don't think it's limited to these five, but we have various
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.740]   ways to change our theology so that it is acceptable to live a life that does not look
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.620]   anything according to scripture.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.200]   And yet we have absolute confidence.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:30.020]   That is not what he means when he says Christ is the end of the law.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.940]   First Timothy 1.8, it says, now we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:42.300]   The unlawful use of the law is to use it to justify your sins or justify yourself before
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   God.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:51.540]   The lawful use of the law is an individual who uses it for profit, for training in righteousness,
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.620]   for reproof, for correction, for teaching that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.620]   for every good work.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:04.000]   I just quoted 2 Timothy 3.16-17 where Paul tells Timothy to stick to his word, to preach
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.720]   his word in season and out of season, whether people want to listen or don't listen, because
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.600]   I've ordained my word.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:17.540]   And when he says all scripture, is he talking about the New Testament or Old Testament?
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.600]   The New Testament canon hasn't been written yet when he was writing 2 Timothy.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.780]   He's talking about Old Testament scripture, that all of it is profitable.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:31.560]   He's talking as a man on this side of the covenant with Christ crucified and resurrected.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:39.460]   So when he says that all scripture is profitable for teaching, for training, for reproof, he's
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.700]   not saying that the law has ended.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.540]   There's no need for us to worry about pursuing Christ and pursuing holiness.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.900]   That is not what that means.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.780]   But let me tell you what it does mean.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:35:00.580]   The law, as it pertains to our need to be justified for our sins, has been made complete
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.320]   in Christ.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.700]   In the Old Testament, God commanded these sacrifices.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.220]   And they were absolutely necessary to approach God.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.900]   There was burnt offering, whole offering, grain offering.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.180]   They had sin offering, guilt offering.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:24.880]   They had these major offerings and every single individual who wanted to come to God had to
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.100]   make these sacrifices in order to atone for their sins.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.340]   So they were mandatory sacrifices in the Old Testament to get to God.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:39.180]   Well that mandatory sacrifice has been complete, has been terminated in Christ because he fulfilled
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.880]   it.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.500]   There is no more thing that needs to be done in order for us to get to God.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.180]   It has been made complete.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:53.420]   Romans 7, 6, "But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:59.780]   captive so that we serve not under the old written code, but in the new life of the Spirit.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:06.060]   Sin no longer," in Romans 6, 14, "has dominion over you, since you are not under law, but
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.820]   under grace."
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.340]   There is no barrier between us and God.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:16.180]   And the reason why there is no barrier between us and God is because that mediation that
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:21.460]   we needed, the sacrifice and the priesthood and the temple, all of that has been terminated
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.580]   in Christ.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.660]   And that's why he invites us to enter the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:34.220]   Not because you prayed, not because you read the Bible, not because you're serving or giving,
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:40.460]   but because Christ has completed what is necessary for us to come to him.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:46.860]   Even when you are deep in sin, there is no barrier between you and God.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.180]   Even when you are filled with guilt, there is no barrier, there is no other mediator
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.900]   but in Christ.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:59.220]   And all of that that was necessary before has been terminated in Christ.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.740]   And that's why Christ can call us to come to him.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.420]   Come to him.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.940]   Those of you who were righteous this week, come to him.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.300]   Those of you who are struggling in purity, come to him.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.860]   Those of you who are lost, come to him.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.220]   There is no barrier between you and God.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.940]   There is no mediator necessary.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:27.180]   Everything that we are doing, everything that we are studying, every song that we sing is
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.280]   to constantly remind us, it is finished.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.480]   It is finished.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.700]   It has been made complete.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.300]   We often evaluate the church and we say, in order for missions to happen, we need more
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.300]   training.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:49.260]   We need more men of God who are equipped.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.260]   We need more funding.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.420]   We don't have enough funding.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.040]   We need people who have money in the church who are going to fund these mission work.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.140]   We need a better strategy because the strategy of the past generation did not work.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.060]   I don't see any of that in Scripture.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:11.580]   Anything that I see that Christ reminds us over and over again, that if you want to bear
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:19.780]   fruit, if you want to live, he says, remain in me.
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.360]   Remain in me.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.740]   If you want to evangelize, remain in me.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:30.560]   If you want to be effective in fellowship, remain in me.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.120]   If you want to understand Scripture, remain in me.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.860]   If you want to bear fruit, it says, remain in me.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.780]   All of the Old Testament pointed us to Christ.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:44.220]   All of the New Testament is to keep us in Christ.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:52.100]   You know, oftentimes the burden that I have, I've been a pastor at this church 20 years,
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.020]   and some of you I've known longer than that.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:00.620]   And sometimes I think, they must be sick of me by now.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.980]   There's nothing I can say that they haven't heard.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.300]   And those of you who are new don't know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.340]   Because you haven't heard my jokes before, so they're new to you.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:14.380]   There's a group of people here that has been hearing me speak for the last 15 years,
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.960]   some of you even longer than that.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.260]   And I think humanly speaking, what could I possibly say?
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.460]   I've studied through Romans and quoted the passages, studied through the Old Testament,
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.800]   the New Testament.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.860]   What could I possibly say that's going to sound anything new?
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:35.860]   So usually when I go to another church to speak, I have 20-some years of sermons I can
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.340]   gather together, and it's like, here it is.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:46.220]   But a church, there's nothing, humanly speaking, that I can say that's going to get you excited
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.220]   about anything.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.580]   Oh yeah, we're going to do community work.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.580]   Yeah, we did that before.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.580]   How about missions?
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   Yeah, yeah, we've been there.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.580]   We've done that.
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.900]   You know, a prayer meeting.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.860]   We used to do Friday prayer meeting all the time.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.860]   How about morning prayer?
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.860]   We used to do that.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.740]   And all of that gets old after a while.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:09.100]   Human effort, organization, programs, even the stuff coming out of my mouth, you know,
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.100]   how many times?
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:15.460]   Like, I get sick of it.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.580]   I've been preaching regularly since I was 19.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.140]   I shouldn't have been, but I did, since I was 19.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.780]   My former youth pastor kind of pushed me into ministry, and I said, "Okay," and then that's
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.700]   what happened.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:36.620]   I can say, in all honesty, it's been 30 years that I've been preaching and doing ministry
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.900]   and discipling and doing all this stuff.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:50.020]   This is one quality of a person that kind of is an indicator that that person will persevere.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.740]   There's one indicator.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.660]   And that indicator always, to me, was the love for the Word.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.160]   There's a love for the Word of God.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.100]   But ultimately, it's not even the love for the Word.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.100]   It's love for the Word.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.780]   Like, why does somebody love the Word?
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.140]   Somebody could love the Word for all different reasons.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.660]   Somebody could love the Word because they love theology or they're trying to just gain
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.700]   knowledge and show off to people.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.540]   So it's not just love for the Word.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.700]   There is a genuine love for the Word because there's an affection for Christ, and they're
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.380]   looking into the Word because they want to connect with Christ.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.540]   That's one thing that I have seen in the 30 years, people coming and going.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:30.580]   It's not passion for missions or social justice or learning all these theological terms or
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.100]   going to seminary or doing all this stuff.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:39.380]   There's one thing that was universally true of every person that I saw that matured and
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:46.300]   persevered and bore fruit, one season of their life to the next season and to the next season.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.660]   I know a lot of people who are passionate when they're in college, and they fizzle out
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.020]   by the time they become young adults.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.660]   A lot of people are passionate young adults, as soon as they get married, they fizzle out.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.700]   A lot of people who are passionate when they're newly married, and they fizzle out after they
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.060]   have kids.
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.820]   Some of them are passionate in their 20s, but not in their 30s, or 30s, and not in their
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.580]   40s, and it just kind of fizzles out.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:12.620]   But there's one quality over and over and over and over again that is consistent.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.020]   Is there an affection for Christ?
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:21.420]   There's an affection for Christ that causes them to want to study the Bible.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.460]   There's an affection for Christ that causes them to want to serve the church.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.420]   And it doesn't matter if anybody else loves them or not, because they do.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.380]   Some of you love Lakers, right?
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.060]   I do.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:41.100]   If I want to have a conversation with you that's not going to end, I just say, "Lakers,"
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:45.580]   and boom, we have fellowship.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.140]   It's different when we talk about Lakers.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.940]   It's not like talking about something else.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.060]   There's passion.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.420]   There's knowledge.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.220]   There's hope.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.820]   There's disappointment.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.260]   And all of this comes together because we're Lakers fans.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.880]   Some of you guys like traveling, so we talk about traveling.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.660]   There's a different tone.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:11.340]   There's a different energy about it when we talk about things that you love.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:17.700]   I see this one quality that brings a person through in-season and out-of-season is their
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.700]   connection to Christ.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.700]   It's not their wealth.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.700]   It's not their talent.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.180]   It's not their experience.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.740]   It's not their knowledge.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.760]   God broke into our pride.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.440]   He humbled us.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:42.160]   And we came to a point where we realized that we can't make it without Him.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:46.340]   So Christ became our refuge.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.280]   He became our reward.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.560]   He became our inheritance.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.400]   And ultimately, He became our life.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:02.900]   So there's a lot of people I can talk about theology, church, mission.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:10.680]   But those who love Christ, there's a different tone when we talk about Jesus.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.240]   There's a different energy when we mention His name.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.680]   Because just the mention of His name brings you hope.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.520]   Just the mention of His name gives you comfort.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.720]   Because He drew you to Himself.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:34.760]   When He says Christ is the end of the law, that's what He means.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.360]   All of it.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.640]   Everything about you, everything about me, everything about the Old Testament, everything
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.100]   about the church was about Christ.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:53.200]   So if we can come to church year after year, decade after decade, and your love for Christ
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.700]   is never increasing, then you have missed the whole point.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.700]   I pray that that would not be the case.
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:07.740]   I pray whatever distraction there is in our life, that we would be able to say with confidence,
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:12.980]   and that this is not just some theological statement, but our testimony, Christ is the
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:18.060]   end of the law for my righteousness, for those who believe.
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:22.220]   Before we take some time to pray, let's sing this song in Christ alone.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:26.140]   And as we sing this song, look at the lyrics, and make that our confession before God.
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:30.140]   And after that, our praise team will ask us to take some time to pray.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:33.660]   But before we do that, let's take some time to meditate as we sing this song in Christ
