[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Alright, we're looking at Colossians chapter 2, 1 through 8. And, you know, I've had some
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.800]   conversations with people in this Bible study, and I know for some of you who've never done
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.560]   inductive Bible study, this is a lot. Alright, those of you who've never, you know, if you
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.360]   haven't been in the habit of reading the Bible, and all of a sudden you jump in asking questions,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:35.280]   and cross-referencing, and it's a lot. But, it's kind of like exercising, right? If you
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.360]   haven't exercised for a long time, your muscle hurts, and it's tiring, but in the long run,
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.560]   it's good for you, right? And so, getting in the habit of studying the Bible is not just important,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.040]   it is essential. It is essential to your walk with God, because if you don't learn how to eat
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.720]   spiritual food, you will always be dependent upon somebody else to feed you. So, if you happen to
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.400]   be around other people who are encouraging you, strengthening you, then you're doing okay. But,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.200]   as soon as those people disappoint you, or something goes wrong, you're in the pits,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.800]   right? And so, you can't live your Christian life always hitched to somebody else feeding you. And
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.560]   so, this is absolutely, this is not just important, it is essential for your walk with God, right? And,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.000]   obviously, Apostle Paul even mentions that about not being persuaded with persuasiveness of speech.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.600]   And so, it's constantly coming in where there's a deliberate attack for you to stray in your mind,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.880]   and your thinking, and your life. So, if that's where you are, you're not walking with God,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.000]   you probably don't even notice that that's happening. But, if you're even somewhat interested
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.600]   in trying to pursue God, you'll probably have already noticed that there is a constant pressure
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   and attack, or even subtle, that's coming in to cause you to stray, right? And so, again,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.320]   I can't emphasize enough why this is so important, okay? And, I've also had some conversation with
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.480]   you guys where, you know, you've read the Bible, and maybe you've even memorized, but you've never
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.000]   studied the Bible in this way before. And, I'm hoping that some of you will share the same
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.440]   sentiment. It is a world of difference between hearing a sermon and giving you insights that
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.000]   I've received, and just kind of spoon-feeding you, and coming back saying, "Oh, I'm really
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.200]   encouraged by that," than you searching and finding treasures for yourselves, right? So,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.760]   how many of you find that? It's just a completely different insight, completely different impact.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.200]   Just raise your hand. Show other people. Okay? World of difference, right? So, if you're able
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.120]   to—I remember, I shared this before, but I remember the first time just in the library,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.000]   just starting through Thessalonians, and the insight that I was able to gain on my own. And,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   all of a sudden, it really felt like I had three eyes, and one of my eyes got open. I wasn't using
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.520]   it for all that time, and all of a sudden, it just—I had a completely different perspective
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.080]   of the world, that I was able to come to the Word of God. And, it's different hearing from
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.480]   somebody, "God said this," versus hearing from God directly, right? Because that's what it feels
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.840]   like when you gain insight from the Word of God, and God begins to speak to you directly from God's
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.400]   Word. Okay? So, even though it's tedious, and it may be difficult, and you do have to do some work
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.520]   in order to gain things out of it, it is a world of difference in your walk with God to be able to
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.720]   come to the Word and find insights on your own. Okay? So, let me pray for us, and we'll jump right
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:43.320]   in. Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing. I know that some of us here come from a full day
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.520]   of work, and we may be physically tired, but we pray that your living Word would constantly
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.200]   recalibrate our thoughts and our spirits, that we may have an eternal perspective, that we would
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.280]   not live day to day in the grind, and just caught up with the rest of the world, Lord God, and
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.620]   allowing year to year just go by. Help us to be purposeful. Help us, Lord God, live consistent
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.440]   with the faith that we profess. Help us to gain insight from your Word, that we may know who you
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.320]   are, and to follow you with all our hearts. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. All right. So, the first
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.680]   thing, if you look at the questions that I gave you, and again this is just kind of help you, guide
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.920]   you through some of the things that that I'll be going over, but the first thing every week, just
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.520]   to kind of give you some guidance, it says look for repeated words, similar words, and ideas in
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.880]   the immediate area to get an idea of the thought flow of the writer. Okay? So, as you are studying
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.240]   this, before you ask questions, as you are reading this, that's probably the first thing that you
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.800]   should be doing. Right? What are words that are repeated here? What are phrases that are repeated?
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.200]   What are, look for words that connect ideas or conclude ideas from one thought to another. Right?
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.160]   You should be circling these, highlighting these, connecting these, because it'll help you get the
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   thought flow of the writer. You understand what I'm saying? And that's why I divided the verses in
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.960]   the way that I did. Right? Instead of just giving you verse by verse 1, verse 2, verse 3, verse 4, I
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.920]   try to break it down into the thought flow, so you can clearly see that this is his main point, this
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.400]   is his sub point, and then therefore he transitions into this, and this sentence leads to these
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.880]   thoughts. So that while you are reading it, you clearly see the outline of what he's saying. Right?
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.280]   What's the point, what's a sub point, and what is his supporting argument? Right? So, these are things
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.760]   that I told you that every time if I do Bible study, prepare for sermons, I do this first, and
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.720]   then I go back and look for repeated words or phrases or transitional phrases, and then once
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.800]   I start circling these things, it's pretty clear what he's trying to get at. Right? And then once
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.120]   I get the outline of his thoughts, then I can go back and start asking questions. What did he mean
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.280]   by that? Why did he say this? And clearly he's saying this, and it concludes over here, but if
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.520]   you, before you get all of that, and you jump in, and why did he mean this, you're asking a question
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.560]   outside the context that you don't understand yet. You understand? Okay? So you have to understand the
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.320]   context before you jump in to the text. That's why we do a broad study, chapter study, and then, and
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.360]   then you have smaller divisions like one through eight, but even within the smaller divisions,
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.840]   there are paragraphs, and there's ideas. So you want to break that down before you start to get
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.800]   into, because it'll help you gain observations. Okay? So what are some words that are repeated
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:53.060]   here? Just yell it out if you, if you notice, and it doesn't have to be the exact same words. Similar
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:06.960]   words. Okay? Christ, definitely. Can you point it out to us? It doesn't just have to be you. Obviously
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:22.320]   Christ is repeated. Tell us where you see it. Okay? Verse two. Where is that? Here? Keep yelling it out.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:47.120]   Five, six, and then eight. Okay? Hm? Okay. Good. Him. Keep going. Six says him. Where else? I thought
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:08:14.520]   I did it. Okay. What are you looking at? Okay. Christ himself. In whom? Okay. Good. Anything
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:33.720]   else? In? Okay. So in transition. Okay. Oh, is that what you mean? Okay. Okay. Alright. Very good.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:40.160]   So clearly, right, just, just looking at the highlights alone, you can say, I mean, this is,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.480]   this is like, what about Christ is something else. But obviously he's talking about Christ, right? I
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.440]   mean, the whole Bible is talking about Christ, but it's concentrated here. Okay. What, what else?
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:09:04.240]   Okay. Knowledge. Okay. Can you yell out where it is? No. Okay. Wait. Is there something else? I
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:21.320]   only have one highlight. All right. No, there's no yellow. There's no purple. What? Wait, like
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:47.520]   that? Oh. Yeah, you guys treat me like grandpa. Okay. Okay. Where else? Okay. Where's that? Okay.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:10:09.960]   Okay. Okay. Anywhere else? Okay. Good. Understanding. Okay. So you can see that,
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.880]   that's kind of concentrated here in the beginning. Okay. So all of these things will help us. Is
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:28.680]   there anything else? Oh. Okay. Okay. That's, that's good insight where Paul says repeatedly,
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:37.720]   "I." Right? So what does that tell us when you see repeatedly he's saying, "I"? Something about
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:47.040]   his ministry, about his, his goal, his desire. Okay. Good. What else? Okay. Treasures of wealth.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:11:06.800]   Okay. Can you tell me where they are? Okay. Did I miss something? Is that it? Or did I miss
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:23.640]   something? Can you see? Okay. Anything else? Okay. All right. Good. I was waiting for that to
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:42.240]   come out. All right. So. Okay. Very good. In fact, we'll see the word good discipline also fits
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:48.840]   into that. Right? Even built up. So all of these are similar ideas of being stable. Right?
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:12:01.320]   Being rooted. Okay. Okay. The opposite of that deception, delusion, being captive. Right? Okay.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.920]   So just from the repeated words, you can already see the thought flow. Right? And so where is this
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:25.360]   division? Versus two, like one, two, and three. Right? How would you title this? Maybe Paul's
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:52.080]   goal in ministry. And then five and six, instructions for the church.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:13:01.760]   Okay. So broadly speaking, that's how it's kind of broken down. Right? All right. So let's go
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:10.240]   back and look at verse one. He starts by saying, for I want you to know. And again, these are
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:18.680]   things that, like I said, if possible, do not look at commentaries. Right? Even if there might be
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   great insight in the commentary, our goal in this Bible study is not for you to learn how to use the
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.400]   commentaries. Because if you are in the habit of going to comment to every question you have,
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.080]   before digging, before doing the homework, you're going to just jump and say, oh, I wonder what my
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.760]   study Bible says. Or I wonder what he says. And then whatever he says becomes your theology. And
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.120]   then if you were asked to defend it, you can't defend it. Right? I've talked to so many people
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:50.520]   who say, I'm a cessationist, I'm a Calvinist. It's like, why? And then they'll quote somebody. It's
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.440]   like, I didn't ask you, like, they're not the final authority. Like, I didn't ask you what John
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.000]   McCarthy thinks. I didn't ask you what some study Bible says. Like, how did you come to that
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.960]   conclusion? So a lot of people can't defend the doctrines that they're so strong on. How can you
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.640]   be so strong on a doctrine that you can't defend? Other than dropping names or some books that you
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.400]   read. Right? You have to be able to defend it. So if you don't get in the habit of studying the Word
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:22.600]   of God, your doctrines will always be dependent upon who influenced you the most. So if you're
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.480]   in college and you happen to be a part of a Bible study that has certain doctrines, everything they
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.160]   believe, you're regurgitated. They're not your convictions. They're convictions of people that
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.720]   you respected. Right? Until they become your convictions, you're not going to be able to
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.520]   defend it. So when somebody else comes along that you respect, that starts to contradict the
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.680]   doctrines that you profess, you're going to get confused. You don't know what to believe. And then
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   you become open to all kinds of attack. Right? And so again, you have to get in the habit of looking
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.360]   at the scripture and finding where you found your convictions. And you can't do that unless you're
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.320]   in the Word of God yourself. So the word for "no" here, again, this is not something that you would
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.400]   know unless you know the background. This is one of those things that are very, very key in
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:13.520]   interpretation. Because there are different words for "no." Right? And I've mentioned it so many times
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.760]   in sermons and Bible study. There is a two basic understandings, "Oida" and what's the other word?
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:27.000]   "Gnosko." Right? "Oida" is just learning from perception, studying. Right? The word here is "Oida."
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:38.760]   When he says here, "knowledge of God," guess what that is? "Gnosko." Right? So his goal in for you to
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:48.520]   "Oida" is what? So that you may have "Gnosko." Okay? So just by knowing the two different words, even
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:54.360]   though in English is the same word, you know that everything he's saying here, like I want you to
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.240]   perceive and understand how much I labor for you, how much I suffered so that you may be united in
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.680]   mind. And he says all of this for what purpose? Where does he take us to? So that you may have a
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:12.040]   true knowledge of God's mystery, that you may personally know. Right? So he's not, again, as we said
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:19.080]   over and over again, our goal of the study, whether it's Hebrews, Revelation, or Leviticus, or
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:27.400]   Colossians, is not simply so you can say, "I, Oida." Right? That I know what it says. I can tell you and
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:33.560]   give you the answer. The goal of every "Oida" in Bible study is to get you to "Gnosko."
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.680]   Have a personal knowledge of God. Right? So again, this is not something that you would know just in
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.600]   English, but again, as you continue to do interpretation, that's one of the first questions
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.000]   that you will ask. Is this "Oida" or is this "Gnosko?" Because that will make a big difference in how you
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.920]   understand this text. Okay? So he starts by saying, "How great a struggle I have for you,
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.240]   behalf of you and Laodicea." Only one question came in today, and that is, "Why does he mention
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:07.080]   Laodicea with Colossians?" It's because Colossae is right under Laodicea. Colossae could have easily
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:14.280]   been one of the seven letters of the Asia Minor churches in Book of Revelation, because it literally
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:21.880]   is right underneath. The very next city is Colossae. If you remember, remember Asia Minor, that whole
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   area, Church of Smyrna, Philadelphia, Laodicea, like all those churches right there, they're all in Asia
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.360]   Minor. If you remember, Asia Minor was a place where the Holy Spirit tells Paul not to go.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:39.480]   And then he has a vision, and he ends up going into Macedonia because of a vision to come over.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.080]   During that period, there was heavy persecution that was going on in Asia Minor. Right? So if you
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.920]   remember, there's very significant things that are happening in this place, because one, persecution
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.120]   is happening where the Holy Spirit tells him to avoid it for a period. Right? Later on, Church of
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:02.200]   Ephesus is also in that area, where Paul spends the most number of time, or amount of time, in
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:09.320]   planting a church. And so Paul had a deep personal connection to this area. The whole Book of Galatians,
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:15.400]   right, is also written. And then he writes Galatians because there was a very urgent matter of the
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.920]   Judaizers having a deep impact. So the false teachers were having a huge impact in this area.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:26.600]   So if you look at a lot of Paul's attention, much of it goes to that area. And even the seven
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.440]   churches are located right in that area. You understand what I'm saying? Okay. So those churches
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.720]   in Asia Minor, there's a concentration of activity that's taking place right in that area. Right?
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.000]   So Paul is writing this church to Colossae, but his concern is not just Colossae, because
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.200]   the influence is way, way beyond Colossae. The other churches are being affected by what he's
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.800]   concerned about here. Okay? One of the first questions I asked in this is, "How great a
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.160]   struggle I have for..." Why was it important that the Colossians and the others knew that Paul was
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:07.240]   struggling from that? This is just a, you know, just a thought that I had. Like, why do you think
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.320]   Paul starts out by saying, "I want you to know how much I'm struggling for you." Is it just
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.520]   because he's trying to introduce themselves? It's like, "Yay, you know, like this is what I'm doing
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.000]   for you. You better appreciate me when I get there." Right? "Get some good food ready, because
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.840]   you don't know how much I struggle for you." Why is it important that they understand how much he's
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   struggling for them? Okay, to encourage them that they're important. Right? Again, you have to
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:47.320]   understand that Apostle Paul wasn't an ordinary missionary. He was the apostle appointed for the
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:54.200]   Gentiles. Right? So when the Apostle Paul is writing this letter, he's not just your uncle or
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:01.000]   some guy that they respect. This is the appointed apostle to them. Right? So for him to say, "You
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.400]   don't know how much I'm struggling for you." I mean, that's like almost saying, "God is bringing
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:12.440]   you to my attention. You're important to God." Right? In Apostle Paul, specific revelation is
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.080]   coming through Apostle Paul, where he's getting the mystery that was hidden for a period, and he's
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.600]   revealing it to them. So the fact that Paul is struggling to get to them, again, it's a reminder
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:29.560]   to them. He's not talking about how much I love you. Right? Of course, that is written in here,
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:37.320]   but it's a reminder to them so that they may be what? Encouraged. Right? The Apostle Paul knows
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.120]   you. Right? And he's praying for you, and he's struggling and risking his life to get this
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   message to you. So be encouraged. God has not forgotten you. He's not simply speaking on his
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:56.760]   behalf. He's speaking on behalf of Christ. Right? When he says, "I'm personally see me in front of
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.960]   that their hearts may be encouraged." What do you think was the source of their encouragement?
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:09.000]   This is where we get into trouble, because we want to encourage people. Like Apostle Paul says,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.800]   his goal is to encourage them. So we want to encourage you. Right? So if encouragement is
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:23.960]   the goal, how do I encourage you? God loves you just the way you are. There's nothing you can do
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.160]   for God to love you any more than the way he loves you now. There's nothing you can do where God's
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.120]   going to be disappointed in you. You're salvaged, you're secure. Right? Now, none of this is wrong,
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:39.960]   but we have to understand when he says, "I'm coming, I'm suffering,
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.880]   so that you may be encouraged." What was the content of his encouragement?
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:53.080]   Right? Well, he spells it out. Right? That you may have the attaining to the all the wealth
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.480]   that comes from the full assurance of understanding. In other words, all of it.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.560]   He's not just talking about the things that you like. He's talking about your encouragement comes
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:11.400]   from the whole truth. Right? And nothing but the truth. So the encouragement isn't just,
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.640]   "God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life," but the whole encouragement is the gospel
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:21.480]   itself. All of it. That you may come to a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is Christ himself,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:27.080]   in whom are hidden the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Right? So we have to be careful that
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.800]   we don't make encouragement our goal. Encouragement is the byproduct of truth.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:39.160]   Okay? Encouragement is not the end goal. It's just something that we get when we pursue the truth.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:47.480]   Right? And if you also notice, he said, "The encouraged having been knit together in love
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.360]   and attaining to all the wealth that comes from him, the full assurance of understanding." So
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:59.880]   all of these things are things that we pursue together. So truth and practice of love and being
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:06.600]   encouraged, they're all tied together. Right? You don't have pursuit of truth and unity as two
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.200]   separate things. You can't have one without the other. You can't have a heart that's filled with
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.480]   bitterness and disunited and says, "But when it comes to truth, I'm right." Because your ability
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:27.320]   to understand the truth is directly linked to the condition of your heart. Right? Even justification,
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.920]   it says, "They suppress the truth because they prefer the darkness rather than the light."
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.000]   So they reject the truth. Do you think that doesn't happen as Christians?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.360]   If you reject the truth in one arena of your life, do you think that doesn't affect your ability
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.960]   to understand the heart of God? What is intended? Yeah, of course it does. Right?
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.120]   So that's why when the scripture says, "Before you bring a gift to the altar, if you know that
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.960]   somebody has something against you, go and deal with that first." Right? "Forgive my debts as I
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:06.760]   have forgiven my debtors." Right? And so that's why every time we have communion, he says to
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.080]   examine. "He who eats and drinks without acknowledging the body of Christ eats and
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.640]   drinks judgment upon himself." So every time we have communion, it forces us to examine.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:24.200]   Is my relationship with God separate from my relationship with one another? They're together.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.240]   Right? You can't be right with God if you're wrong with your brothers and sisters.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:36.360]   If you're not walking right with God, your ability to discern the truth is affected. Right?
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:43.320]   It is. So if you haven't been praying, if you haven't been living a holy life and life with
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.600]   integrity, whether it's with your time and with your money, and then you somehow separate that
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:54.920]   from being able to discern the truth, they go hand in hand. Because we discern the truth by our
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.880]   mind, we also discern the truth by our spirit. So if your spirit is not right, it also affects
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.480]   your ability to understand. So he says, "Encourage, knit together, that we may attain the wealth that
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.320]   comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in the knowledge of the mystery,
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:17.160]   which is Christ himself." Right? Ultimately, it's not simply about the gospel. The gospel is Jesus.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:24.040]   Right? Again, I mentioned that the celebration of the gospel is not celebrating the open door,
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:30.680]   but what the open door leads to. Right? The gospel isn't access to God. It's God himself.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:37.080]   Access is just a road. Right? To celebrate that we have access to God and not actually taking
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:44.280]   the access, you miss the whole point of salvation. The goal is Christ. Okay? He says all of this
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.920]   because I say this so that no one will delete you in persuasive arguments. And then he says it again
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.160]   later on in verse 8, "See to it that no one takes you captive." And so you could already tell,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:26:00.360]   right, that this is on his mind. There's something urgent going on in Colossae and Laodicea and
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.440]   Galatians and Ephesus. False teaching has penetrated into the church and he's trying to combat that.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:12.280]   Right? And that's the reason why he's telling them to commit to the truth, to commit to one another.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:18.760]   Right? Because as soon as your heart is filled with division, there's a crack where Satan can
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   attack even in the way that you think, even the way that you perceive things,
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:31.480]   can be perverted by allowing that to permeate in your heart. Right? So we'll get back to verse 4,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:38.520]   "For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:44.360]   good discipline," and simply some of your translations will say "orderly." Right? And
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:50.120]   that's why I said this good discipline, stability, they all are similar words. So Paul's concern here,
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:57.080]   verses 5 and 6, is instructions for the church for nothing fancy. It's not taking over the world and
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.680]   making sure the gospel goes and risking your life for Christ. Paul's concern for them is to remain
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.800]   stable because they're being attacked. Right? So there are periods in our life where we need to
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:17.080]   bear arms, basically spiritually, and be ready to run into darkness. But the stage that they're in
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:23.960]   now is they're being provoked. Right? And just like the book of Hebrews, they're kind of
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.920]   starting to drift maybe because of persuasive arguments. Right? So he's saying to be orderly,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:37.240]   to stay stable in your faith. "Therefore, as you have received Christ, so walk in him." Right?
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.160]   It's not enough to just say you receive Christ. Like are you applying it in your life? What is,
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.640]   what does your faith look like in your life outside of Wednesday Bible study and Sunday
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:54.760]   worship? Right? "Walk in him, having been firmly rooted, being built up in him,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:00.840]   establishing your faith." Right? And so much of our Christian faith is about this.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:11.720]   So much of our Christian faith is learning to be strong. Right? Being rooted in Christ is not
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   something that happens in one time. It's something that happens because of godly habit. You know,
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.480]   I want to say something. I know that ever since Pastor Peter Chung came to our church, there's
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:27.720]   this revival of Bible memory. Right? And I knew that was going to happen because he was, he had
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.360]   influence. You know, we were like Bible memory was like a thing in our church, mainly because of
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:38.200]   Pastor Peter Chung. Now we always, I always say, you know, I'm amazed by his memory because he's,
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:45.080]   he's, he's like, he amazes me. Right? About how much he remembers. And so if he ever says,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.680]   "Hey, in 2014 this happened." Even if I don't remember, it's like, it probably happened.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:57.240]   Right? Because he's good. He's good at that. But as great as his memory is,
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:03.080]   the reason why he's so, so good at memorizing, and I don't mean to embarrass him, is because he
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:09.320]   devotes himself to that. He doesn't just read it and as he gets it, it's not like that. He,
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.880]   every day, two, three hours a day, he's in front of, he's in front of his, his cards, he's
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:20.120]   memorizing. So he's utilizing the gift that he has, he's maximizing it. And that's why he's so
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:25.320]   good at it. Right? It's not simply because, yes, God has given him a gift of good memory. But he
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.760]   wouldn't, he would, he would remember a lot of random things for no, no good purpose. Like what
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:37.560]   kind of tie I wore 15 years ago. I mean, useless information. Right? But the reason why he's good
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:43.000]   at it is because he, he really is devoted. And that's challenging to all of us. Right? So,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.320]   so much of our walk with God isn't something like, "Oh, I go to retreats or heard a great sermon, or
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:54.920]   I joined a good Bible study." So much of our walk with God and our health in our, in our walk with
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:02.360]   God is your daily routines. Or what you do on a day to day basis have far more effect in your walk
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:09.880]   with God than what retreat you went to and what speaker you heard, what book you read, you know,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:16.200]   what small group or who, who's mentoring you. All of these things are helpful, but nothing will
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:23.080]   impact you as much of a, as much as a daily discipline that you value and you do on a daily
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.600]   basis. Right? So Paul talking about all of this, all of these things, he says, talking about being
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.160]   stable, being rooted, being built up, being established. Right? And that's what we're trying
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   to work on in our Bible studies, right? In our daily routines. See to it that no one takes you
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:47.960]   captive. Right? Captive basically means to be carried off. Right? In fact, some of your
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:54.440]   translations, it may actually even say, take, take you hostage involuntarily. And he says,
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.200]   it's because he's using, just like he says in verse four, persuasive arguments.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.960]   With these arguments, if they weren't persuasive, it wouldn't be tempting. No one would be deceived.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:13.000]   It's because it's coming through very articulate men who seem to be representing God, who seem to
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.720]   know the scripture, but they're twisting it. Right? So he says, the reason why they're in danger is
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:25.960]   because these arguments are persuasive. They're persuasive because they're philosophical. You know,
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:31.080]   they have the ability to deceive. It's in accord with tradition of men. In other words, this is
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:37.640]   around us all the time, according to elementary principles of the world. So the basic principles
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:43.240]   that surround us and tempt us every single day. So these false teachings are tapping into that.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:49.880]   Why is the health and wealth gospel so popular? Because it's tapping into the worldly principle.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:56.520]   Right? That if you work hard, you're going to make money. If you go to get the right job,
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.400]   and if you connect with the right people, and the health and wealth gospel basically is tapping into
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.800]   those worldly principles and saying, well, all these things may not work. If you tap into God,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:11.960]   you can get that. Right? So nothing has changed. Only your means to get the world has changed.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:18.040]   And that's why it's so popular because they haven't abandoned anything. They've never picked
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.920]   up their cross. They've never denied themselves. They're still pursuing the world. They're just
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:27.480]   doing it in the name of Jesus. And that's why it's popular. And that's why it says it's persuasive
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.800]   arguments in accord with traditions of men, in elementary principles of the world. And it's very
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:40.440]   deceptive because you don't know you're being deceived. Because you're doing it in the name
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.280]   of Christ. And because you're in the church, because you're reading the Bible, and you're
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:50.600]   actually praying that you automatically think you're safe. But the only thing that has changed
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.800]   is the means to get what you want. You're still pursuing your own life. You're still pursuing
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.960]   your flesh. You're still pursuing your own glory. It's just you're hoping that God will give it to
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:09.080]   you instead of you working hard for it. Right? And that's why that theology is so pervasive. And why
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:14.600]   it carries us away. That's why you can be in the church all your life. You call me Lord, Lord, but
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:20.760]   say your heart is far from me. Why did they call him Lord, Lord? It wasn't for me. It wasn't because
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:26.760]   you were you were wanting me to be your Lord. It's Lord, Lord, give me something. Right? Everything
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.280]   that they did, they did it for themselves. They didn't do it for God. That's what Jesus meant.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:36.200]   Right? So he said that that's why it's so pervasive. That's why we need to watch out.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.160]   Right? But in the end, ultimately, his goal is to get us to Christ. Because what's going to
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:47.640]   deliver us from these things that are so powerful in our lives? Right? Because all the wealth and
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:54.040]   wisdom and understanding is where? In Christ. That's how we keep saying over and over again
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:34:03.160]   to fix your eyes on Christ. Right? Because then you begin to distinguish. Right? When you fix your
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.840]   eyes upon Christ, like along with that, the fruit of that, you'll be able to distinguish what is not
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:14.200]   Christ. But when your eyes are not fixed on Christ, sometimes you're very confused. Because
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:19.400]   sometimes it comes from the pulpit. Sometimes it comes from books and conferences and other
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.360]   Christians that you respect. And you don't discern. Because when your eyes are not fixated
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:30.680]   on Christ, you're not able to discern the difference. Okay? So in the end, that's his
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:37.640]   main goal. To get us to be fixated on that and not to be carried away. Okay? All right.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:44.840]   The next week's passage is in Colossians chapter 2, 9 through 15. And discussion questions are on
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.640]   the bottom. Okay? Let me pray for us and then I'll have you guys get into your small groups.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:55.960]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing over this time. We pray for our small group leaders
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.840]   that you give them wisdom in how to lead. And I pray that in our discussions that we may be
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:06.040]   open and honest. That we truly may be a community that is united together as one.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:12.200]   Help us, Lord God, to know what it means to be encouraged and to be united to pursue you.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:20.520]   That we may gain Christ and to know the riches, Lord God, that is found in him and him alone.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.920]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
