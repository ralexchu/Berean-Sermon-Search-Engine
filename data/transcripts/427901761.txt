[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   If you can turn to Hebrews, and I know some of you guys who are on the Facebook, you saw
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.480]   me changing the name of the title of the sermon this morning, "No Justice, No Peace."
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.260]   And I know some of you probably saw that change and thought, "Finally, he's addressing what's
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.260]   going on."
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.540]   Okay, and some of you guys may have said that, and maybe some of you look at this symbol
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.720]   of this fist, and that symbol alone kind of triggers bad thoughts.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.920]   And so, what is going on?
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.920]   Well, all over the country, maybe even all over the world, right now people are protesting
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.360]   and saying, "No justice, no peace."
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.460]   And that little phrase is something that's been around for many decades.
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.840]   And I actually did a study to find out where it started, and no one knows for sure.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.820]   Some people think that it started maybe during the Civil Rights Movement in the '60s.
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.180]   Some people think that it may have started sometime in the '70s after the Vietnam War
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.600]   during the protest at "No Justice, No Peace."
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.960]   We don't know exactly where it started, but what we do know is that the idea behind "No
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.400]   Justice, No Peace" is rooted in Scripture.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.920]   In fact, the very foundations upon the gospel in which we celebrate and sing about is at
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.440]   the core, "No Justice, No Peace."
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.680]   In fact, all throughout the Old Testament, God is establishing the necessity of justice.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.720]   And as the Jews were looking for the shalom, for peace, and they would greet each other
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.120]   for peace, God was establishing that the only way that peace was going to come about is
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.000]   if God brings back justice, righteousness.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.040]   So at the core of the gospel message is this message, "There is no justice, there is no
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.600]   peace."
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.040]   But here's our dilemma.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.840]   Who's justice?
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.680]   And what kind of peace are we looking for?
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.320]   If we look from the black communities, and again, obviously black community are not the
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.480]   only people who experience racism.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.140]   You don't have to be a particular race to know what racism is.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.360]   You can be a Caucasian in America and experience racism.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.260]   But the black community in particular, and I think it's important for us to acknowledge
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.140]   their pain.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.380]   No other group of people, yes, there are Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, there are Native
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.880]   Americans, and various other groups of people who have experienced tremendous racism.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.800]   But to African Americans, their history is slavery.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.400]   They were brought here by force hundreds of years ago with forced labor.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:02.280]   And so even though that was many, many generations ago, racism was blatant even up to the 1960s.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.480]   And so you have a community of people where there is deep-rooted bitterness and even hatred
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.740]   that is underlying what they remember, what their history is.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:22.780]   So to simply say to get over it is not only too simplistic, but is highly insensitive.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.580]   They are more sensitive to what seems to be racism.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.880]   Even if objectively we may look at it and say, "How is that racism?"
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.320]   They are more sensitive to racism, understandably.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.240]   Just like if somebody was abused, they are more sensitive to abuse.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.440]   If somebody has grown up in an abusive home, and what may seem like abuse, they are going
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.280]   to, whenever that gets triggered, their emotions get triggered, all of their past experiences,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.360]   all their grandparents, and all their past history are all going to come into play in
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.120]   how they view that particular situation.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.400]   In fact, I remember, you know, like I told you, you know, like I have personal experience
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.760]   in racism, but I had a friend back in junior high school, and we went to school in the
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.480]   valley.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.080]   He was so sensitive to racism because he didn't, I came to the United States when I was really
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.800]   young, so my, you know, English was fine, but he came a little bit later.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.320]   He came almost at the end of elementary school, so he had a thick accent.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.600]   And so, you know, obviously people targeted him, "You dumb chink, dumb chink," but he
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.000]   was not a small guy like me, he was a big guy.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.900]   And so he was so hypersensitive.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.960]   I remember walking down the hall one time, and we heard something at the end of the hall,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.680]   and he went running, and then he started railing on some kid, and I had to pull him off, and
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.200]   we were walking out of school, and I said, "What happened?"
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.000]   He said, he said something about ching chong something, and he heard it at the end of the
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.920]   hallway, and I don't even know if that's what actually happened.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.400]   He may have dropped something, he may have made it sound like ching chong or something,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.780]   but he was so sensitive.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.920]   Something that sounded like racism, he ran over there, because he was like constantly
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.200]   walking in rage.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.280]   So to a certain extent, it's understandable that there is hypersensitivity, and I think
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.640]   it is insensitive and not right for us to not to acknowledge that, that there is that.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.800]   And the anger toward the politicians in particular, and to the police, because they represent
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.240]   the power structure, and that's where they've experienced racism.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.220]   Even if it's not personal, at least historically.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.340]   So for us to completely nullify that, again, it's beyond insensitive, and I think that's
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.660]   something that Christians should be sensitive about and pay attention to.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.100]   But we also need to acknowledge from the other point of view.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.820]   Our police officers, right now there's a movement to defund the police, the police are evil.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:07.360]   Even if you're a police officer, and you have taken an oath to serve and to protect, and
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.260]   your job is to go out there and risk your health and your life to help other people,
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.640]   and because of a few acts of certain police officers, a small percentage of them, have
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:27.240]   abused their power, that the hatred going toward the police also seems very racist.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:34.040]   A broad stroke toward every officer that has been trying to do their job.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.240]   In fact, think about this perspective.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:45.360]   Not that many years ago, after 9/11, the two planes hit the Twin Towers, while thousands
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.860]   of people were running away from that building because of danger, police officers and firemen
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.100]   ran toward those buildings, and hundreds of them, in the context of trying to save these
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.820]   lives, lost their lives when those buildings crumbled.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.960]   Some of you guys may not remember, you might have been too young, but for several years
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:17.500]   after that, people would buy NYPD and NYF, right, fire department, uniforms and hats
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.540]   to celebrate the bravery of our police officers, first responders.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.260]   They were the heroes of our society not that many years ago, because they literally, their
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:33.260]   job is a calling to risk their lives, give their lives for the safety of other people.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.340]   So to be in that situation, and then just a few years later, to be demonized, saying
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.060]   that they are all racist, you can understand why it is very difficult for them to handle.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:50.100]   And you have the police officers and the people who are deeply hurt by the history of this
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.940]   country standing side by side, pushing each other, and why there is animosity in these
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.660]   demonstrations, is understandable.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:06.680]   Even the protesting of the flag, you can see how the black community are taking the knee
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.660]   to protest what they view as injustice.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:18.060]   And you can see the response from that, in particular from veterans who went out to war,
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.820]   and for them, it's not just a symbol.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.780]   They lost their friends, people that they loved, that they walked with, that they are
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.020]   going to remember for the rest of their lives.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.180]   So to them, disrespecting the flag is disrespecting their friend.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:39.180]   So you can imagine why there is an extreme response from kneeling from that community.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.700]   And we can also understand the heart behind why they are maybe protesting.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:51.220]   Again, whether you agree or don't agree, we can understand the heart behind that.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:57.700]   That slogan, "No justice, no peace," it is rooted in the Bible.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.380]   But how do you practice this?
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.220]   Whose justice?
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:09.380]   Because what is justice to one community may be injustice to another community.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:15.940]   What may seem like justice to one group can easily be interpreted as injustice in another
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.940]   group.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.140]   So is justice in community simply based upon who has the power?
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.580]   So if the police and the government has power, they can do whatever they want and whatever
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.380]   they think is justice and treat people any way they want because they have the power
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.380]   and whatever they view as justice.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.340]   If we have enough rioting and enough force and get enough people to get behind these
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.140]   protests and they can strong-arm people and even get rid of the police station, is that
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.620]   justice?
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:48.000]   Whoever has power, how do we practice this?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.180]   If it is at the root of the gospel that you and I profess and sing and believe in, how
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.980]   do we practice something that is so difficult to practice?
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.620]   You know, I didn't change my sermon today.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.780]   It just happened that the topic of the sermon, the text that we're looking at today, tells
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.580]   us that Jesus Christ is the King of righteousness and King of peace.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.580]   You know, what's interesting is the word for righteousness, dikaios, in other parts of
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.420]   the Bible is translated justice.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.380]   It is the same word.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.940]   So in other words, this text tells us that Jesus is the King of justice and Jesus is
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.100]   the King of peace.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.420]   So again, I didn't jump into this text.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.540]   It just happened in God's sovereignty we landed on this text.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.700]   Hebrews chapter 7, 2B, this is what it says.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:42.860]   By the translation of His name, King of righteousness, Melchizedek, Melchi means the King, Zedek,
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.500]   righteousness or justice.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.380]   His name means King of justice and then also King of Salem.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.380]   Salem is the Hebrew version of that is Shalom.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.460]   Many people think that Salem is the old ancient name of Jerusalem, Jerusalem meaning city,
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.900]   Shalom meaning peace.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.580]   So He's the King of righteousness and the King of peace.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:10.460]   But if you notice here, the author, if you don't pay attention, there's a subtle but
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.940]   very important thing that he says here.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:19.780]   By the translation of His name, King of righteousness and then also King of Salem, King of peace.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.780]   He puts that in order.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.380]   In other words, that's no different than saying no justice, no peace because peace
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.920]   comes from righteousness.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.420]   Righteousness first and then peace.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:36.180]   If we don't establish righteousness, there can be no peace because peace without righteousness
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.460]   is anarchy.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.540]   Righteousness without peace is fascism.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.620]   Whoever has the power does whatever they want.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:51.860]   The whole purpose of why we study the Bible, what the gospel is, why Jesus came and died
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:58.300]   and was resurrected and established His new kingdom is so that by establishing righteousness,
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.900]   by establishing justice, that He was going to bring peace.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.360]   In Psalm 85, 9 through 10, it says, "Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.960]   that glory may dwell in our land, loving kindness and truth met together, righteousness and
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.580]   peace have kissed each other."
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.900]   In description of the kingdom that Christ was going to bring, He says that righteousness
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.620]   and peace are going to have perfect harmony.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.060]   They're going to kiss each other.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:34.860]   See, at the root of who Jesus is, King of justice, King of righteousness.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:44.660]   See, it is very, very difficult for us to practice justice because for four reasons.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.380]   One, the way we see justice, we see it from our point of view.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.840]   And there's no human being that is not biased that way.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.920]   Every single person is biased that way.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:03.560]   The longer that I live, the more I become biased because of my past experience.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.920]   Certain things that I've experienced, certain things that I've read, it causes me to be
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.840]   biased because when I run into somebody or I get into a certain situation, I remember
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.960]   the previous situation.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.120]   I remember the previous experience.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.480]   And so I don't start neutral.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.520]   I start with wherever I left off.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   And every single human being is biased to a certain degree.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.440]   You know, when you're a child, if you've raised children or every single one of us were children
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.600]   at one point, and I think you all know what I'm talking about.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.880]   You hear the term, it's not fair.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   What is fair?
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.280]   Usually, what we consider fair really starts with us.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:45.780]   I remember when our kids were young, you know, in order to take them to Disneyland, and again,
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.080]   you guys know how much I love being at Disneyland.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.840]   We did it for the kids.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.340]   Spent all day sacrificing, literally carrying our cross for the kids.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.720]   And at the end of the day, we're going home thinking, oh, let's get some Jamba juice,
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.120]   you know, and we stop over, get some Jamba juice.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.580]   But then they didn't get quite the flavor that they wanted, or we had to split the cup
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.800]   in half, and the other kid got a little bit more than the other.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.360]   And the rest of the ride from Jamba juice home was, it's not fair.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.960]   Now, as a parent, I want to pull over and get everybody to leave and walk home, okay?
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.480]   I've literally, you know, spent all day in the hot sun, paying money I didn't want to
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.200]   pay, in a place I didn't want to be.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.360]   Mickey Mouse in my face all day long.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.240]   And because you didn't get what you wanted, it's not fair.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.380]   Now, we're not kids.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.080]   We're a lot more sophisticated than that.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.440]   But we say that in our hearts all the time.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.040]   When we don't get what we want, God doesn't answer our prayers, or when people say certain
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.080]   things, we say in our hearts, it's not fair.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.440]   I've heard a lot of people say, "I didn't get a stimulus check."
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.360]   Maybe, what happened?
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.720]   What did you do to earn that stimulus check?
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.800]   But I've heard a lot of people say, "It's not fair."
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.600]   You know, Jesus has a parable about that in the Bible, in Matthew chapter 20, 1 through
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.840]   16, the parable of the laborers, where he promised a certain amount of money, but certain
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.400]   people went in at different parts of the day, and then a guy got it at the very last hour,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.740]   and he got paid the same thing.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.560]   And the rest of the workers who worked all day say, "What?
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.940]   It's not fair."
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.820]   It wasn't because God was unjust.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.240]   Because God promised them, and they're getting what they were promised, but the other people
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.480]   got better.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:43.360]   See, our idea of justice usually starts with us.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.960]   How does it benefit us?
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.440]   And so because it starts with us, it's always from our perspective, it's very difficult
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.720]   for us to really come down with what we think is just.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.640]   Because what we think is just is unjust from another person's perspective.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.280]   So how do we do that?
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.820]   In Judges chapter 21, verse 25, during the period of Judges, if you've read that text,
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.520]   he said that the reason why they kept on falling into sin cycle over and over again, he says,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.040]   "In those days, there were no king in Israel, and everyone did what was right in his own
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   eyes."
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.240]   Notice here, they didn't say everyone did what was wrong in their own eyes, everyone
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.620]   did what they thought was right in their own eyes.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.920]   What they thought was righteous, what they thought was just.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.400]   And that's what kept on causing this problem, this cycle, because there was no king.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.520]   Well the Bible tells us that Christ comes in the order of Melchizedek, and there's only
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.380]   one king of righteousness.
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:51.520]   And until he is established as king, we have a tendency, all of us, to do what is right
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.080]   in our own eyes.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:59.280]   And what we think is right in our own eyes would be unrighteous in someone else's eyes,
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.600]   and eventually you're going to meet each other.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.220]   In your pursuit of justice from your perspective, you're going to meet somebody else in pursuit
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.720]   of justice in their perspective, and you're going to clash, and the result is going to
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:17.120]   be whoever has the biggest gun is going to win.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.480]   And that's where war comes from.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:26.000]   Two countries seeking justice in their own eyes, and whoever has the biggest guns ends
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.360]   up determining what is just.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.960]   The second reason why it is difficult for us, and only Christ can be the king of righteousness,
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:40.080]   king of justice, our idea of justice keeps changing.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.640]   What was just 30 years ago is no longer just today.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.000]   What was just 100 years ago is no longer just today.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.600]   I remember right after 9/11, the whole country was outraged, Republicans and Democrats.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   And for the first time, I saw the Republicans and Democrats standing side by side with their
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.540]   arms linked saying, "We're going to go to war.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:10.240]   We cannot let them attack our family and children in our land."
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:16.040]   And so they all universally, not just President Bush, the Democrats, Republicans said, "We
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.640]   are united.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640]   We are not divided."
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.840]   They went to war.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.760]   Since then, years have passed, and many anti-war movements have come in, and now these same
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.800]   politicians who at that time, in order to get elected and stay elected, voted for the
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.400]   war, now they're backtracking saying that was a mistake, because what was right then
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.200]   is no longer right today.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   Even in the church, if we're not careful, if our righteousness is not grounded in Christ
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.400]   and His word, what was acceptable 30 years ago is no longer acceptable today.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.720]   What wasn't acceptable 30 years ago is no longer acceptable today.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.440]   Our tendency is that we continue to change.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   There is no such thing as relative truth.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.360]   In order for justice to be true justice, it has to be justice in every generation.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.760]   It can't be just to you and then unjust to that person, because in the context of practicing
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:22.300]   justice, you're going to practice injustice with somebody else.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.720]   You have, truth has to be immovable.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.600]   Truth cannot be flexible.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.400]   You cannot know anything unless you have truth.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:40.960]   The Bible uses the term cubit to describe a size of something, 10 cubit, 15 cubit.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.080]   If you've never heard that term or somebody never explained to you the size of what a
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.120]   cubit is, you probably have no idea.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.160]   A cubit could be a mile.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.800]   A cubit could be a weight.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.480]   Cubit could be half a mile.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.620]   You don't know.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.640]   The only way that we know what a cubit is, is we compare it with something that we know
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.680]   to be true, that it doesn't change.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:10.040]   A cubit usually is a measure between someone's arm and his hands, his palms.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.240]   So in the average, it's about 12 inches, about a foot.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.920]   So when the Bible says it's a cubit of something, it's about a foot of something.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.160]   20 cubits would be 20 foot, something, right?
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.740]   But we know what it is because we're able to compare with something that is consistent.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.780]   If a cubit is something to you and it's something to you and it's different to him and it's
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.980]   different today and different tomorrow, you can never know what a cubit is.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.940]   You can't practice justice if what justice looks like is different today and is different
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.940]   tomorrow.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.440]   It's different to this person, but it's different to that person.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.100]   To the rich, justice looks like this.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.940]   To the poor, justice looks like this.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:55.100]   So you and I are not able to practice perfect justice because it is constantly changing
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.420]   when it is based upon ourselves.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.180]   The Isaiah 40 verse 8, it says, "The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.540]   God stands forever."
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:08.460]   There's only one thing that stands consistent, generation after generation.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.280]   The truth is the truth.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.780]   Whether you are white, black, Asian, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.780]   It is the truth.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.140]   And so he says, "The king of righteousness is Christ."
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.100]   The king of justice is Christ.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:28.420]   And if Christ is not king, there is no justice because justice cannot be relative.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:34.580]   Thirdly, it's hard for us to practice justice because we lack knowledge.
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:40.100]   Right now, you have to be very, very careful how you consume information.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.780]   And it is not only true today, it is true all the time.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:48.260]   I remember one of the best things that I learned while I was in seminary or while I was taking
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.280]   Bible class, we were learning Western civilization.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.440]   And our professor gave us an assignment and he said, "All your resources has to be first-hand
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.520]   resources."
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.260]   For those of you who don't know what first-hand resources is, you have to go to the original
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.840]   person who wrote it.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.780]   And so I said, "Well, how do I even do that?"
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:10.300]   So he said, he told us where these resources are and we have to go to certain seminaries
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.820]   and we have to go to Cal State, we have to go to UC.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.380]   And if you go to the dungeon, usually people don't read this stuff because a lot of times
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.380]   it's not translated.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.420]   Or if it is translated, it's very difficult to read and it's volumes and volumes.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.140]   So it's not a condensed version.
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.220]   It's just original writing of whoever wrote it.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.100]   So we were learning about Western civilization.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.780]   So I had to go dig up books in the dungeon that they probably haven't been touched for
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.140]   decades.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.500]   And only people like us who are learning how to do research would ever even go look for
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.540]   these books.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:43.700]   And I remember doing research about certain particular period of history.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:49.700]   And the point that he was trying to make is how much of the history books are their interpretation
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.920]   of what they read.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.780]   So you can have one person write about George Washington as the godliest man on earth and
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:01.300]   you can have another person writing about George Washington and he was a reprobate.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.140]   Now which is true.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.900]   So he was teaching us how to go to the original source.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:15.100]   So all information, not just media, all information come through people who have sinful agendas
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.940]   because they are looking at things from their purpose.
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.340]   Whether they are doing it deliberately, whether they are doing it because they are blind,
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.460]   all information we have to be careful.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:34.400]   We especially now, because of how fast the information spreads, we've all seen videos
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.100]   of cops pushing people.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.260]   Oh, that's another sign of racism.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:44.380]   And then we see the larger context of somebody trying to swing a bat at him or a molotov
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.260]   cocktail and that part is not shown.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.740]   They only show you that part where he pushed and they said, "Oh my gosh, they didn't
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.020]   show the whole context."
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.020]   And you can see that in the other.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.940]   You can see a police officer arresting that person and they say, "Hey, this guy was
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.900]   resisting arrest and he was doing all this stuff."
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.840]   When you see the larger context, that wasn't the case.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.800]   He wasn't resisting the arrest.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.740]   And there was abuse.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.440]   So we have to be very careful how we consume information because we need to have perfect
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.060]   knowledge to be able to practice that.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:18.820]   But the problem is, even if we knew all the context, you and I are not omniscient.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:26.780]   Job, if you remember, what humanly speaking has experienced tremendous injustice because
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.620]   he was righteous, he was targeted.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.160]   He loses his health, his children, his wealth, even his friends come there accusing him,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.460]   all this happened because you did something wrong.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.400]   There's three cycles of this in the book of Job.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.640]   And finally, Job cracks.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.840]   He was standing strong until the end and he cracks and he says, "God, why are you allowing
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   this to happen?
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840]   I'm a righteous man.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.040]   Why did you do this to me?"
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.520]   And he begins to complain and then God shows up to speak to him in Job chapter 38, 2-5.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.600]   Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.860]   In other words, Job, you have no idea what's going on.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:10.420]   Now gird up your loins like a man and I will ask you and you instruct me since you are
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.580]   trying to say that you are being unjust.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.500]   Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.860]   Tell me if you have understanding.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.340]   Who set its measurements since you know or who stretched the line on it?
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.500]   In other words, do you know who you are?
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.940]   And do you know who you are?
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.200]   Question me.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:34.340]   In Job chapter 40, verse 1 and 2, after three chapters of God putting him in his place that
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.820]   you don't have the knowledge to be able to know what is right and what is wrong.
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.160]   And then he says, chapter 40, verse 1 and 2, "Then the Lord said to Job, 'Will the faultfinder
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.940]   contend with the Almighty?'"
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.620]   In other words, it's not fair.
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.180]   "Let him who reproves God answer it.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.300]   God not only knows all things, He knows us.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:02.100]   Not only does He know all the information in Psalm 139, 2-4, 'You know when I sit down
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.460]   and when I rise up, you understand my thought from afar.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:11.300]   You scrutinize my path and my lying down and are intimately acquainted with all my ways.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.360]   Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it all.'
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.900]   Not only does He know all information because He's the creator, He says He already knows
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.060]   what's in our heart.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.940]   If there really is racism or not, He already knows what's crooked.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.820]   He already knows our intention even before we actually even do it.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.620]   See, you and I lack knowledge.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.620]   We lack context.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.140]   Do you have that picture?
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.140]   I don't know.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.140]   I think I might have missed it.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.140]   You do?
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.140]   Okay, can you put that up?
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.140]   See that picture?
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.140]   Remember that?
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.460]   Remember this?
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.460]   What color is that?
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.300]   Some of you guys may remember because I saw it all over your Facebook.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.460]   Some people see it as blue and black.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.740]   Some people see it as white and gold, right?
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:03.020]   Okay, this picture, I don't know if this represents that properly, but this was a big
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:07.420]   thing on the internet because it's actually, I guess for most people, they see it blue
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.940]   and gold and a lot of people saw it as white.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.820]   No, blue and black, a lot of people saw it as white and gold and they were fighting each
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.820]   other.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.740]   You guys remember this?
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.180]   Am I the only one that has internet?
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.180]   Okay.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:26.300]   Yeah, so they're looking at this and they were, because absolutely adamant.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.460]   How do you know what is true?
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.000]   If enough people say it's black and blue, does it become black and blue?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.900]   What if they actually see white and gold?
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:44.820]   You and I don't have the ability to make that final judgment.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.820]   Only God knows.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.120]   Not only does God know the truth, only God knows our heart.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.680]   But fourth and most importantly, this is what you and I need to remember.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.180]   We are sinful.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.020]   So our perspective will always be sinful.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.620]   Even the way that we see justice is sinful.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:10.600]   In Romans 3, 10 through 12, it says, "There is none righteous, not even one.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.100]   There is none who understands.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.940]   There is none who seeks for God.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.940]   All have turned aside.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.620]   Together, they have become useless.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.940]   There is none who does good.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.600]   There is not even one."
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.560]   Now some people may look at that and say, "That's a hyperbole.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.280]   That can't be true.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.200]   Nobody seeks God, not even one.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.340]   Everybody has turned aside.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.280]   Together they have become useless.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.500]   Clearly, there has to be hyperbole.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.240]   This can't be true.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:49.800]   Either he is just overblowing the state of mankind or if he is actually telling the truth,
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.020]   there's not a single person who is exempt from this.
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:04.560]   And because Satan and sin has tainted not only our heart but our sight and our mind,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.500]   our ability to even reason has been tainted by sin.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:16.660]   And that is the starting point of salvation when we recognize that we have sinned and
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.420]   that that sin has tainted all that I am.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.580]   So repentance isn't just, "I repent because I did this act.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.660]   I repent because I did that."
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:32.900]   Repentance is recognizing that I don't have the ability to know what is right and wrong.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.460]   I don't just repent about an act.
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:38.220]   I repent of who I am.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.380]   It's our sin that causes us to see things in certain perspective.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:48.820]   And until we humble ourselves before the throne, when we say, "No justice, no peace," if we're
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:54.500]   not careful, you can do more damage than good.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.860]   Hurt people have a tendency to hurt other people.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.220]   True?
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.220]   Hurt people have a tendency to hurt other people.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.740]   But here's the problem.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.820]   Who's in here that hasn't been hurt?
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:17.500]   I can tell you in 30 plus years that I've been in ministry and counseling people, I
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:25.340]   haven't met a single person, not one, who doesn't have deep pain.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.820]   Whether it was somebody did something to them or something happened in their life or coming
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.700]   from their families or even just from their own sins, there's not a single person that
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:39.180]   I've ever met that isn't hurt.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:46.940]   And so our natural tendency for those who are hurt is to hurt other people.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.940]   You know, the most dangerous people are not the people who are doing wrong and they know
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.540]   it's wrong.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:58.420]   Those most dangerous people are people who think they're right.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:06.100]   They're unrighteous in carrying out what they think is justice.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:12.420]   Because they feel it's right, because we feel it's right, that even the way we do it, even
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.540]   if it's wrong, because we're on the right, it justifies it.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:26.980]   Our sinfulness causes us to make it difficult for us to carry out justice.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:32.860]   So here's what the gospel says.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.380]   Jesus Christ comes in the office of Melchizedek.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.500]   He's the king of justice.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:46.820]   And only when justice is carried out by the king, we can have true peace.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:53.340]   Remember, if you look at the Jewish community, nobody suffered more than the Jewish people,
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.980]   all the way up to modern history.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.020]   If you look at their history, they started out in slavery.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.100]   For hundreds of years, they were oppressed by the Egyptians.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.540]   And the reason why they started was because God heard their oppression and crying out,
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.620]   and he answered their prayer and he delivered them.
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.380]   And then they wandered down the desert, they had to fight and scrap just to get into the
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.540]   promised land.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:20.660]   But a few years later, the Assyrians come in and brutalizes them, forced them into labor,
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.940]   take all the precious things and all the precious people, and they take them into bondage and
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.100]   they're living in bondage.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.180]   And after that, the Babylonians come and they enslave them.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.700]   After that, the Persians come and they're a little bit more gracious, but for the most
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.180]   part they're living under dominion.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.100]   After the Persians come, it came the Greeks and Greeks dominated them.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.140]   And after the Greeks came, the Romans came and then the Romans dominated them.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.700]   And I don't have to tell you about the modern history.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:51.220]   We know about the Holocaust, but there's almost 2000 years in between of suffering.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.620]   In fact, you can take a whole class if you go to the university of just the suffering
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.900]   of the Jewish people.
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.300]   But at the time of Christ, when Jesus was telling his people, "When you get slapped
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.780]   on one cheek, turn the other cheek," do you know why Jesus said that?
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.540]   Because they were getting slapped.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.700]   Jesus said to the Jewish people, "If they tell you to walk a mile, walk a second mile."
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.740]   That wasn't a random statement.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:21.860]   There was actually a Roman law that said, even if you're a pregnant woman, if you were
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.660]   a Jew, a Roman soldier carrying all of his equipment got tired and he said, "I need
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660]   you to carry this."
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.500]   By law, they had to carry it a mile.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.700]   By law.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.420]   So you can imagine the animosity and the hatred that they had that was built up from generation
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.920]   to generation.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.460]   If any group of people that was oppressed, it was the Jewish people.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:52.260]   So you can understand why they wanted a militant Messiah.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:58.920]   They wanted the Messiah to come and finally overthrow their enemies.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.900]   Because they were living injustice.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.500]   They felt this injustice day after day.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.460]   But remember when Jesus is going into Jerusalem, he wept.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.460]   Remember why he wept?
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:19.980]   He wept because he said, "Only if you knew today what would bring true peace.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:27.940]   But because you did not recognize the King of Justice, you will not see this peace."
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.660]   And he wept.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:37.280]   And it was finally time for him to go to the cross when he was offered up with Barabbas.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.580]   They rejected him.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:44.500]   And it was not by accident that Barabbas was a zealot who was a militant Jew who wanted
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:49.060]   to overthrow their enemies with his knife.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.900]   They wanted to overthrow.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.220]   And so they wanted Jesus to join the revolution.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:35:01.620]   And when he would not and he gave up his life and he surrendered, what did they say?
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.740]   We'd rather have Barabbas.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:10.840]   We want somebody who's going to bring justice the way we want justice.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.420]   And so they crucified him.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.400]   Because he would not join the revolution.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:25.500]   Because the peace that he was going to bring did not look anything like they were expecting.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.180]   In Isaiah chapter 42, verse 1 and 4, it says, "Behold, my servant whom I uphold, my chosen
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.100]   one in whom my soul delights.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.820]   I have put my spirit upon him.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.700]   He will bring forth justice to the nations."
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:43.460]   If we stop right there, you would think that they were right to wait for the Messiah, the
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.980]   King, to overthrow.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:52.220]   Because if any group of people would have been shouting in their souls, "No justice,
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.960]   no peace."
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.980]   We want Shalom.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:03.340]   And we want a Messiah that's going to come and bring justice.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.860]   But this messianic promise doesn't end in verse 1.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.860]   It goes in verse 2.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:12.660]   It says, "He will not cry out or raise his voice."
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.060]   He's talking about how he's going to bring his justice.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:22.060]   "He will not cry out or raise his voice, nor make his voice heard in the street.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:28.340]   A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not extinguish.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.100]   He will faithfully bring forth justice."
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:42.340]   See, that part in verse 2 and 3 doesn't fit what we think justice is.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.580]   He came and he offered his life.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:53.220]   The only just human being, the only righteous being that has ever lived on this earth, the
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:59.020]   only one who had the right to say, "No justice, no peace."
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:07.620]   Any person who walked this earth who could justly say, "No justice, no peace," absorbed
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.160]   our sins.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.620]   And as it says in 1 Peter 3, 18, "For Christ also died for sins once for all, to adjust
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:23.340]   for the unjust, so that he might bring us to God, having put forth to death in the flesh,
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:28.120]   but made alive in the Spirit."
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:37.740]   The greatest injustice on earth was experienced by Christ, the only just.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.500]   The just for the unjust.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.220]   You know, people are saying, "Why don't we march?"
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.400]   I don't have any problem with marching.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.720]   If you see racism, you should call it out.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.340]   If something is wrong, we should not stay silent.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:05.020]   What I've heard people say is, "All we're going to do, preach the gospel."
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:10.980]   And I hear some people say that, even from pastors, I hear people saying that.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:18.180]   Do you not realize that that's why we preach the gospel in the first place?
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.700]   Social justice and the gospel are not two separate things.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:31.020]   We preach the gospel because the gospel is the only answer to racism.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.700]   The Jews want signs, the Greek want wisdom.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.100]   And the reason why they want signs and they want wisdom is because that's what they think
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.100]   power is.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.540]   But Paul says, "We preach Christ crucified."
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:49.660]   Foolishness to those who are perishing, but to those who are being saved, the power of
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.180]   God and the wisdom of God.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.900]   Do you believe this?
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:04.100]   Especially now, as the world is chanting, because they think they know the answer.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:11.660]   As Christians, whose eyes have been opened to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:16.620]   justice can only be found when Christ is established as King.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:23.740]   And true peace, true shalom, will only come to us by the grace, by the blood and the body
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.580]   broken for us.
