[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   So, hopefully, the study of the book of Revelations has made an impact, at least on the way that
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.240]   you think about your life, and again, so that we would not be caught off guard.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.800]   Revelation 6.15, "Behold, I am coming like a thief.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.680]   Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.040]   naked and be seen exposed."
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.860]   So, the second part of it where it says to stay awake, right?
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.360]   What does it mean to be awake as a Christian, to be sober in the way that we live?
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.400]   Again, the challenge that we have is that there's so much distraction, especially where
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.920]   we live, in a generation that we live.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.700]   How do we stay sober where we are at, right?
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.760]   Not to get the standard of our Christian living by the people that we're next to, but what
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.800]   we see in Scripture.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.500]   So, again, generally, remember we talked about the three separate judgments?
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.540]   You could take that as the seven, and then another seven, and another seven, 21 years
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.220]   consecutively, or seven consecutively, or it could be one, two, three, four, five, six,
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.060]   seven, and then it's basically all three judgments are talking about the same period, except
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.040]   that it's just talking about different aspects.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.300]   But the way we approached it, the way I approached it, is that on the seventh one, it opens up
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.460]   the trumpet judgments, and on the seventh trumpet judgment, it opens up the bowl judgment.
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.940]   So, that's the approach that we took in our interpretation.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.300]   So, I'm not going to go through all of it for the sake of time, but remember there are
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.140]   different approaches to this, right?
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.780]   Depending on your perspective on how you interpret this, everything that we studied, the application
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.140]   is going to look very different.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.900]   So, one of the applications or the interpretation was that you would interpret it in a way that
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.980]   everything was fulfilled in the first century, right?
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.660]   Anybody remember what that view was called?
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.640]   The preterist view, right?
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.180]   The historical view is the application of historical, certain historical events all
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.100]   throughout from the very first century until now.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.580]   That's the historical view.
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.900]   So, what we are calling, it's called the futurist view, meaning that most of this stuff is meant
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.780]   to be applied at the end times when Christ comes, during the tribulation, during the
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.700]   millennium, and at the very end.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.340]   So, that was our approach, if you guys remember, okay?
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.740]   So, I'm going to go over 22 chapters, so it's going to be pretty quick, alright?
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.900]   And then I'm going to give you guys the rest of the time to start.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.380]   So, if you remember, chapter one begins with the introduction, and verse three, it says,
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.540]   "Blessed are those who read," again, this is not the exact quote, "or hears and keeps
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.860]   the prophecy of this book of Revelation."
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.460]   And so, the emphasis was not just to read it, not just to hear it, but to obey.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.820]   And we talked about that last week, how he begins with this verse, and Revelation 22
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.820]   ends with it, right?
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.980]   "Blessed are those who obey," or keep this word.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.620]   So, when we think about the various prophecies that we studied, it wasn't just so that we
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.000]   can look at it and say, "Oh, now I understand the end times," but how does that cause us
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   to obey, right?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.300]   And so, that's what it started with.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.420]   And then, the very first vision that he has is the vision of Christ.
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.420]   And Christ is the one who calls John to give him the vision so that he can take it to the
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.420]   church.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.900]   So, chapter one begins with a detailed description of who Christ is.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   Chapter two and three gives us the seven different churches, right?
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.940]   Anybody remember which was the Lukewarm Church?
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.100]   Which was the church that, two churches that weren't rebuked?
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.100]   Samaritan and Philadelphia.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.100]   Samaritan and Philadelphia.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.100]   Good, you did your homework.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.100]   Okay.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.820]   Which is the church that lost their first love?
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.380]   Okay, Church of Ephesus.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.740]   All right, let's see if you remember this one.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.100]   Which is the church that has a reputation of being alive, but was dead?
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.100]   Sardis.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.100]   Okay.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.660]   So, we have the seven different churches.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.780]   If there is any unifying thing about all of them, it was that God promises that those
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.260]   who overcome, that He was going to give eternal life, right?
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.980]   Meaning He perseveres to the end.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.540]   So, the letters are written and everything in the content of the book of Revelation was
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.100]   meant to be distributed in the seven churches.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.100]   Okay?
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.140]   So, this was not meant for any one particular church.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.700]   This was universal in scope.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.100]   So, He wasn't dealing with any one particular problem, one particular church.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.900]   Because the whole letter was supposed to be read.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.900]   Okay?
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.840]   Now, of course, all of the New Testament was written for everybody to read.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.140]   But it was addressing a particular problem in Galatia or Philippi or to a particular
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.140]   person.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.780]   But this book, it makes it very clear that it was meant for everybody.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.780]   Okay?
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.620]   That's why the seven different churches are written.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.080]   So, before we get into the seal judgments, remember there's, remember we said scattered
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.620]   throughout these judgments.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.940]   What is the vision that John gets?
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.780]   Before and after.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.640]   What does he see?
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   The throne of God.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.220]   God gives him a picture of heaven.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:20.420]   So, before he begins to reveal the horrific judgment that's coming upon mankind, He always
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.380]   gives him a vision of worship up in heaven.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.380]   About the throne of God, the different creatures out there rotating and declaring His holiness.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.340]   And then, so chapter four is a vision of the throne of God, the 24 elders and how He is
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.340]   being worshipped.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.100]   And then chapter five, if you remember, the lion and the lamb, it begins with the heavens
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.860]   crying because there's no one who is worthy to open up the seal.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.860]   Right?
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.100]   And then they come and they say, "Don't worry, the lion of Judah has come.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.100]   He is worthy."
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.860]   And they turn around and what do they see?
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.860]   The lamb.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.860]   Right?
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.860]   The lamb of God.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.580]   The lion of Judah expressed as the lamb of God and He is worthy.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.580]   Right?
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.620]   So, basically that's the gospel message that Christ, the Son of God comes, takes on human
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.500]   form, gives Himself as a ransom for many.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.740]   So, we see that gospel picture in chapter five.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.820]   And how does chapter five end?
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.220]   With worship of the lamb.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.220]   Right?
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.900]   So, chapter four is the worship of God and chapter five is the worship of the lamb.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.700]   And then, so what happens after this?
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.660]   The seal judgments open up.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.980]   Right?
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.460]   And I'm not going to ask you to remember all of the different seals, but because we
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.060]   went through this the first time, remember what the first seal?
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.900]   We had the four horses.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.900]   Right?
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.900]   The white horse.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.860]   Do you remember what was next?
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.980]   The red horse, black horse, and then a pale horse.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.980]   Right?
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.180]   And each of them representing different things.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.660]   Famine, death, right?
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.660]   War.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.460]   So, it represented different things.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.740]   And then the fifth seal, what does it open up?
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.980]   You get a vision of those who've been martyred.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.980]   Right?
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.980]   At the temple.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:17.820]   And then, and then, yes, and then the sixth, and then the seventh seal opens up in chapter
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.540]   seven and then we see the 144,000.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.980]   Again, remember the six seals?
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.740]   After the judgment is done, the seventh seal opens the door and the first vision before
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.620]   they go into the trumpet judgments is again, worship.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.620]   Right?
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:42.820]   144,000, 12,000 in each tribe making up 144,000 Jews, the Israelites, and then behind them,
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.900]   who are they?
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.260]   The Gentiles.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.860]   Representing the world.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.620]   So he sees, after the seal judgment, he sees again, he sees the throne of God, he sees
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.700]   God being worshipped, then after that vision starts the trumpet judgment.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.700]   Right?
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.620]   So the seventh seal judgment opens up the seventh trumpet judgments.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.380]   In chapter eight, it goes, right, and what was, what was the key quality of the trumpet
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.380]   judgments?
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.380]   Anybody?
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:17.900]   There's two things.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:24.300]   One is it's geared toward the earth, not directly toward man.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.740]   Man suffers as a result of it.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:31.700]   So there's earthquakes, there's all these other things that judgment is coming upon
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.700]   the earth, but it's not directly toward them.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.700]   Right?
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.500]   And the second, remember the number, a third?
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.380]   A third of this, a third of that.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.380]   Right?
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.380]   So it's not a complete judgment.
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.340]   So remember, when we were going through the seven trumpet judgments, what was the intent
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.140]   of God?
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.700]   He's still waiting for repentance.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.140]   He's giving them an opportunity.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.100]   So the whole earth is not wiped out yet.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.780]   That doesn't happen until the woes.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.780]   Remember three woes that come later on?
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.260]   Right?
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.300]   So this is the first of the woes.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.400]   Right?
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:16.180]   You have the first one, two, three, four, four trumpet judgments, and then the fifth
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.700]   trumpet judgment opens up where the one who has the key to the abyss, he comes out and
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.540]   he forms an army.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.260]   And it's a demonic army.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.580]   And remember when we talked about how the locust judgment in the book of Joel, that
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.060]   the locust judgment oftentimes refers to utter and complete destruction?
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:40.380]   So again, if you look at each of the judgments, there's an escalation of each one of the judgments.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.300]   Now we've gotten to the point where he says that three woes are coming, and then the first
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:50.260]   woe is a demonic army that comes in the form of, again, whether there's going to be a literal
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:55.980]   locust or not, but the devastation is going to become more and more devastating.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.020]   Chapter 10, you have an angel.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:05.020]   Remember, what does it signify when it says he had one foot in the sea, one foot on land?
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.780]   Remember when we talked about that?
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.740]   The power.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.260]   He had power, and then he has a scroll, meaning that God had a specific message for him to
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.260]   give.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.260]   Message of judgment.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.260]   Message of judgment.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:22.260]   And then chapter 11, again, this starts out with the measuring of the temple, and then
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.900]   you have the two witnesses in chapter 11.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.260]   So what did the measuring of the temple signify?
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.820]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:36.620]   Why do you take measurements?
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.860]   To rebuild, to restore.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:43.220]   So this is prophetic of how God's temple or his home is going to be restored.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.860]   It's a prophetic about what's coming, right?
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.860]   And then the two witnesses come, and they're very powerful, and at the end of it, what
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.100]   happens?
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.020]   They get overpowered by the beast, right?
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.660]   And then at the very end, they're left out in the open, and everybody is mocking, and
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:07.100]   everybody's horrified, and then after three days, they get back up and they ascend, right?
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.720]   So that's how chapter 11 ends.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.220]   And then the chapter 12, again, which was the session that we started, remember the
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.160]   woman and the dragon?
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.620]   Who did we say that the woman was?
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.460]   Israel.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.460]   Most likely Israel.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.940]   This is not in reference to...
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.900]   What do we say?
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:37.340]   Yeah, we'll get to the second vision with the other woman, but this is not the same.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.500]   In Israel, and the red dragon goes after the seed of the woman because of the...
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.060]   Remember the prophecy in the book of Genesis?
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.900]   The seed of the woman is going to come and crush the head of the serpent?
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:52.220]   And so this is that vision of how they're in conflict, and then God miraculously protects
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.220]   them, right?
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.800]   And so that's that vision in Revelation chapter 12.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:02.240]   So remember, chapter 12, the final bowl judgment doesn't come until chapter 16.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:08.300]   So chapter 12, 13, 14, and 15, they're all kind of a prelude to the severest judgment
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.900]   that's coming at the end, okay?
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:16.480]   So all of this is just kind of giving us a picture of what's happening in human history,
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.880]   how Satan is working, how he's battling to defy what God is doing, and he's trying to
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.100]   hinder the gospel work.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.960]   And so all of that is pictured in chapter 12 and chapter 13.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:35.240]   So remember chapter 13, it talks about after the red dragon, right?
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.200]   We have the first beast and the second beast.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.080]   Who did we say the first beast was?
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.360]   Who's the first beast in chapter 13?
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.320]   Antichrist.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:53.240]   What does Antichrist do to get popularity from people?
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.880]   He mutates Christ.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   How does he mutate Christ?
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:05.000]   Right, he said it seemed like he had a mortal wound, but he doesn't die from it.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.360]   He comes back to life.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.760]   And he said everybody marvels because of that, and as a result of it, they go after him.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.280]   And then when they go after him, what does he do?
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.180]   He points to the dragon, right?
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.480]   So he gives glory to the dragon.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.560]   And then the second beast represents what?
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.460]   False prophets, right?
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.280]   And then who did we say that these three mimic?
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.600]   Right, the Holy Trinity.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.200]   So if you remember, we looked at each of the works that they were doing and how each one
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   of them, and then the third one is mimicking the Holy Spirit, how it gives life and it
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.500]   gives spirit.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.880]   And so you look at the work of Satan, how it's trying to match the work of the Trinity,
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.100]   how the Antichrist is doing the work like to deceive.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.500]   And when he deceives and gets the glory, he points it back to the Father.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:03.020]   And then the whole work of the false prophet is to deceive people and then lead them to
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.900]   the Antichrist, right?
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.340]   And then Antichrist ultimately gives glory to the dragon, right?
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.820]   So that's what we saw in chapter 13.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:18.500]   In chapter 14, the beast, again, begins to have relation.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.300]   Again, the reason why I put the beauty and the beast is because it refers to Babylon.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:28.420]   And what was the lure of the Babylon?
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:38.460]   Remember, there's one particular sin that kept on coming up over and over.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.580]   I had no idea what you just said.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.580]   Sexual immorality.
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.580]   So remember, we saw that.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:51.140]   They kept on repeating over and over again how the Babylonian kingdom, the primary thing
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:56.460]   that gets mentioned over and over again, it doesn't necessarily just mean sexual sin,
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.980]   but sexual immorality is referring to any kind of lust rebellion.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:07.220]   So the Bible talks about how the nation of Israel, when it goes after idols, he calls
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.500]   them what?
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.700]   Harlots, right?
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.900]   Committing adultery.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.220]   So sexual immorality isn't just talking about sex.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.700]   It's obviously sexual immorality is part of it, but it's anything that is in rebellion
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.220]   against God, in idolatry, right?
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:27.260]   And so Babylon, remember, the Assyrians, they conquered in fear.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.500]   They would come, totally dominate, and they would put fear in people and make them tremble.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.460]   So they would be, they were known for their cruelty.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:41.180]   But the Babylonians, once they conquered, they treated them so well that they didn't
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.180]   want to be.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.180]   They wanted to be Babylonians.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.180]   Remember that?
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.180]   Right?
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.020]   And remember how we were studying the book of Israel?
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.260]   Israel kind of, not Israel, Isaiah?
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.500]   Isaiah kind of highlights.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.580]   And if you look at Israel's history, the problem with Israel's history was once they went into
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.100]   captivity and God allows them to come back, majority of them don't come back.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.220]   They assimilate and they just disappear.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:10.100]   So in the book of Revelation, when the attraction of the Babylonians, it wasn't by force, it
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.740]   wasn't by fear, it was through temptation.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.740]   Right?
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:20.340]   So the beast and the beauty is working together.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.100]   So chapter 15, we see, again, they see a vision of heaven.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.940]   And in the vision of heaven, it says that the bulls, the seven angels with seven bulls
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.500]   are coming out from there.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.260]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:38.660]   This signifies the intensity of this judgment that this is directly coming from God's throne,
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.740]   that God has direct hand on it.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:47.620]   Not that the other ones was not, but again, this vision reveals that God is directly targeting.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.980]   And this is the third woe.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.660]   The seven bull judgments is the third woe that was mentioned.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.660]   Right?
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.780]   Meaning that the intensity is increasing.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.220]   And in each of these bulls, it was unlike the other judgments so far.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.220]   Right?
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.700]   Do you remember why it was different?
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.460]   Chapter 16 is just kind of rapid fire.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:14.180]   What was different between the bull judgments and then the other two judgments?
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:22.180]   Obviously, it was more intense, but what made it more intense?
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:33.140]   All the other judgments up to this point, it was God's judging the earth and mankind
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.580]   is affected as a result of it.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.820]   But even in the midst of that, God is hoping and he's giving opportunity for people to
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.980]   repent.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:47.300]   When this, when the bull judgment comes, the angel makes it clear, right, that he will
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   not delay.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.500]   Remember, he keeps saying he will not delay, he will not delay.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.820]   Meaning that the final judgment is coming and he's referring to the bull judgments.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.500]   And the bull judgment is severe because it is final.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.860]   There's nothing after that.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.980]   After that is the end.
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.140]   There is no waiting for people to repent and come back.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.940]   And this judgment is directly targeted to people.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.020]   Right?
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:14.060]   And remember, up to now, we're talking about a third, where here it's utter devastation.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.060]   Right?
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.060]   Whatever it is.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:24.300]   The seven judgments that we see is, remember, the people who have the mark of the 666, they
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.940]   all had boils.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:32.400]   And then remember that this is the sea, the open waters, and this is the springs.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.840]   And this is the sun's going to scorch the people.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.420]   And then the demonic kingdom is going to be directly targeted.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.340]   And darkness is going to come over them.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:47.020]   And then there's going to be a famine where the Euphrates River dries up.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.020]   Right?
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.220]   Remember the significance of this?
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.660]   We talked about that.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.480]   This is just our interpretation.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.500]   But that when that thing dries up, that there's going to be no boundary between Israel and
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.500]   their enemies.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.380]   And possibly that that is in preparation for the Armageddon, the final battle that's going
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.540]   to take place.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.500]   And then the final part of it is going to be an intense earthquake that's going to divide
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.300]   the Holy Land in three parts.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:14.020]   And then whatever was not affected by the earthquake, there's going to be hail to come
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.300]   and bring judgment upon mankind.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.300]   Okay?
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.500]   So, again, it's going to be intense, it's going to be thorough, and it's going to be
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   final.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:27.500]   And which makes it different than the other judgments that we saw.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.180]   Chapter 17 is the dragon and the woman.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.700]   So this is not the same woman as I think we saw in Chapter 12.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.020]   So again, this is representing Babylon.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.860]   Again, I mentioned to you there are some people who think that maybe that's the Catholic Church.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.540]   We don't know that for sure.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:52.400]   But again, there is a union between the dragon, the Antichrist, and the secular kingdom.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.620]   But at the end of Chapter 17, they turn against her.
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.620]   Right?
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.980]   Because they see judgment coming, and then they actually turn against her.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.460]   And then they kind of separate.
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.940]   And then Chapter 18 is the fall of Babylon.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.380]   So I don't know if you can see it in the picture, but just utter destruction.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.980]   So you know what Chapter 19 is, right?
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:18.780]   After Chapter 18, what happens?
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.060]   We're at the end, so.
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.980]   Second coming of Christ, right?
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:31.060]   So basically the vision is, each of these visions, each step, it gets worse, and it
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:35.900]   gets more devastating, it gets more thorough, and then right before his second coming, before
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.060]   the millennial kingdom, it is utter destruction.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.380]   So Babylon is going to completely fall.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.380]   Right?
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.140]   Whether that's going to be World War III, whether it's going to be natural disaster,
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.040]   but Babylon is judged.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:55.300]   So all the people who are chasing after that, right, and who was marked by the number of
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.460]   the beasts will also be judged along with it.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.620]   It's utter devastation.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.500]   So after this, there is no second chance.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.500]   Right?
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:09.660]   The judgment is going to take place, and after that, the coming of Christ, the marriage lamb
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.140]   is coming.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:16.620]   And we talked about how this will inaugurate the coming of the millennial kingdom, where
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.820]   Christ is going to come, resurrection is going to take place, and then people are going to
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.520]   enter into this thousand-year reign of Christ.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.300]   And during that period, right, Satan is bound for a thousand years.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.420]   So Satanic work of deception is going to be gone for a thousand years, and at the end
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.620]   of the thousand years, he will be released, and he will deceive for a period, but very
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.900]   short period.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.900]   Right?
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.900]   And he's going to try to come and challenge God, and God's going to squash him immediately,
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.060]   and then at the end of that comes what?
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.700]   The white throne judgment.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.700]   Right?
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.780]   Okay, so we enter the millennium, and then at the end of the millennium, there's a white
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.380]   throne judgment, where the final judgment takes place, and after the final judgment,
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.900]   we enter into the new heaven and new earth.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.900]   Right?
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.420]   And, again, this should be fresh in your mind, because it wasn't too long.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:11.300]   So chapter 21 and 22, part of chapter 22 is a description of the new heaven and new earth
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.380]   that's coming.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:19.540]   And we said that it was a physical kingdom, that the kingdom is going to be, the millennial
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.140]   kingdom is going to be restored back to what God intended, right?
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.300]   And we're going to have resurrected bodies, we're going to have physical bodies, but it's
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.300]   going to be like Christ's resurrected body.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.620]   So what we see in Christ after the resurrection is the same body we're going to have, and
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.620]   so most likely the heaven is going to reflect that.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.620]   Okay?
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.140]   New heaven and new earth.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:48.700]   And then the second coming of Jesus, again, this is not the description of the chapter,
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.060]   but the book ends with the description of Christ's coming.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:58.740]   And he says, "He who adds to this or subtracts from that, God will add plagues to him."
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.940]   In other words, it ends with anticipation of his second coming, right?
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.940]   So it begins, and then it calls us to obedience.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.140]   It calls us to obedience in the beginning, it calls us to obedience in the end.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:15.940]   His intent was that through this prophecy, that it would cause the church to be awake,
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:21.100]   to live soberly, that we would not chase after the world that's going to be under judgment.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:27.620]   So the picture that we saw in chapter 18 is basically where all that we know, all that
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.780]   the word value is headed toward, right?
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.100]   Now when we read Book of Revelation, it's like, "Well, it sounds like a fairy tale,"
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:40.180]   but when you actually see the application, like look at the world, do most people believe
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.420]   that this world is deteriorating and it's going to end, whether it's going to be a,
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.460]   you know, like nuclear bomb or maybe the ozone layer, maybe it's going to be whatever it
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.540]   may be.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.420]   I think scientifically, most people know that the earth is going to somehow die.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.700]   We just don't know when, right?
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.020]   Either we're going to destroy it or naturally it's just going to be destroyed.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:08.900]   So the fact that the world is headed toward that, right, is not debated.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.980]   The only thing that's debated is if you don't believe God, you don't believe that God has
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.780]   any hand in that, right?
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.820]   But we know that just as we, just like we said, we didn't come from amoebas that just
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.740]   decided one day to have a brain and then started walking.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:27.900]   We know that God had specific hands in His creation, and so we also know through the
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:33.460]   Book of Revelation that the end is also going to be determined by God the Creator, that
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.460]   He is sovereign in the creation, He is sovereign in what we're doing, and He is sovereign at
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.460]   the end.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.020]   And so that's how the Bible pictures it, okay?
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.980]   So that's, again, in a nutshell, maybe a year from now you're not going to remember all
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:51.300]   the details, but at least you kind of have some idea when you think of the Book of Revelation
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.940]   that you don't just get confused.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.380]   It's like, "Oh, I don't know what's going on in Revelation," right?
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:04.140]   I really want to encourage you to, not just today, but at some point, go through it through
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.140]   your devotions.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.260]   And I know Revelation is not like, "Oh, I'm doing quiet time, you know, verse by verse
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.740]   through the Book of Revelation," but hopefully this gave you enough so that you wouldn't
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.380]   be completely lost when you did through it.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.260]   And I guarantee you, this is my third time teaching through Revelation, and I gained
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.300]   much more through this third time than I did the first two times.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:27.260]   And the reason why is because sometimes you go through a rabbit trail and you ask a lot
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.460]   of questions that kind of doesn't have clear answers, and then you just get confused.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:39.240]   So I realize that the Book of Revelation really is meant to be studied like if you're looking
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.380]   at a drawing or some kind of a painting.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:50.140]   I don't know if you've, and I'm not artsy in any way, but there's some kind of paintings
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.060]   where you could see the painting and you can see the emotion behind the painter.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.700]   You can see if they're sad.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.700]   You can see if they're excited.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.300]   You can see if they're lonely or angry, right?
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.200]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.980]   You know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:11.560]   So there are certain type of emotions that are better expressed through painting.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   You don't need words.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   You don't need poetry.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.040]   Just when you look at the painting, you can see what was in that person's mind and heart
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.760]   because it leaves an impression.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:25.200]   And I think the Book of Revelation was meant to be understood that way, that the vision
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.720]   that John has is not like every single thing we try to dissect and we don't understand.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.920]   They're like, "Why is it green here?
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   Why is it blue here?
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.700]   Why did he use upstroke and not downstroke here?"
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.600]   I think it was meant as a whole picture to make an impression.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.960]   And this impression is pretty obvious.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.120]   When anybody studies the Book of Revelation, the impression is God is on His throne.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.440]   He's absolutely sovereign.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:55.000]   No matter how chaotic things may be, God is completely in control and He is being worshipped.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.300]   There is an end to man's history, that all that seems attractive and beautiful at one
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.920]   point, there's going to be an end and it's going to be utter destruction.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.520]   And judgment is going to come.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.160]   And heaven is going to be beautiful.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:16.240]   That all that we've been looking for and all that we temporarily chase, the real fulfillment
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.960]   is in Christ when He comes in His second kingdom.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.800]   These are big pictures that every single one of these visions, in one of those main themes,
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.080]   it leaves an impression.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.840]   So when we think about judgment, we don't just think about what He says.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.240]   We think about the picture.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.800]   Remember all the pictures that we saw?
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.600]   You just Google it.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:44.620]   Somebody at some point in history has painted every single scene of the Book of Revelation.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.960]   So that when you think about the seven seals, you're not just thinking about verbally.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.120]   Like we think about Ephesians, we think of chapter 3, chapter 4, chapter 5.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.780]   But Revelation, you see a painting that made an impression.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.880]   So you have some idea of what judgment may look like.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.440]   And so all the things that we're talking about would have, again, not just mentally, but
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:11.520]   emotionally and willfully have an impact on the way that we live our Christian life.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.880]   The rest of the time, I'm going to ask you guys to, in your small group, take some time
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.600]   for discussion.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   One is, what is the general outline of the Book of Revelation?
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.640]   Make it as broad as possible, no more than five or six titles.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:30.160]   So maybe chapter 1 through 3 would be the introduction and the three churches or six,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   seven churches.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.580]   And then you have chapter 4 and chapter 5.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.640]   You have the seals and chapter 6.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.200]   Some broad outlines.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.640]   So that if I said chapter 14, you don't say third seal.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.440]   You kind of have an idea of what's in there.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:52.760]   So when I say, what chapter are all the bold judgments?
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.840]   Chapter 16.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.280]   So bold judgments is all concentrated in one chapter.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.640]   The trumpet judgments are scattered in like three or four chapters.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.160]   And then the seal judgments are, again, in one chapter, and only one of it is the next
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.160]   chapter.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.160]   So just kind of get a broad idea.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.620]   So you don't need to spend too much time on that, just so that you have some idea.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:19.120]   If I said chapter 18, chapter 14, chapter 12, you have some idea what is in there.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.360]   Number two, what are some similarities and distinctions between the seal, trumpet, and
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.200]   bold judgments?
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.240]   So these are study questions.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:34.840]   Thirdly, what is the general impression, how is the demonic work generally described in
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   Revelation?
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   List three or four observations.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.880]   So I'm not talking about just one chapter.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.400]   You don't have to go skim through it.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.260]   Just in your memory, what is an impression that was made based upon Scripture, of what
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.860]   the Scripture says demonic work is going to look like?
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.220]   Four, what is the general impression of God's judgment at the end times?
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.260]   Give two or three observations.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:00.180]   So what are some things that you remember from that?
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.700]   What was one theme that kept coming up throughout the visions that John saw throughout the letter?
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.700]   List three or four.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:13.520]   For me, the biggest thing that, at least for this time around, was God sitting on his throne.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.080]   That's the theme that I kept saying over and over, at least in my mind.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.400]   So what are some things that kind of made an impression on you?
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.360]   And then six, describe heaven in one sentence.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:28.320]   If maybe every person in your table, at least just one sentence, how would you describe
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.760]   heaven based upon what you've read and what you've studied?
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.320]   So I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to discuss that.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:44.880]   Richard, are you able to put the next, like put, can you put the third one, or this one
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.720]   on these screens and then the last one on the middle screen?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.280]   Is that possible?
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   Okay.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   All right.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:58.620]   So the next question, discussion question, is basically was your homework.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:04.600]   So if you are done discussing, take some time to, this is more of an application, like what
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.320]   did you personally learn about God, about yourself, about sin?
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.040]   And so take some time to discuss that as well as you wrap up.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.040]   Okay.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.760]   So I'm going to pray and we're going to finish and I'm going to let you guys go to your groups.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.680]   But after we're done, we don't need to put away the chairs.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.980]   We don't need to put away the tables.
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.040]   We just need to clean up.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.480]   So we just need to put the trash away and then throw it away.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.360]   The college students also have their meeting here this Friday, so we're just going to leave
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.360]   it the way it is.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.360]   Okay.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.360]   All right.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.360]   Let me pray for us.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:39.800]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:46.480]   We thank you, Lord God, for the Holy Spirit that continues to teach and guide.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.760]   We pray that you would open our eyes and help us to glean from the things that you've already
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.400]   implanted in our hearts and mind.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.960]   I pray that you would bless our small group time, help us to be honest and open with one
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.400]   another and that as iron sharpening iron, that we may be sharpened as a result of the
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   time that we have together.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.400]   Amen.
