[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 2, 14 to 18.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.520]   Hebrews chapter 2, 14 to 18.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.320]   Reading out of the NASB, "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, and
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.880]   he himself likewise also partook of the same, it might free those who through fear of death
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.420]   were subject to slavery all their lives.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.880]   For surely he does not give help to angels, but to give help to the descendants of Abraham.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.180]   Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things, so that he might become a merciful
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.060]   and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.160]   of the people.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.000]   For since he himself was tempted in that which he has suffered, he is able to come to the
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.720]   aid of those who are tempted."
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.720]   Let's pray.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:06.320]   Gracious and merciful Father, we thank you so much for not only today, but this whole
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.480]   season Lord God, that we take time off to remember, to spend time with family.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.400]   But above all Lord, help us to understand the significance of what this day represents.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.920]   I pray that you would renew our mind, renew our appreciation for what it is that we have.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.480]   Knowing Father God that the throne of grace has been opened to us, that we may enter with
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.840]   confidence, so that what we know and what we hear, Father God, would cause us a longing
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.160]   and desire, Father, to connect with you.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.800]   And so we pray for that blessing.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.840]   We pray, Father, that your word would go forth and would not return until it has accomplished
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   its purpose.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.800]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.480]   You know, a couple of weeks ago I got together with my old college roommates.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.800]   And even though I was roommates with them for about four or five years, majority of
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.380]   them, of the five, three or four of them, are more than 10 years older than me.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.440]   And so they're right now, they're spread all over the world.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.240]   I have a missionary friend who's in Kenya, another one goes back and forth to China,
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.080]   another one in Indonesia.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.400]   And I remember when we were back in college, we would have dinner together and they would
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.440]   always talk about their aging parents, because they were older than I was.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.440]   And so I would just sit there and listen, because obviously I wasn't at that stage yet.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.200]   But now when we get together, they're always talking about retirement, you know, because
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.000]   they're a little bit more closer to retirement.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.240]   And so, you know, the conversations they have, and I usually sit there and just listen.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.440]   And last time we met, they talked about preventing Alzheimer's and how if you eat curry, that
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.840]   somehow that helps with the Alzheimer's.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.660]   And I said, okay, I'll take a note and I'll remember that for the future.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.360]   This time we got together and they're kind of talking about, you know, the steps that
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.540]   they're taking for retirement, because they're 60, 61.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.240]   And so the Indonesian friend is coming back in about a year.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.200]   And then he's not retiring, but he's retiring from mission field in Indonesia, and then
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.360]   he's going to be doing work back here.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.920]   And same thing with my friend in Kenya, he's kind of taking steps as he gets closer to
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.640]   63, 64, and he's coming back.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.840]   But you know, every time we gather together, you know, I've had many friends in the past,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.280]   but those roommates that I had, you know, every time, whether we meet once a year or
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.640]   every couple of years, when they come back in furlough, you know, it's like old times,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.280]   you know, back when we lived together, we spent about three to four, maybe five years
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.000]   together, living together.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.440]   So we have obviously very specific memories that we have, praying together, witnessing
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.920]   together, spending late nights just talking.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.280]   So again, even though they're significantly older than I am, they're good friends that
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.460]   we're probably going to keep in touch for the rest of our lives.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.760]   And again, it's special because they were roommates at one point in my life, even though
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.720]   it was a short period, it's been many years ago.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.560]   Christmas that we celebrate is a day that we celebrate the God of the universe made
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.640]   a dwelling among us.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.560]   In John chapter 114, it says, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us."
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.660]   The word dwelt literally means to pitch a tent.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.320]   To pitch a tent at that time is not talking about how they took some time off and went
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.040]   camping, kind of like the way we would look at tent.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.160]   A tent basically means a dwelling, a place, a home.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.560]   So when it says that Christ came and made a home among us, He didn't just come and visit
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   us for a period.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.880]   It means that He stayed.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.480]   He became roommates, intimate roommates with mankind.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.360]   That's the day that we celebrate in Christmas.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.280]   But the natural question that we should be asking, because the world is most likely asking
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.920]   that question, do you actually believe that?
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.080]   That the God of the universe took on human flesh and He dwelt here for a period before
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.520]   He was resurrected and ascended?
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.240]   Do you actually believe that?
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.960]   If you have even a little bit of doubt of that, you're not alone.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.820]   Because according to scripture, even Jesus' closest companions had a problem.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.420]   They had a difficult time believing it.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:10.240]   We see that even His brother, in John 7, 3-5, when Jesus' ministry just started to take
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.960]   off, they came to Him.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.840]   His brother comes to Him, brothers come to Him and says, "Leave here and go into Judea
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.440]   so that your disciples also may see your works which you are doing.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.200]   For no one does anything in secret when he himself seeks to be known publicly.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.240]   If you do these things, show yourself to the world.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.160]   For not even his brothers were believing in him."
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.820]   His own brothers.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.900]   As Jesus' popularity was growing, started doubting, "How can you?
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.080]   We saw you all our lives.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.520]   How can you all of a sudden show up and say you're that Messiah?"
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.000]   His hometown people in Luke chapter 4, 22.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.700]   People are speaking well of Him and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.220]   His lips and they were saying, "Is this not Joseph's son?
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.640]   They knew His humanity, but how can this man that we knew, we know His father, we know
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.580]   His mother, how can He be any different than us?"
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.880]   So Jesus' closest companions were the first ones who doubted Him.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.840]   Mark chapter 3, 21 to 22, He says, "When His own people heard this, they went out to take
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   custody of Him."
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.240]   So some of your translation says His own family members.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.880]   It basically means somebody who was very close to Him, whether it's family members or His
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.520]   hometown people.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.440]   When they began to hear and see what He was doing, again, they were the first ones who
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440]   rejected Him.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.200]   He said, "He's lost his senses.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.240]   The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, 'He is possessed by Beelzebul and
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.960]   casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.'"
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.920]   So generally across the board, when we look at the gospels superficially, we think like
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.320]   everybody was running to Him, believing Him and wanted to make Him king.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.280]   But when you take a closer look at the gospels, it is the historical record of a systematic
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.040]   rejection of Christ all the way up to the cross.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.920]   It is summarized in John chapter 1, 10.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.840]   It says, "He was in the world and the world was made through Him and the world did not
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.200]   know Him.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   He came to His own and those who are His own did not receive Him."
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.400]   So if you have any doubts, if you've ever questioned the story of Christmas, that is
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.600]   this actually real, you're not alone.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.160]   Because even Jesus' close companion, even the ones who knew Him the best, in the beginning
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.680]   asked those questions.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.080]   But if you look at the gospel account, you'll see that that trend changes radically after
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.320]   the resurrection of Christ.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.520]   So clearly, after the resurrection, you see tens of thousands of people coming to Christ
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.240]   because there's hundreds of eyewitnesses who saw the resurrection and Thomas being the
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.720]   first one saying, "My Lord, my God," and began to worship Jesus and that began to spread.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.840]   Everywhere they went, Apostle Paul went, there were already Christians there beginning to
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   share the gospel.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.560]   It began to spread like wildfire.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.500]   And as His deity was confirmed through His resurrection, the second stage of problems
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:09.260]   that they had was, clearly He must be God, but how can He be man?
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.480]   So they began to come up with this theory that maybe He only came in the form of man,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.520]   but He wasn't really man.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.320]   Maybe there was an illusion of a man, but He wasn't really man.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.940]   But because how can God be man?
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.200]   So the epistle of 1 John and 2 John, those two letters are written to deal with that
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.760]   problem.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   That if you reject the humanity of Christ, that He came in the flesh, that you will reject
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.320]   Christ.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.120]   And then again, tens and a decade and a couple centuries go by, and then the resurrection
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.540]   of Christ and His miracles just become stories.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.920]   And so the next stage of church history, they go back to the beginning, and it's clearly
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   Jesus, the historical figure, we know Him because there's evidence of Him.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.840]   But did He actually resurrect?
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   Was He really God?
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.260]   So for a long stretch in church history, they began to debate again, was He really God?
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.840]   Maybe He was a created being.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.200]   Maybe He was something like that.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.720]   Maybe He was kind of like God, but maybe He isn't God.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.120]   And so this went back and forth all throughout church history.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.360]   Was He truly human?
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.680]   Was He truly God?
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:24.240]   Understandably, we can understand why they ask this question.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:30.080]   They ask this question because the paradox that we find in Christ.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.640]   Because to be human means to be imperfect.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.780]   Isn't that what we mean when we say, "Oh, He's only human," right?
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.520]   Or you make a mistake and somebody accuses you of something, you say, "Well, I'm only
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.520]   human."
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.520]   Right?
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.480]   What we mean is we're imperfect.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.640]   You couldn't have possibly expected perfection from me or from you because we're only human.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.320]   So the very nature of saying that somebody is a human being, he's imperfect.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.920]   Now on the other spectrum, we could say, "You think you're God?
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.120]   What do we mean by that?
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.440]   You think you're perfect?
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.000]   You think you're above everybody else?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.240]   You think you're holy?"
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.520]   And so you have these two spectrums, just even in our average use of our language, to
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.280]   be human means to be imperfect.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.080]   To be God means to be perfect.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.840]   So how can someone who is perfect take on an imperfect form?
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.800]   And that's the paradox of Christmas.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:38.280]   That this God who is perfect took on human form and He walked among us.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.640]   I want to look at a passage together with you in Hebrews chapter 2, 14 to 18, to dive
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:50.080]   into the significance of this paradox and how it explains to us why this was necessary
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.880]   and how Jesus took this on.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.920]   So Hebrews chapter 2, 14 to 18, I read this already so I'm not going to read it, but there's
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.040]   three observations that I want to emphasize with you this morning about this paradox of
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.840]   Christmas and what it teaches us.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:11.720]   First of all, it says that Jesus took on human form in order to sympathize with our weakness.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.400]   In order to sympathize with our weakness.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.920]   Hebrews chapter 4, 15 says, "In every way He became like us, except," what?
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.880]   He didn't sin.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   Except He didn't sin.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:29.360]   So where that paradox that I just explained to you falls apart is, when we mean I'm only
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.880]   human, we're referring to the fallen nature of man.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.960]   The Bible describes Jesus Christ coming as the second Adam before the fall.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.040]   So in every way He was human except sin.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:50.360]   And He says He came in this way in order for Him to sympathize with our weakness.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.400]   In every way Christ experienced what you and I experience without sinning.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.620]   We know that He went hungry, the Bible describes that.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.960]   We know that He was tired, fatigued.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.040]   Fatigued to the point where there was a storm and His disciples thought that they were going
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.320]   to die and Jesus was so tired He couldn't even get up.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.600]   I don't think He was playing a trick.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.080]   I don't think He was sleeping with one eye open saying, "I'm going to teach these guys
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.440]   something today."
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.600]   I think He was that dead tired.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.200]   He experienced fatigue in ministry.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.120]   He actually was marveled when He encountered certain people's faith.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.000]   Now you don't see that.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.740]   My God of the universe who's omnipotent, why should He marvel?
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.740]   He knows all things.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.340]   But Jesus in His humanity at times He marveled at people's faith.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.860]   We saw Him in anguish before He went to the cross.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.340]   In His humanity, even though it was ordained, even though He volunteered, He lays His own
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.720]   life down and He raises it back up.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.500]   Before He goes to the cross we see Christ agonizing over the pain and the separation
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.540]   that He knows is coming.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.000]   In His humanity He experienced this anguish.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.200]   He experienced sorrow.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   We see Him before the tomb of Lazarus after His death, Him weeping in sorrow.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.920]   He's headed down to Jerusalem and He sees all of the city and He knows the judgment
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:19.280]   that's coming upon them because of their rejection and He is weeping over the city.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.680]   He has experienced physical and emotional isolation and loneliness and everything that
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:32.200]   you and I experience in this fallen world, Jesus took on human form that He may be a
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.600]   sympathetic high priest toward us.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.480]   There's a reason why when Jesus speaks parables, He would teach a lesson about the kingdom
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.760]   and then He would teach a parable and typically the parables centered around what?
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   Agriculture.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.040]   I mean I don't know how many of you were raised in a farm but the majority of us probably
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.040]   were not.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.460]   So we kind of have to imagine what it was like on the farm but at that time in order
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.960]   to relate what He was saying about the kingdom to them, He would use the illustration of
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.960]   the farm, whether it's raising sheep or trees or whatever it may be and He talks a
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.720]   lot about different seasons because that's where the farmers were used to.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:18.120]   And so He went out of His way to be able to relate to them as they can relate to Him.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.760]   So every Sunday when I give a message, you know I have to do the same thing.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.600]   So I have this truth that I've been studying and so after I study, so people usually ask
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.080]   me, "Are you done with your sermon?"
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.660]   Sermon, anybody who's ever given sermon on a regular basis, you know sermon is never
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.480]   done until you preach it.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.640]   And the reason why is because you can take the truth but then taking the truth and applying
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.520]   it to the congregation, there is no science behind that, it's more art.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.280]   Like how do I get this so that our congregation can understand this?
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.800]   The easy part is to know the truth but how do you get this truth to you?
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:57.000]   So I have to think what are things that I can relate to that could help you to understand?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.320]   So sometimes I'll think about like movie illustrations, which I think are current,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.840]   oftentimes they're not, right?
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   And I make sure that I use language that I think people can relate to.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.960]   There are certain things that I know that it's easy for me to make connection because
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.440]   we have common experience, right?
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.160]   Any PKs in here?
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.320]   Those of you guys who aren't PKs, don't even know what a PK is.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.480]   Pastor's kit, basically that's, if you're a PK, you grew up in a PK home and all the
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.840]   stuff that you saw growing up, I immediately, I know where you come from because that's
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.560]   our experience.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.600]   Any middle children in this room?
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   Middle children?
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   Okay.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.320]   If you're a PK and middle children, I get you, okay?
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.000]   I asked this in the first service and if you ask how many firstborn children, the arms
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.800]   go up immediately, like in pride.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.640]   Yes, I'm responsible.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.640]   Is that what you're asking?
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.560]   Like that's what they hear.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.600]   But if you say any middle children, any stubborn people in this room that have a hard time
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.920]   getting along, right?
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.480]   That's usually what they hear when they say, "Oh, he's a middle child," right?
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.640]   If you're a middle child and you're a PK, I get you, right?
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.120]   There's a lot of things that I have an easier time relating with you because of your experience
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.200]   and my experience.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.840]   You're a Lakers fan?
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.560]   I get you, right?
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.560]   The suffering that we've been through, right?
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.960]   We're slowly coming out of it.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.680]   We're not there yet, but we're getting there, right?
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.000]   I stayed home with Jeremy, my firstborn son, for about a year and a half because, you know,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.840]   Esther had to work and we had to make a living, and that was the only income that we had.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.840]   So I know what it's like.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.720]   And again, one and a half years doesn't make me an expert in that, but I experienced just
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.880]   enough to know that it wasn't for me, right?
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.840]   Yeah, I would have ruined my kids if I kept this up.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.460]   I mean, other than feeding him and changing him, I did absolutely nothing.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.840]   My goal was that he doesn't die.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.940]   Like that was my goal every single day, you know?
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.600]   And then Esther came home and she delivered him every single day.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.940]   So I understand.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.000]   Even on the surface, it looks like, "Oh, they're just feeding the kids and they go to sleep
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.440]   and they can do whatever they want."
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.040]   There is no break.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.560]   Like, zero.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.860]   You could be dead sick.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.980]   If the child is sick, you have to work.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.980]   There is no break.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.680]   You know, I've worked, I've had jobs before where if you're tired, you're just not a good
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.040]   worker that day.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.800]   You take 20-minute bathroom breaks.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.840]   You go to coffee maybe 15 times.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.760]   There's a ways to adjust how, you know, when you're tired.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.160]   But when you're at home with your kids and your kids are sick, there is no break.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.900]   I get you, right?
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.900]   Even though it's been, it was only for a year and a half, right?
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.680]   I taught ESL in school for about a year and a half.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.360]   No, not a year and a half, five years, sorry.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   Right?
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.320]   I tried to block that out of my mind.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.680]   So I understand.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.880]   I never drank coffee until I started teaching.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.760]   Really, I never drank coffee.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.960]   I didn't feel the need for it.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.080]   I didn't have a taste for it until I started teaching.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.240]   And I realized like when you teach, you know, a lot of people say, "Well, when you teach,
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.180]   you're only there for like five hours and you get three-month break."
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.600]   But when you teach, you know what it felt like?
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.440]   It felt like preaching a five-hour sermon every single day.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.700]   That's what it felt like.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.480]   I was exhausted because I had to sit there.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.260]   You have to, your mind has to be alert the whole time you're up there.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.260]   You can't just casually.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.160]   And again, just like watching kids, you can't just take a 30-minute break.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.840]   You know, when you're teaching, you have to be alert or you're going to lose the class
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.000]   and you're not going to be able to teach well.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.960]   So that's when I started checking coffee because I had to be alert.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   Right?
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.560]   So there's certain things that I've experienced that helps me to understand where you're coming.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.160]   I've had small businesses, you know, and the frustration that comes with that.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.520]   Any minimum wage jobs, you know, that paid really bad and had to work hard, I have a
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.760]   lot of experience in that.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.880]   So I know where you're coming from.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.560]   So every week when I'm preparing a sermon, I'm kind of thinking through these things
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.400]   like how can I relate to the congregation?
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.160]   So Jesus himself, you could tell even the way he teaches, he's always trying to relate
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160]   to the people.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.240]   But Jesus didn't do this from a distance.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.040]   He didn't just think through his personal experiences and I'm going to teach you about
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.840]   agriculture to connect with you.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.400]   He according to scripture, came off of his throne.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.640]   The highest being took on the lowest form and he actually made a dwelling amongst us.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:27.680]   We pitched a tent that he may be able to relate and sympathize with us.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:34.800]   It says in verse 17, "Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things."
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.320]   Sometimes because we imagine Jesus to be more God than man that we think like I can't relate
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   to him.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.600]   He was God.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.120]   He doesn't understand my temptation.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.600]   He doesn't understand my frustration.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:54.440]   See, sometimes we think that we kind of cross this God and man back and forth and when we
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.720]   have a hard time, it's like Jesus can't possibly relate with me.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.280]   Well, the Bible says that he was man in every way without the sin.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.480]   In every way he was a man without sin.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.960]   Those of you who have sibling problems, Jesus knows.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.120]   He had siblings.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   Brother or sister that aggravates you or says the wrong things and always taking your stuff.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.840]   Whatever situation you may be in, maybe even as an adult.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:30.400]   I already told you that Jesus, his brothers were the first ones who rejected him.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.680]   Can you imagine the frustration and loneliness possibly that he felt that he came in knowing
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:43.120]   what he came to do and his own brothers stood and says, "Why don't you go do it over there?"
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.920]   Sarcastically, "Why don't you go and do this with your disciples?"
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.640]   They were the first ones who rejected him.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.120]   So do you think that Jesus didn't experience aggravation and frustration, maybe even anger?
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:02.300]   Now you have to understand, anger in and of itself is not described as sin.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:08.880]   In Ephesians 4.26 it says, "Be angry and yet do not sin."
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.540]   Be angry but yet do not sin.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.500]   Do not let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.880]   So do you think that there are many times when Jesus was dealing with his brothers,
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.200]   just angered by the frustration?
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.920]   I mean, think about that.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.760]   Jesus was constantly surrounded by sinners who were being selfish.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.500]   And do you think that didn't bother him at times, was aggravating?
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.680]   The temptation to want to quit and maybe pack up his bag and leave earlier?
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.480]   You think that temptation wasn't there?
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.140]   He said he was tempted in every way.
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.480]   He just didn't give in to his sin.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   If you're a student, it's like, "I can't possibly understand as a student, like all the finals
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.240]   and all the stuff that we go through."
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.960]   I mean, the scripture says that he became an infant and he was at the temple and he
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.600]   was learning.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.480]   And he grew in favor and he grew in wisdom.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:06.020]   Now, if you really think about the context of that.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.440]   The same people that he submitted himself to, to learn, to ask questions.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.440]   The scribes, the Pharisees, the priests.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:21.520]   These were the same people, later on, was going to reject him and crucify him.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.040]   Jesus was infinitely more wiser than these people.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.480]   Jesus was infinitely more knowledgeable than these people.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.640]   And yet he humbled himself and he sat there asking questions as a young man.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.880]   And he began to grow in wisdom, just like any other human being.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.240]   So you think that he doesn't understand the frustration of being a student?
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   Probably better than us.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   He sympathizes.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.680]   How about as a worker?
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:00.120]   It doesn't take long for work to become work.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.680]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.340]   You start in as a freshman, everything is fantastic, you know, and you're enjoying your
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.340]   college life.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.160]   By the time you get to junior year, you start to see the students who are disciplined versus
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.600]   the non-students who are disciplined start to break away.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.180]   And then all of a sudden you're taking 25 units to graduate, you know, because you got
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.860]   to make it and you graduate and then you're praying for jobs.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.920]   So there's a bunch of you guys sitting in here about to graduate, praying, praying,
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   "I got to look for a job.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   I got to look for a job."
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.440]   And then you find a job.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.320]   Fantastic, right?
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.760]   Sometimes it lasts maybe four months, five months.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   If you have a really good job, maybe a year.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.400]   But after that period is out, even if it's your dream job, it eventually becomes labor,
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.640]   right?
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.900]   And then you start to wrestle with this thought of like, "Is this it?
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.080]   This is what I'm going to do the rest of my life?"
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.000]   Think about the athletes, you know?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.240]   I mean, they're living our fantasy, average male fantasies to become an athlete.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.520]   He makes millions of dollars playing the sport that we play.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.360]   We would pay money to play.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.520]   And then when they retire, they ask them, "So why did you retire?
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.640]   You're playing so well."
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.040]   And you often hear the question, "I just didn't have the love anymore."
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.160]   Right?
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.940]   You're playing basketball.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.480]   You're getting millions of dollars.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:29.440]   Every city you go, they treat you like a rock star and you said, "You just lost the love."
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.520]   So even basketball can become labor.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.240]   So obviously, anything that you and I are involved in eventually becomes labor.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.800]   It just becomes work.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.040]   The frustration that also comes along with that.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   What does this mean?
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   Is this the rest of my life?
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.360]   And that's why people go through midlife crisis because they get to a certain point in life.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   And because they've been asking this question for so long, and now all of a sudden, it seems
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.680]   like possibly this might be it.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.240]   You've been living all the way up to that point that's like, "At some point, I'm going
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240]   to have to change.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.520]   At some point, I'm going to do something different."
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.240]   But you get to a certain stage in life, and at that point, you're like, you're going to
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   have to accept it because maybe this is it.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.160]   And so they go through a midlife crisis.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.340]   When we think about Jesus, He came as a carpenter.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.800]   He didn't come as the Caesar of Rome.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.360]   He didn't come as a captain of an army.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.200]   He came as a lowly carpenter.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.760]   You know, oftentimes I hear people talking about how Jesus, because He was perfect, every
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.700]   furniture He made was perfect.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.340]   He probably didn't even have to measure.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.840]   He just cut it, and it was perfect.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.720]   He just boom, boom, boom, boom, and all of a sudden, He put it together, and it was perfect.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.200]   I hear people saying that because Jesus was God.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.680]   Never made any mistakes, right?
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.040]   And then imagine Mary saying, "Why can't you be like your older brother?
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.080]   Because He's perfect," right?
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:01.640]   Jesus was man just like us, and it's not sin to make bad furniture.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.640]   It's not sin.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.000]   He said He was tempted in every way.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.760]   So He didn't have a prestigious job.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.280]   He worked with His hands, and my guess was at times, He probably got tired.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.200]   And I, again, you know, I had a business for a period just to make ends meet, and I was
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.560]   doing car detailing, just manual labor, you know?
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.400]   And I remember this one particular time when it was probably about 100 degrees outside,
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.360]   and each car took about four hours to do.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.920]   And eventually I realized the math didn't add up.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.320]   You know, I could work my tail off, and I would only make maybe a couple thousand a
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   month.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.520]   But at that time, it was enough.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.480]   But I remember this one particular lady asked me to come and wash her car, and I was charging
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:46.440]   me about $60, and it took me about four hours to detail this car.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.240]   So those of you who don't know about detailing, you say, "Why would it take four hours?"
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.200]   Because it's hand wax.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.800]   You have to hand wax it, and inside you have to make sure all the grease in the engine
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:01.480]   is out, and then you take like a fine-toothed brush, and you have to brush between every
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.960]   little crack.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.520]   And so when you're detailing, you're literally detailing, which is torture for me because
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.680]   I'm not a detail-oriented person.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.200]   If it looks good enough, it's good.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.760]   But I had to learn to be detailed because of that.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.440]   So it took me four hours, almost 100-degree weather, and then after it was done, I went
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.600]   up and I went to get paid.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.740]   He said, "Well, let me check out the car."
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:27.200]   She comes down, and then she sees a tiny little sap sitting on the hood.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.520]   And she made a stink about that.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.120]   And that whole time I was thinking, you know, during the time that I finished, I went up
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.480]   to get and bring her down, something fell from the tree, and it was just an easy wipe.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.520]   All I had to do was wipe it off, but she was making a stink.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   What is this?
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.120]   You ruined my car.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.280]   And I was going back and forth with her, and eventually she felt bad, and she gave me the
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.240]   money, but I remember coming away from that and saying, "Wow."
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.240]   You know, even if she tipped me, this is not worth it.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.480]   Do you think that Christ as a carpenter maybe ran into some people who thought that the
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.360]   table wasn't exactly what they wanted?
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.180]   You know, because He's living among sinful people.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.680]   He experienced the frustration of working.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:16.560]   He was tempted in every way, in every way, without sinning, without crossing the line.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.280]   So oftentimes we think of Christ that He can't possibly relate with us because He did everything
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.680]   perfect.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.280]   Everywhere He went, everybody danced and sang and appreciated Him.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.040]   That is not what we see in Scripture.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.560]   He experienced all of that.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.000]   He said, "Well, He was never married.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.400]   He couldn't possibly understand me.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:39.080]   He understood me right up until about 33, and then we get married, and He doesn't understand
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.840]   that."
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:48.160]   The whole illustration in the book of Ephesians about marriage ultimately is to tell us about
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.600]   the marriage between Christ and His church.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:58.800]   So the church was made holy, white, because of His sacrifice.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.000]   I mean, between husband and wife, right?
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.600]   Sometimes the greatest joy comes from marriage, and sometimes the greatest aggravation also
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.080]   comes from marriage.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.520]   You know, men have a tendency to be insensitive.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.700]   I know some of you guys don't fall under that category, right?
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:21.120]   And if you are thinking that right now, you're probably the biggest problem.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.360]   Because we think big picture, you know?
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.600]   Typically, most men think we pay the bills, right?
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.480]   We wash the car, we lift heavy things, and then if a bad guy comes into the house, it's
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   my responsibility.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.000]   So therefore, I'm doing my job.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.240]   We think big picture, right?
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.320]   And then ladies typically are kind of looking at the small things, right?
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.640]   You didn't call me, you went, and you didn't text me, or whatever it might be.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.820]   And so the common complaint from the wives to the husbands is, "You don't care.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.520]   I don't think I matter to you."
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.420]   That's a common complaint that you hear.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:59.600]   Maybe it's not you.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.200]   That's a common complaint that you hear.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.960]   I've had enough marriage counseling that I know that this is kind of a universal issue,
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.280]   right?
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:13.360]   But typically, wives have a right to say that because we're not perfect, and we do make
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   mistakes.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:19.760]   And the husbands, sometimes we get frustrated, but our frustration is not warranted because,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.520]   yeah, there are things that we need to fix.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.960]   But Christ never sinned.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.400]   And yet, the church is constantly asking, "Where are you?
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.820]   How come you don't do this?
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.200]   How come you don't do that?"
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.160]   Do you think Christ understands that frustration?
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.240]   Probably much better than we do.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:50.120]   He's never had children, so he couldn't possibly know.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:55.120]   I mean, who are we?
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.720]   We've become co-heirs with Christ.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.760]   Never adopted children.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:08.000]   You think God understands what it's like to raise sinful children?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.120]   I mean, you know what it feels like, you know?
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.600]   Having children, the greatest joys that you've ever experienced in life is because of your
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.920]   kids.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:25.320]   And the most angry I've ever been in my life was also because of the same kids.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.960]   Frustration, raising sinful children.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.920]   And I know some of you have experienced that.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.520]   Some of you may be experiencing that now.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.160]   That frustration of, like, at your wit's end, you don't know what to do, and yet you love
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.440]   them so much.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.840]   You think God doesn't understand that?
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.320]   You think God doesn't understand your frustration?
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.040]   He says He experienced everything that you and I experience in this fallen world without
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.800]   sinning.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:07.240]   He did all of this to draw near to us so that every emotion, every problem, every situation
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:12.560]   that you are in, we can look up to Him and say, "He knows."
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.040]   He didn't just throw out a net and say, "Hey, everybody come."
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.400]   He came to get us.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:24.120]   See, He came in order for Him to be a sympathetic high priest.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.640]   But the second thing that this says is Jesus' primary reason why He came, why He came to
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:35.560]   be a sympathetic high priest, was to deliver us from the fear of death and all those who
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.320]   are subject to slavery because of this death.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.080]   Now, let's take a step back and ask this question.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.840]   How many people do you know who are living day to day enslaved because they're afraid
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.160]   to die?
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.560]   I don't know that many.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.240]   Unless, unless you know exactly when you're going to die, I don't know that many people
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.440]   who are every day living enslaved because they're afraid that if they don't do this
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.360]   or that, that they're going to die tomorrow.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.400]   You have to understand what He means here.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:13.000]   Because the word for life in the New Testament isn't living forever, bios.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.040]   It's the word zoe.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.840]   So every time the scripture talks about how Jesus came to give life, it's talking about
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.280]   zoe.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.720]   And zoe means to be alive.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:29.060]   So zoe basically means to be united with the author of life where the living water is constantly
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.280]   flowing into that person.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.920]   In season and out of season, there's food coming in to revive you, renew you.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.720]   The Bible says that because of our sins, we've been separated from God and so we no longer
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.920]   have this zoe, this life coming in us.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.080]   So Christ came to renew that zoe.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.160]   So the Bible when it talks about life is talking about zoe, not bios.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.760]   So when He says death, it's the opposite of zoe.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:02.520]   Let me give you the Bible dictionary definition of this word death, thanatos.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.560]   In the New Testament, this sense is applied with more definitiveness to the gospel plan
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.500]   of salvation.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.520]   And as zoe is used to denote the bliss and glory of the kingdom of God, including the
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:19.080]   idea of joyful resurrection, so thanatos is used for the opposite.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.940]   Exclusion from the bliss and glory of the kingdom of God, exclusion from zoe.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.440]   Now let me cross this bridge and try to relate to where you are.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   So basically what he says here is FOMO.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.040]   You guys know what FOMO is?
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.920]   You have to hang around with the right people if you want to know what this is.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.600]   FOMO is what?
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.200]   Fear of missing out.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.800]   So if you don't have social media, this is why you need to get social media.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.280]   Or else these things are coming fast.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   I learned it this year.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.080]   So I'm going to keep using it until you know what it is.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.560]   Because it's related to the incarnation of Christ.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:11.760]   So thanatos is an exclusion from the bliss and glory life of Christ.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:19.480]   So thanatos is the fear of missing out, of zoe.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.280]   Now think about it.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.800]   Think about it.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:30.480]   Man's rebellion is seeking to find life outside of Christ.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.960]   And he desired, God created us to want to live.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.180]   From the moment that we are born, we're sucking, we want to eat something, we want to breathe.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.680]   If we see danger, we stay away from it.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.400]   God has innately put in us a desire, an instinct to live.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:52.000]   But man's rebellion is seeking that outside of God.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.920]   And this fear of missing out, of life, is what causes us to seek the world.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.880]   Think about it.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.600]   Why do immigrants come to the United States?
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.160]   To seek a better life.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.840]   People go to school to get good jobs.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   For what?
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.080]   To have a better life.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.960]   We work hard and make money to do what?
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.480]   To have a better life.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.880]   We eat, we travel, we desire different experiences to what?
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.080]   So that we can feel alive.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:41.160]   And this fear, fear of missing out, has enslaved people all their lives to chase after things
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.840]   that has nothing to do with real life.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.560]   And so Christ came to deliver us from that fear.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:55.000]   He says in John 10.10, "I came that they may have life and that have it abundantly."
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.480]   Again in John 14.6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.720]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.440]   Jesus came to restore this life.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.960]   Third and finally, Jesus came to deliver us ultimately from our sins.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.280]   The reason why we were excluded from this life was because of our own sins.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.800]   In verse 17, "Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things so that he
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.280]   might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God."
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.460]   To make propitiation for the sins of the people.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.240]   The word propitiation, I don't know about you, but first time I heard the word propitiation
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.760]   was in seminary.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.160]   And I remember they were saying, "Oh, propitiation, propitiation."
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.800]   I remember thinking like, "Man, I should have studied in high school."
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.720]   That's the first thing I thought.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.600]   Because it's one of those SAT words, it's a theological word, basically means to have
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.640]   your sins atoned for.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:58.560]   Meaning that Christ took on our sins that you and I deserve to be punished for, and
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.000]   as a result, we were freed from the penalty of sin.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   That's what the word propitiation means.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.040]   Now the reason why Christ came, that is he lived a sinless life in order that he could
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:17.000]   take our place and absorb our sin to himself to give us new life.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.320]   The common experience of all mankind who's ever been born in this world, if you're sinned
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.600]   against, what's your natural response?
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.800]   It's like, "Turn the other cheek."
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.880]   That's when you memorize scripture.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.400]   That's where we want to try to present ourselves.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.080]   I'm talking to be honest.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.000]   If somebody slanders you, what's your natural response?
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.400]   Slander them.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.160]   If they cheat you, what do you want to do?
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.640]   You cheat them.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.880]   If they hurt you, what do you do?
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.160]   You hurt them.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.640]   So if they hit you on one cheek, your natural response is not to turn the other cheek, but
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.880]   to bring up a fist.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.040]   See that's the experience of all mankind.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.680]   The Bible says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.880]   All have sinned.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.780]   Every single one of us were born into sin.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.640]   Every one of us has sinned against somebody else, and every one of us has been sinned
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.160]   against from other people.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:22.480]   And so we're living in a world filled with people who have sinned and have been sinned
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   against.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:29.880]   So our natural response is to cheat and to slander and to covet, because that's what
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.440]   we experience.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.760]   And this is the cycle of mankind.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.240]   And every human being that comes into this perpetuate this further.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.560]   So you know, talk about, you know, get a bunch of sinful people into a room and we're going
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   to be all united.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   No.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:50.440]   A bunch of sinful people in the room sin against each other even more, because that's what
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.360]   sinful people do.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   It's not in theory.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.080]   We know that because we experience that.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:05.560]   Christ experienced everything that you and I experienced, yet did not sin.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:12.580]   He's the only one who's been sinned against who absorbed our sin upon himself.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.000]   He didn't react with the fist.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.120]   He was the only one who would have been justified.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.080]   He would have been the only one to take out vengeance, because he never sinned against
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.560]   anyone.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.640]   He would have been the only one who could have smashed us and stood before the Father
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.820]   and would have been completely justified.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:37.180]   But the only person who was justified to take vengeance came, the Scripture says, that he
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.780]   took the sin upon himself.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.980]   He absorbed it.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:50.380]   Not only does he absorb our sins, he dies and he resurrects and he gives us new life.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.460]   So that those who believe, those who have been forgiven, can no longer say, "I sinned
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.700]   because I've been sinned against."
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:02.260]   They say, "No, we love because he first loved us."
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.180]   That's what this incarnation is about.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.700]   Christ came to reverse the curse of man.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:13.460]   And only Christ and his death and resurrection has the power to do that.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:18.860]   In 1 Peter 2.24, "He himself bore our sins and in his body on the cross so that we might
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.740]   die to sin and live to righteousness.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:26.420]   For by his wounds you have been healed."
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:32.580]   So Christmas is about him delivering us from this bondage of sin.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.960]   He's the only one.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:42.040]   He's the only one who lived a perfect life, who was without defect, who is capable and
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:48.500]   who is willing to absorb our sins and to give us new life.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:54.140]   Isaiah 53.46, "Surely our griefs he himself bore and our sorrows he carried, yet we ourselves
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:59.140]   esteemed him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted, but he was pierced through for
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.140]   our transgression.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.860]   He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.360]   The chastening for our well-being fell upon him.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.300]   And by his scourging we are healed.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.820]   All of us like sheep have gone astray.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.020]   Each of us turned to his own way.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.860]   But the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him."
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:20.020]   I want to conclude with application for two different applications.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:26.160]   For those of you who are here and you have never tasted the goodness of God, you've never
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.680]   asked the Lord to forgive you of your sins.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:35.540]   He said if you confess your sins, he is faithful and just to forgive you of all your unrighteousness.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:41.740]   He's willing to bear your sins, the punishment that you and I deserve upon himself and to
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.040]   give you new life.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.700]   If you've never come to the Lord and done that, I want to encourage you this morning.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.020]   You don't need to come through me.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.940]   You don't need to come through the church.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:56.020]   You only need one mediator, Christ, who understands us perfectly, understands God perfectly, and
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.900]   he's the perfect ambassador.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:05.260]   If you would just come and confess, "Lord, I've been living a life rebelling against
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.800]   you.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.460]   I'm a sinner and I need your forgiveness."
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:14.500]   I want to encourage you to take time in the time of prayer.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.780]   Just come before God.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.580]   It doesn't have to be religious and fancy words.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.300]   It just needs to be honest.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.420]   Ask God to forgive you of your sins.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.760]   Ask God to open your eyes.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:31.900]   I remember the day that when I asked the Lord to come into my life, it changed everything.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:36.940]   Everything, every bitterness, every hatred I had in my heart, just overnight it just
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:42.260]   made sense that the God of the universe is real and that he cares for me.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.460]   So I pray that this morning, that if you're here not knowing the Lord, that you would
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.340]   open your heart and ask the Lord to forgive you of your sins.
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.340]   Then come and ask us.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.100]   If you have any questions, our welcome team will be available for you.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.100]   The leaders will be around.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.700]   So if you want to come and just ask questions, we'll be here for you.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:04.660]   Secondly, I want to talk to the brothers and sisters who are in this room.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:09.780]   You know, every year we talk about the incarnation of Christ and such an encouragement and comfort
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:14.380]   to know that he understands us.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:20.940]   But I want to challenge you this morning to move beyond yourself.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.140]   Move beyond yourself.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.540]   Don't stop in your relationship with God saying, "God is great because he understands me,"
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:33.580]   and yet you have no idea who he is.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.140]   You don't make any effort to understand him.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:42.940]   What do you think he's feeling?
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:49.380]   His children who confess him once a week go back and read the rest of the week like he
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.660]   doesn't even exist.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:59.780]   We celebrate him coming to us all for the purpose to bring us to him, and yet we stop
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.180]   with the celebration of him coming.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.460]   I want to challenge you this morning.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:12.820]   As we celebrate his incarnation, him drawing near to us to draw near to him.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.000]   Think about what he's thinking.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.300]   Think about what he's feeling.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:23.580]   Think about how broken our God must have been that he would send his only begotten son and
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:29.660]   torture him that way that we may be adopted as children.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:35.460]   So I pray that this Christmas season that we will go beyond just he loves me to I love
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.820]   you.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.140]   Let's take some time as our worship team comes up.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.460]   Again, I want to encourage you to take this time, not just this morning, but this whole
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:51.100]   Christmas season to reflect upon the verses that we covered this morning and to really
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:56.260]   redeem Christmas, not just for us, but for the world.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:00.540]   You know, more and more, you know, this is a Judeo-Christian country, at least in history,
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.460]   but more and more we're becoming more and more like China where we have the form of
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.820]   Christmas but nobody knows the significance.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.900]   So as Christians, let's redeem this, that we don't just get caught up like the rest
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:17.260]   of the world, just giving gifts and then forgetting about what it is, but as a church, as a community,
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.820]   let's redeem this for his glory.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.860]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
