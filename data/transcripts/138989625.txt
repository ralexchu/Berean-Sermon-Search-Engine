[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   And as you make your way over there, I want to recap.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.140]   Two weeks ago we started the study here in Chapter 8, verses 1 through 3.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.920]   And I made mention that the church sometimes has a lot of issues.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.000]   And the particular issue at hand for the Church of Corinth, among the many, was the fact that
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.500]   they had a question.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.140]   There are foods and meat offered to idols in their culture.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.140]   It happens a lot.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.620]   What do we do with it?
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.200]   There was a group of people in the church who said, "It's nothing.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.620]   Those wood idols are nothing, represents nothing.
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.880]   We know there's only one God.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.400]   We serve the right God.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.520]   Let's eat."
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   And the others are saying, "No, it really bothers us.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.440]   It's associated with things that aren't right.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440]   I don't want to do it.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.160]   Not only do I not want to do it, I think it's wrong."
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.040]   And so they were at odds with each other.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.960]   Obviously, perhaps some of the people who were there for a long time, or perhaps some
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.440]   individual who had a relationship with Apostle Paul wrote a letter saying, "This is what's
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.720]   going on.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.240]   Can you address the issue, please?
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.640]   We really believe that it's okay to eat meat."
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.120]   And Apostle Paul, I made the case that he responded with, "Listen, it's not enough for
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.040]   you to make a decision just based on your knowledge.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.400]   It's not enough for you to just make a decision based on the facts.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.640]   You need to care for your brothers."
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.680]   And so I made the case that your knowledge cannot be in a vacuum, but it needs to end
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680]   in love.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   Right?
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.200]   There's a case where in which you need, in every case, you need to evaluate, understand
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.680]   what's going on, but understand who you're talking to.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.680]   Right?
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.960]   Big blanket statement, everything, typically doesn't help.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.460]   Now there's a case, there's a time for when there is an objective truth to be met, yes,
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.560]   we need to stand ground, we need to make sure it's right.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.600]   But then this situation was not so much clear cut, was it?
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.120]   So I made mention of the fact that I felt like Apostle Paul as a spiritual father, he
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.720]   was instructing us as his children, giving us wisdom.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.920]   This is how you decide and make choices, the right choices in this environment.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.440]   And he encouraged us and said, "Do it in love.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.120]   Do it in love."
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.640]   Let's take a look at the passage that we have today.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.680]   And I'm going to read the whole section, so verses one through 13.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.680]   Please follow along.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.400]   It says, "Now concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.520]   Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.880]   If anyone supposes he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.480]   But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.120]   Therefore, considering the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that there is
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.140]   no such thing as an idol in the world, and that there is no God but one.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.680]   For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.120]   many gods and many lords, yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.800]   all things and we exist for Him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things and we
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.680]   exist through Him.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.400]   However, not all men have this knowledge, but some, being accustomed to the idol until
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.920]   now, eat food as if it were sacrifice to an idol, and their conscience being weak as to
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   file.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.040]   But food will not commend us to God.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.180]   We are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.320]   But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.440]   weak.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.600]   For if someone sees you who have knowledge dining in an idol's temple, will not his conscience,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.780]   if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.360]   For through your knowledge, he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   died.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.960]   And so by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.920]   you sin against Christ.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.520]   Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.640]   not cause my brother to stumble.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.960]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.720]   Father God, we thank you for your truth, we thank you for your word.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.680]   God, as your scripture has instructions on not only spiritual matters of belief, but
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.480]   how we are to behave, how we are to make decisions, I pray that in every single way, we would
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.200]   desire to be faithful to you, that in sincerity of faith, Lord, we would take your directives,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.560]   your path, and to do things your way.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.480]   We thank you for your truth that's in Christ, and we pray, amen.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.640]   So again, I am really impressed by people, like I mentioned the last time, who can make
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.560]   strong decisions and they can make them fast.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.880]   There are people who are just gifted at, you ask them, what do we do?
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.120]   And they can evaluate the situation.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   Give me all the info.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.600]   Bam, this is what we need to do.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.240]   And everything seems very clear cut.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.720]   Now along with being able to make a decision, I really like it when somebody is able to
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.960]   have the right priorities.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.920]   Meaning they know what matters, okay, in making a decision.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.080]   Now I noticed that in the summer, a lot of people moved, okay?
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.120]   A lot of youth collegians moved, a lot of people, you know, moved homes and purchased
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.960]   And we moved too, my wife and I.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.520]   And it's evident that all this is happening because our brewing coupon page is like going
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   nuts, right?
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.200]   There's so much happening on that, there's so much action.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.400]   And what happens is a lot of times you have to decide, what do I keep and what do I throw
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   away, right?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   And isn't that the question?
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.880]   Like we have so much junk, but do I keep this?
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.860]   That's just a question, do I keep it?
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.160]   But when you look at the scenario, you have to use certain criteria in order to decide.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.600]   But which criteria is best?
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.560]   A guy would typically think on finances.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.900]   If it's worth it, if I can sell it on eBay, then let's keep it, you know?
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.360]   But if it's not worth it, if I sell it and all I get is a dollar, then I'm just going
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.720]   to give it to somebody and there you go, a brewing coupon page.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   I'm just kidding.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.040]   There's a lot of good stuff on the brewing coupon.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.200]   The thing about it is though, I had a hard time this past month trying to decide, man,
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.480]   we have so much stuff.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.000]   A lot of the stuff we just accumulate.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.400]   And Bia and I both like, you know, we kind of have that Korean mentality of like, dude,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.320]   if we can wash it and keep it, just keep it, you know?
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.080]   But there are other reasons why you would keep something.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.360]   Emotional attachment, right?
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.800]   Sometimes you keep things for just utility.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.240]   One day I'm going to use this, you know, three years down the line.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.460]   Now one time I'm going to use it.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.320]   And so there was actually a moment when I was holding this little bag and I was sitting
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.880]   in front of, you know, in the kitchen and whatnot.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.920]   And I just sat there thinking, keep it, not keep it.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.560]   Keep it, not keep it.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.720]   And I was just like, like, you know, killing myself trying to decide, should I not keep
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   it?
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.080]   And this stuff, do you know what it was?
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.080]   It was a zip tie.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.960]   Do you know what a zip tie is?
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.320]   It's just a piece of plastic that you use to tie together a wire, you know, or something
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.800]   to like secure together.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   You can buy like a hundred of those for like a dollar.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.560]   And I live right next to Home Depot, so I could just run over and get some more, you
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.560]   know?
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.600]   So I was like, man, should I keep it?
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.920]   And then, you know, for a lot of you guys, it's easy because you're like, just keep everything,
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.680]   you know?
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.120]   It's difficult.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.640]   How do you decide?
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.520]   Sometimes it just doesn't matter if it's a zip tie, does it?
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.720]   It just doesn't matter.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.120]   And the reason why I bring that up is because Apostle Paul, he's writing this to a church
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:18.080]   that's chock full of issues of pride, dissension, arrogance, competing with each other, licentiousness,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.960]   immorality of some of the worst kinds and perversions.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.440]   And then what do we do about food?
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.640]   Can you imagine from a leader's perspective, receiving perhaps what I presume to be quite
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.720]   a long argumentation like, let me tell you why we should be able to eat this, you know?
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.680]   There's a sense in which perhaps Apostle Paul is thinking, oh my God, I just, you know,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.520]   I just need to talk to you about what really matters here.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.000]   And the more I read this chapter in chapter eight, I realized this is a part of a bigger
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   scope.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.400]   This is a part of a bigger argument that Apostle Paul is making.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.800]   And I made the mention that chapter eight does not stand alone.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.920]   Chapter eight, its argument goes all the way to the end of chapter 10.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.480]   And today's message is entitled, Take Care.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   But I want to start off by saying there's a sense in which when you care for something,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.920]   there's a sense in which when you're trying to do anything, there's always a priority
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.080]   issue of what really matters.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.480]   What really matters.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   So today's sermon is going to be based on Apostle Paul's thought of what matters in
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.560]   his mind.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.360]   Let's take a look really quickly, chapter eight, verse eight.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.000]   And I'm going to give you the first header, okay?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The verse reads like this, "But food will not commend us to God.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.560]   We are neither the worst if we do eat it, nor the better if we do."
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   Okay?
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.720]   So if we don't eat it, we're not better or we're not worse.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.000]   If we do eat it, we're not any better or any worse.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.040]   You know what that means?
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.040]   It doesn't matter.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.040]   That's what that means.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.120]   It's like when you do it and there's nothing, then it doesn't matter.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   Okay?
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:07.720]   So heading number one is this, food does not matter, but what matters is the one true God.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.080]   If you're taking notes, please write all of that.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.960]   I know it's a long heading, but you need all those words.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.920]   Food does not matter, but what matters is the one true God.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.760]   Why do I say this?
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.800]   It's because in verse four through six, he makes a theological affirmation, meaning he's
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.200]   responding to the letter of the Corinthian church and he is affirming something, but
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.400]   that theological truth is so emphatic, we have to pay attention.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Let's take a look.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.560]   Verse four, it says this, "Therefore, concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols,
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.560]   we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world and that there is no God
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.420]   but one."
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.380]   What is the theological truth?
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.380]   It is monotheistic.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.480]   There is one God.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.800]   How does that argument fit?
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.960]   If there is one God, all these thousands of other gods, these idols, the wooden figures,
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.660]   the temples, you know what?
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.200]   You could have millions if you want.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.000]   None of it is real because we believe there's only one.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.520]   And then he continues, "For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.560]   earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords, according to their culture and custom,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.840]   there is so many.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:25.640]   Yet for us there is but one God, the Father from whom all things, and we exist for him,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:32.160]   and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things, and we exist through him."
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.920]   Now what I'd like to do is, if you're taking notes, you have to take notes here, okay?
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:44.640]   Because this is almost like a side note, but it's so pivotal to the rest of the sermon,
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.760]   okay?
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.240]   Write a couple statements.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.560]   You know how the doctrine of the Trinity has various statements?
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.600]   We believe one true God, there's three persons, each person is fully God.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   It's not like they're one third God, one third God, one third God, and you piece them together,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.240]   and the pie makes the whole, you know, each piece of the pie makes the whole pizza, you
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   know?
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.300]   It's not like that.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   So you have these three statements.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.600]   Well, what's really interesting about here is he starts off by saying this, "There's
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.360]   one God," right?
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.000]   End of verse four, "There is no God but one."
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.960]   That's statement number one.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.080]   Statement number two, notice what he says here about God the Father.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.160]   He says in verse six, "But there is one God, the Father."
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.080]   So number two looks like this, "One God equals Father."
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.600]   Okay?
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.320]   Statement number three looks like this.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.080]   He says, "And one Lord, Jesus Christ," right?
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.320]   "One Lord equals Jesus Christ."
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:48.560]   Now you might be thinking, "Huh, okay, I see what you're going at.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.440]   Jesus Christ is God."
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.560]   Well, I want you to think about that in context with what's happening.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.000]   If you go in your Bibles to Deuteronomy chapter six, verse four, this sentence structure in
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.760]   many ways has affinity and similarity to what Moses says in Deuteronomy chapter six, verse
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   four.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.680]   I'm not going to read verses one through five, but go to Deuteronomy.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.200]   And as you go there, I want to remind you that Deuteronomy is such a pivotal book in
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   the Bible.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   It is the second law, meaning it's the review of the law.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.040]   Moses is telling the people, "This is what God wants of you.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.160]   This is what you needed to do in your life before the Lord, in the presence of God."
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.380]   Verse one, chapter six, verse one, "Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:39.080]   which the Lord your God has commanded me to teach you, that you might do them in the land
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.720]   where you are going over to possess, so that you and your son and your grandson might fear
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.400]   the Lord your God to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.960]   all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:58.160]   O Israel, you should listen and be careful to do it, that it may be well with you and
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.120]   that you may multiply greatly, just as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has promised
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.680]   you in a land flowing with milk and honey."
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   Listen to this.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.440]   "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.720]   You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.360]   your might."
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.720]   This is called the great Shema.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.960]   It's called the Shema because in Hebrew, that line in verse four, "Hear, O Israel," is an
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.040]   emphatic statement.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.940]   In the Hebrew, it sounds like, "Shema Yisrael."
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.880]   And that is the tag that the Israelites used in all of their services and all their, you
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.040]   know, synagogue meetings and prayer meetings and worship and sacrifices.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.240]   As a matter of fact, in the culture, the Jewish people prayed twice in the morning and in
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.680]   the evening, and do you know what they opened with?
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   That line.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.080]   A monotheistic, "We believe in one God."
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   Why?
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.280]   Contrary to the pagan nations of the day, contrary to the rest of the world, where they
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   worship everything from the moon, the sun, the ground, the cows, and the animals, we
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.040]   worship the one true God.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.560]   We are the people of the one true God.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.840]   That's the first thing they said and the last thing they said.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.080]   They prayed that twice every single day.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:20.280]   If you go over just in your Bibles, just to Deuteronomy chapter 10, and if you, I'm gonna
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.120]   read to us verses 12 through 17.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.560]   It says, "Now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require from you but to fear the
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.840]   Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.000]   all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep the Lord's commandments and His statutes,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.920]   which I am commanding you today for your good?
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.240]   Behold, to the Lord your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   that is in it.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.840]   Yet on your fathers did the Lord set His affection to love them, and He chose or descended after
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.480]   them even you above all peoples, as it is this day.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.040]   So circumcise your heart and stiffen your neck no longer.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.800]   For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.920]   the awesome God who does not take a bribe."
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.640]   What I'm wanting to emphasize is this.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.160]   Who is the Lord?
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.760]   He is the Lord, their God.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.440]   He is the Lord, our God.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.400]   And if you would go back to 1 Corinthians chapter 8, look at the sentence structure
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   of what he's saying.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.720]   He's saying such a profound statement.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.920]   I never realized that this passage in 1 Corinthians chapter 8, talking about food, Apostle Paul
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   would put in a theological statement that's perhaps one of the most explicit statements
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.960]   that proves the deity of Christ.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.320]   Right?
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:47.240]   He says, "There is one God, God the Father, and it describes Him, the one from whom are
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.520]   all things and we are for Him.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.200]   And then there's one Lord."
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   Who is the Lord?
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   The Lord, our God.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   He's God.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:01.840]   So this is like a Christological monotheistic statement.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.560]   It's Christ, it's God, but they're one.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.480]   Profound truth of the Bible.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   Right?
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.800]   Now, there is this big, "So what?"
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   Why would he put this here?
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.360]   Is he just saying, "Yeah, yeah, people, I understand what you're saying.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   You're saying there's one God.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.040]   There's no other God, so voila."
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   You know?
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.240]   I think Apostle Paul is emphasizing this thing, "You know, I see an issue.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.160]   I see an issue with the way you guys are thinking.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.440]   Because you are telling me in your argumentation, 'Hey, we can eat because there's one God.'
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.280]   But for you, the emphasis is, the application of this theology that God is one is, 'So
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.400]   now we can eat?'
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.120]   So what's your major concern?
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   Now we can eat."
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.560]   Apostle Paul is saying, "Really?
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.560]   That's what matters to you?
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.520]   Now we can eat?"
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.840]   Beautiful theology, connecting Old Testament truth of how God is the Lord, he is the Lord
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.160]   God, God of gods, the Lord your God who brought you out.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.360]   He's connected with Christ, our Lord, our Savior.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:15.520]   And the oneness that exists in them now has application to, "And now we can eat?"
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.560]   I wonder if Apostle Paul is frustrated.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.880]   I bet he was frustrated.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.240]   The application is missing something great.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:30.760]   Because in their making much of the eating and the food, they neglect the weightier issue.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:37.000]   The weightier issue is that people are debating idolatry.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.440]   Right?
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.160]   The weightier issue isn't, "Oh, it's just, can we eat and eat or not?"
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.280]   Like, "It's better to be a vegan, actually."
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.800]   There's a passage in the Bible that says, "If you're vegan, you are weak."
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   All right.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.200]   There's a passage in the book of Romans that talks about this whole idea.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.480]   There are those individuals who are struggling, just like in the church of Corinth, in the
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.520]   church of Rome, they're struggling with the same idea.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.200]   Remember that I told you last time that this is not just an isolated event.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.840]   For us, we might be thinking, "This is not even a big issue to us."
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.160]   For us, we might be thinking, "Yeah, I think I know that one guy who used to go to this
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.360]   one cult and he considers stuff like days, one day better than another day.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   You know, it has to be this day or that day.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.680]   He considers certain foods unclean."
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.800]   And you might be thinking, "This is a pretty isolated event."
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.880]   Remember, this is not an isolated event.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.080]   Just about every single person deals with this issue.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.080]   The only issue is time.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.520]   There are people who recently converted and they're very accustomed to that culture of
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520]   idolatry.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.400]   Remember, everybody worshiped a god.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.640]   There weren't really atheists who said there was absolutely no god.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.480]   Even if they didn't believe in one particular god, they just still were agnostic and said,
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.360]   "I worship and offer sacrifices to some god."
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.200]   Remember I said that in social environments, in workplace environments, they would run
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.920]   into this all the time.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.560]   Wedding ceremonies, graduation ceremonies, any big event, any big commemoration of anything,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:08.800]   maybe an academic achievement, would have been involved, perhaps, thanks to a god.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.760]   And there would be food.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   What do you do?
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.760]   Right?
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:21.360]   Apostle Paul is almost saying, "If you cared for truly the theology of the one true god,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.960]   wouldn't you be careful about idolatry?"
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.880]   But now you're more concerned about the food.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.480]   If you really cared about the one true god who has this oneness between god the father
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.920]   and the son, wouldn't you care about the unity?
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.200]   You're missing a huge point here.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.000]   You care too much about the food and not so much about being careful.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Because there is that question.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.840]   I mean, if you believe in a god almighty, if you believe, just like the Jews did, in
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:57.160]   this one true lord, the god of gods, elevated amongst all any deities that people would
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:05.360]   lift it up, and he is the lord of lords, how careful should you be about offending that
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.520]   god?
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.960]   Write that in there.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.760]   How careful should you be?
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.360]   Because that's going to be a theme of what I'm going to be talking about today.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.480]   How careful should you be?
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.600]   Not just insignificant matters, like I mentioned earlier.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.000]   I can be super duper careful.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Should I throw this away?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Should I not?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.200]   But if it's a zip tie, it's one thing.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.280]   If it's a family heirloom album, it's another.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.760]   But the thing about it is, the way you care for one and the other should be very different.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.480]   So Paul is getting at that idea.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.680]   You guys are still writing to me about food.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.000]   There are weightier matters at stake.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.760]   What is the weightier matter?
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.200]   We're going to number two now.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:50.920]   So number one was, food does not matter, but what matters is the one true god.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:59.040]   His next train of thought is number two, there exists a threat of objective idolatry and
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.680]   subjective idolatry.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:08.520]   So number two is, there exists a threat of objective idolatry and subjective idolatry.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.920]   What do I mean by that?
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:18.240]   Well there is obviously objective idolatry in the sense that, okay, if you imagine objective
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:25.400]   idolatry, to be objective is there is a standard that is independent of personal feelings,
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   who you are.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.840]   There's just this independent standard that applies to all.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.640]   So you're talking something objective.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.760]   So yeah, if you say, "I offer this to you, Molech."
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.720]   No matter what you say, you could swear like, "I didn't mean it, I didn't mean to do it."
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.560]   You can say whatever you want, but objectively you worship the idol, right?
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.680]   But what are we talking about in terms of this case?
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:53.360]   We're not talking about clear cut, biblically wrong, standard of God, you offended the Lord,
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.200]   you transgressed, that kind of stuff here, are we?
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.560]   We're really talking about subjective idolatry, meaning perhaps in the eyes of others, perhaps
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.760]   in the perspective of the community, they don't see it necessarily something wrong.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:13.800]   But if in your own mind, you associate that with something wrong, if your own conscience
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.520]   something tells you, "I shouldn't do this."
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.040]   But then you decide, "I'm going to do it anyway."
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.680]   What is that?
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.000]   Subjective idolatry, that's what he says.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.360]   So if you go back, he says in verse seven, "However, not all men have this knowledge,
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.880]   but some being accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were a sacrifice to
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.720]   an idol, and their conscience being weak is defiled."
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:46.400]   So I asked earlier, I made mention of this, that the weak individual in this passage,
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.440]   he's not the person who is lacking knowledge.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.920]   He's not the person who just doesn't happen to know.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.720]   To tell you honestly, sometimes that's how I feel.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   I feel weak in my mind because I don't know what to do.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.440]   Someone asked me a question about counseling, it's like, "Duh, I'll have to get back
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   to you."
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   I feel weak.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.920]   If my wife asks me, "What should we do about this?
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.640]   Some family issue, parenting issue, how to discipline our kids, and I don't know what
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.240]   to do because I just don't have experience."
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.740]   Yes, I feel weak, but that's not the kind of weakness that this particular passage is
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.440]   talking about.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.200]   Although that is a kind of weakness referenced in Romans chapter 14, that's not the kind
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.400]   of weakness this is talking about.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.920]   This is talking about the weakness when you know what is right and wrong, but your heart
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.040]   is weak to say no.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.840]   And can I ask you, have you personally ever been in that situation?
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.320]   I know I have.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.320]   I know I have.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.880]   And I'm sure you have too.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.160]   Because every single one of us wrestles with issues.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.640]   These people have social issues.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:57.600]   "Pastor Paul, if I say no to this food, then they're going to reject me.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.200]   If I say no to this food, I might potentially actually offend a higher official.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   Typically the people who are putting out food, they're not just poor people, they're probably
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   powerful people.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.560]   And if I reject the food, then what's going to happen to me?"
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.360]   There are social pressures, aren't there?
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.440]   We experience social pressures.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.720]   I want approval.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.000]   I want people to like me.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.200]   I want the people who are above me to think I'm doing a good job.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   And in that is always what?
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.720]   A temptation to do something against my conscience.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.200]   To do something that's not clear.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.920]   Can I give a challenge now?
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:38.800]   You know before, two weeks ago, I made the exhortation that sometimes you need to make
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.560]   a decision based on love.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.880]   You know certain things, you have knowledge of certain things, you know what's wise, and
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.920]   you feel like you should do something and something seems really practical.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.000]   But against that practicality is the condition of love, right?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.640]   But here and now, let me say this.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.600]   Sometimes you need to make a decision simply on the fact that you have to, you have to
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.520]   keep a clear conscience.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   You cannot default.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.920]   Do you notice the words that he used in this passage to talk about the guilty conscience?
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.520]   The conscience that goes against what he knows to be right?
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.120]   He talks about it as the conscience being defiled.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.400]   He talks about the weak person being ruined.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.760]   He talks about the weak person being destroyed.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.880]   In other passages, again I keep referencing Romans chapter 14, we're going to read over
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.920]   that a little bit later.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.640]   He talks about the individual literally being destroyed as in pummeled.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:36.240]   Because when you feel like something is right, but because of other people, because of your
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   desires, because of your cravings, whatever the issue is, and you start thinking like
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.320]   maybe it's okay.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.160]   Do you know what you do to your conscience?
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.120]   You pummel it.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.520]   You beat it up.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.200]   You destroy it.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   And let me give a warning.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.480]   If you guys have felt this, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.360]   If your conscience is not clear, your life is in ruin.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.920]   Your life is utterly in ruin.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.600]   If you go against your conscience, you're rebelling against the probing and the prodding
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.200]   of the Holy Spirit, the conviction of God in us.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.600]   There's no way you're going to be okay.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.360]   And whatever you think of your life, how you interpret your life, how you interpret the
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.320]   world around you, that's going to be skewed.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.360]   If you go against your conscience, there's going to be guilt.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.960]   If you go against your conscience, there's going to be uneasiness.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.920]   And now you interpret everything like, "Oh my gosh, is God rebuking me?
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.200]   Is God, you know, punishing me?"
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.580]   If you do not have a clear conscience, you have no confidence.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:40.400]   How can you raise your hands and say, "And I lift my holy hands."
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.440]   You can't.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.520]   How can you say boldly, "Hey brother, you know what?
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.880]   I think you ought to."
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.320]   Because you know exactly what they're going to say.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   "Oh, pfft.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.880]   You're the one to talk about you should."
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.760]   You can't talk about you should because you ruined and defiled your conscience.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.160]   If you ignore your conscience, you defile it.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:06.980]   What you do when you go against your faith is you're ruining your conscience.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:14.420]   So notice, Apostle Paul currently is not endeavoring to simply teach the weak and say, "Hey, hey,
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.120]   hey, hey, hey.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.160]   Stop rocking the boat.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160]   Meat is good.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.160]   Meat's yummy.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.440]   You can eat it, okay?
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440]   God is one.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.640]   Let me show you this amazing theology of a Christological monotheism that Christ is God,
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.460]   he is Lord, and through him everything was created.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.460]   Just say thank you.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.460]   Yum, yum, yum."
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.080]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.480]   He's encouraging the weak, "Don't you dare go against your conscience."
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   Right?
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.840]   "Don't you dare go against your conviction."
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.520]   Turn in your Bibles to Romans chapter 14.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.000]   In Romans chapter 14, same problems.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.560]   And I'm going to emphasize certain things here.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.280]   I'm going to read verses 1 through 5, and then I'm going to start reading from verse
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   22.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   Verses 1 through 5 reads like this.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   Okay?
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.200]   I'm going to give you a moment to get there.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.080]   He says, "Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.120]   judgment on his opinions."
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.280]   So not speaking to the weak people, but speaking to the people who are thinking they're strong.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.160]   He says, "Don't pass judgment on these people."
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.200]   He says, "One person has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   only.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:32.960]   The one who eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.680]   does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.480]   Who are you to judge the servant of another?
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.200]   To his own master he stands or falls, and he will stand for the Lord is able to make
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.400]   him stand.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.040]   One person regards one day above another, another regards every day alike.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.720]   Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind."
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.640]   Do you see that?
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.240]   You need to be convinced in your own mind.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.160]   So earlier I asked you this question.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:12.120]   If we have a theology, if we have a theology that God is the one true God, then we need
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.740]   to be really careful, right?
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.640]   We need to be really, really careful.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.240]   But here in line also, if there is a threat of idolatry, you need to be really, really
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   careful.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   Are you sure?
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.160]   And if you're not convinced, then can you move on it?
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   It's better and safer not to.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   Remember the words of Martin Luther.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.720]   He said very clearly, he said, you know, "I cannot recant of anything.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.980]   I will not go against my conscience," because he says, "It's neither safe nor right."
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.640]   It's neither safe nor right to go against my conscience.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.440]   It's not right because in God's eyes, as he sees that, he's looking at not so much the
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.760]   food because the food is not the matter.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:00.200]   He's looking at your willingness to rebel against your own faith and say, "I'm going
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   to do it anyway."
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:09.400]   I wondered, you know, how many of us sometimes do that?
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.440]   Sometimes if I can openly confess a little bit, there are times when I know like something
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.400]   I shouldn't do and it's maybe something minor, something small, but have you ever done this?
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.240]   Like you know that certain people are going to be bothered.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.280]   If you have some people in your life who are clear cut, straight shooters, they're the
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.960]   rule meisters, they'll always tell you how it is and I love having those people in my
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.720]   life because it always keeps me straight, you know?
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.120]   But if you have those people in your life, there's a temptation.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:39.720]   I know it's going to bother him, so I'm just going to keep it to myself and do it on my
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   own.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.600]   Have you guys ever done that?
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.000]   I know it's going to bother her, so I just keep it low on the down low.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   That's why I didn't say anything.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.760]   That's why I didn't.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.680]   I mean, is that the right response?
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.920]   Is that being careful?
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:01.160]   If there is a threat of subjective sin, subjective idolatry because you want to do something,
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.040]   but you know that certain things won't be approved, so what do you do?
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   You have to what?
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   Beat up your conscience.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   You have to beat up your thought.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.640]   You have to beat up your faith in order to do what you want.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.640]   What is that but idolatry?
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.480]   Apostle Paul is saying there's a bigger issue than just food.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.360]   A bigger issue than just food.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.920]   So Apostle Paul gives this, I think really indirectly, gives this exhortation to those
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.140]   who can relate to the weak.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.300]   It is not just an issue of lack of knowledge.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.160]   It is not just an issue of I don't know.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.220]   It's an issue of a lack of willpower.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.560]   It's an issue of a lack of strength, and truly I believe that is where strong decisions are
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.560]   made.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.920]   I hope that as a young guy for me that I grow in that.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.080]   Apostle Paul says by the exercise of truth, by the practice of righteousness, we mature.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.800]   And I get that because when you make strong decisions, when you make decisions that you
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.880]   know to be right in your conscience, then you have a greater confidence to walk and
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.240]   be bold in that righteousness in the future.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.640]   But I pray that I grow in that, and I pray that for you.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.120]   Keep your conscience absolutely pure.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:20.280]   Do not ever compromise the thought in your mind, God might not be pleased by this.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:26.000]   Now, moving to number three then, Apostle Paul gives the exhortation in 1 Corinthians
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.880]   chapter 8.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:39.420]   He says in 1 Corinthians chapter 8, starting from verse 9, "But take care that this liberty
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.400]   of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:49.040]   If someone sees you who has knowledge, dining in idols' temples, will not his conscience,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.160]   if he is weak, be strained for him to eat things sacrificed to idols?"
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.960]   In other passages it says, "Wouldn't he be emboldened?"
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.480]   I mean in the ESV translation.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.600]   "For through your knowledge, he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   died.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.000]   And so by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.360]   you sin against Christ.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.840]   Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again."
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.040]   He said, "I will not cause my brother to stumble."
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:24.160]   I know that in our generation, we don't like having such huge expectations on us.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:33.200]   It's like, dang, for the Bible to call on us to go and care for the brother to the extent
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.120]   that we would never eat meat?
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.920]   I mean, at least be willing to do that.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.800]   He's not calling everybody to give up meat, but he's saying at least be willing to do
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   that.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.040]   He said, "I would.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.040]   I would give that up.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.520]   If it causes my brother to stumble, I would give up meat."
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.140]   Think about the degree of care.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.880]   Think about the degree of caution.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.880]   Think about the degree of burden.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.320]   Did you ever think about that a little bit?
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.920]   Or I may have you think about that a little bit.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.840]   Do you perhaps think like, "Whoa, that's kind of crazy.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.400]   I mean, if you take that, if you play the devil's advocate, it's like, then I can't
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.560]   do anything.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.480]   Because hypothetically, someone might see you, so I can't ever."
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.080]   Whatever it is, fill in the blank there.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:19.560]   Purposely, I didn't talk about drinking, going to clubs and lounges, tattoos on your body.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   I didn't talk about that stuff, because why?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.040]   Romans taught us you need to be convinced in your own mind.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:29.680]   And all these passages about making your decisions wisely about your love, about your knowledge,
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.720]   about your clarity of conscience, you apply those things.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.080]   But fill in the blank there.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.720]   Someone could play the devil's advocate and be like, "So I guess I can't do anything.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.360]   Because if that guy is hurting, if that guy says, 'Oh, that bothers me,' then I just
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.000]   can't do it, huh?"
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.840]   It is a big burden, isn't it?
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.920]   To care for the church and the people around you, to care about your image.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.200]   I mean, do I not have to care about my image?
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   I don't like that.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.040]   And I could hear somebody saying, "That's not peace.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   That's oppressive.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   I don't want to live like that."
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:06.080]   Well, brothers and sisters, if we don't care, what you are is reckless.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.000]   If you don't carry that burden, what you are is careless.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.880]   I mean, think about this for a moment, okay?
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.080]   I have kids, and a lot of times people want to play with my kids.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.720]   And my second one, Emmett, he's really light, so people like to throw him around a little
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   bit.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   Throw him up in the air.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.200]   And I remember we just went to a birthday party, and someone threw him up, and his head
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.040]   came this close to a water pipe.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.040]   It was like, "Ooooop!"
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.040]   I was like, "Eeeew!"
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   It was like, "Stop it!"
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:38.000]   And the thing about it is, if I'm carrying something precious, you know, some of you
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.680]   guys have, again, precious art pieces you made at home.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.560]   If someone's carrying that, it's okay for you to be like, "Can you be careful with that?"
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.040]   If someone's caring for your baby, and they're holding them, you have to be careful.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.780]   And if the parent says, "Can you be careful with that?"
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:58.220]   If you're driving someone's car, and you're not careful, the driver or the owner of the
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.080]   car has the right to be like, "Can you please be careful?"
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.300]   Okay, be careful.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:09.180]   And the thing about it is, you can't sit there and be like, "Ugh, you're so mean.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.180]   So oppressive.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.820]   You gotta let me be free."
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.820]   No.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.460]   Whenever you're, the fact of the matter is, whenever you hold anything precious, you have
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.460]   to be careful.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:24.540]   And Apostle Paul, you potentially can place a stumbling block before the precious children
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.180]   for whom Christ died.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.180]   There is nothing more precious that is worth the blood of Christ.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.860]   And repeat that again.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.300]   You think about the value of something.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.980]   There is nothing as precious as the blood of Christ spilled for us.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:45.940]   That means you, yes you, are precious in the sight of God, and Apostle Paul believes that.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.420]   So he's exhorting us, the church, "Can you please be careful?
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.300]   You're arguing with me about eating food.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:58.380]   Can I ask you just to be careful with these children whom Christ died for?"
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.940]   He is a father at heart.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.420]   He said, "Can you please be careful with these?"
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.860]   And if that's a stumbling block to them, guess what for me?
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:11.660]   I'd rather die than be a stumbling block for my kids.
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.740]   I won't eat meat.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.120]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.100]   You see what he's saying?
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.540]   So if you go over in Romans, he says the same things.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.500]   I'm gonna start reading from verse 13 down to the end.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.500]   Okay?
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:31.420]   He says, "Therefore, let us not judge one another any more, but rather determine this,
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:37.900]   not to put a stumbling block, or an obstacle, or a stumbling block in a brother's way."
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.340]   He's like frustrated.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.940]   I want you guys to love each other.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.240]   I want you guys to have an application of the truth that God is one, that you guys will
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   be one.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.600]   But you're not even being one.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.440]   You guys are fighting each other and fighting each other over food.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   Stop judging each other.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.840]   And then he goes on, verse 14, "I know that I am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:02.600]   is unclean and of itself, but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean."
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.200]   You must be convinced in your own mind.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.800]   "For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love,
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.760]   do not destroy with your food him whom Christ died."
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.960]   That's the emphatic point.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   Be careful.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.800]   Verse 16, "Therefore, do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.280]   For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.600]   Holy Spirit.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.760]   For he who is this way serves Christ as acceptable to God and approved by men.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:39.160]   So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.800]   Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:47.080]   All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.280]   It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or do anything by which your brother stumbles.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.240]   The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.640]   Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.520]   But he who doubts is condemned if he eats because his eating is not from faith and whatever
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.280]   is not from faith is sin."
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.040]   Now I want to wrap up by saying this.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:17.280]   I started the sermon by saying whatever the controversial issues in our day, Apostle Paul
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.820]   gives certain clear grounds and wisdom principles to decide what to do about it.
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.040]   He talks about what's profitable, what's not profitable.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.560]   He talks about what's controlling, what's not controlling.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.400]   He talks about what's going to give us clarity of conscience, what's not going to give us
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.400]   clarity of conscience.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.320]   He talks about what's going to be really loving and what's going to not be loving.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.520]   He's giving so many different criteria about how we ought to decide.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.440]   And I can almost hear just some of the people still complaining.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.200]   It's like, "Gosh, but it's hard.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.960]   If we don't eat this food, then seriously, we're going to get rejected.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.040]   It might be really hard for me to advance so it's related to my job.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.160]   It might give excuses like, "You know, if we don't eat, then we can't reach out to these
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.160]   people.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.520]   We can't socialize with them.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.040]   So it's better not to offend them so that we can reach out."
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.920]   Not only that, but this is everywhere.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.440]   There's all these excuses.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.440]   This is everywhere.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   It's everywhere around us.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.280]   It's this cultural norm.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.280]   How do you avoid it?
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.280]   You can't.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   We just should eat it.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   Plus, theologically, it was permissible.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   But remember what I said.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.360]   Those are all reasons.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.440]   I'm glad you thought of them.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.920]   But Apostle Paul is pushing for something greater.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:41.280]   And he's asking, "Are you in this debate arguing with me about food?"
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.840]   But the other question is, "Are you pursuing something greater?"
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.520]   Earlier, Apostle Paul in Romans chapter, when I read to you that passage in chapter 14,
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:55.080]   he says in verse 19, "So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   up of one another."
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.320]   Are you pursuing that?
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.280]   And if you go in 1 Corinthians chapter 10, he talks about the food offered to idols.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.480]   And he essentially is going to say, "Listen to me.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.320]   I said earlier, the food is nothing.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.320]   And I believe it.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   The food is nothing.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   But guess what?
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.320]   Don't eat it."
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   That's what he says.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.320]   Why?
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:18.080]   Because in verse 23, he says, "All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.000]   All things are lawful, but not all things edify.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.880]   Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.480]   Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking question for conscience sake.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.680]   For the earth is the Lord's and all that's in it."
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.920]   I'm on chapter 10, verse 27.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.360]   It says, "If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.240]   is set before you without asking questions for conscience sake."
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.040]   I'm going to jump down to verse 31.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.960]   "Whether then you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.560]   Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.160]   Just as I also please all men and all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:01.040]   of many so that they may be saved."
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.880]   Don't argue with me just about what's permissible because then you're not really pursuing the
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.600]   greater things that matter.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.800]   All you're doing is holding a zip tie and saying, "Should I or should I not?
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   Should I or should I not?"
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:19.360]   Throw it away and give attention to the things that matter, to the things that's going to
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.400]   edify, the things that's going to glorify.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.800]   Consider the one true God.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:30.360]   Consider Him to whom you might potentially commit subjective idolatry.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.080]   He's summarizing the great law.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.880]   Love God and love your neighbor.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:42.280]   Consider your neighbor so important that you would sacrifice, that you would consider what
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.060]   you would give up, that you would be so careful.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.500]   We know that things go viral.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.460]   We know that things pervade.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.720]   We know that things move so fast.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.600]   So let's be careful.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.720]   Let's be careful with the church that God's given us and primarily the gospel that you
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:06.360]   contain, that you possess, gives you now an obligation to guard against anything, anything
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.000]   that will put a stumbling block before the redemption cause of God.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.840]   Let's make sure that we are sober and walking in a way where we place no thorn in the buck,
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.680]   but rather it's very clear we are pursuing the greater matters.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   Let's pray.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:34.200]   God, we want to first thank you again so much God.
