[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Good morning, church family.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   We will now begin our service.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   All right, sorry, we'll try that one more time.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Sing wonderful, merciful.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Wonderful, merciful Savior.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Precious Redeemer and friend.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Who would have thought that a lamb could rescue the souls of men?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Oh, you rescue the souls of men.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Counselor, comfort her.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Counselor, comfort her, King.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Spirit, we long to embrace.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   You offer hope when our hearts hopelessly lost the way.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Oh, we hopelessly lost the way.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   You are the one that we praise.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You are the one we adore.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   You give the healing and grace.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Our hearts always hunger.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Oh, our hearts always hunger.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Almighty, infinite Father.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Faithfully loving your own.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Here in our weakness you find us.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Falling before your throne.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Oh, we're falling before your throne.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   You are the one that we praise.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   You are the one we adore.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   You give the healing and grace.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Our hearts always hunger.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Oh, our hearts always hunger.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You are the one that we praise.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   You are the one we adore.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   You give the healing and grace.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Our hearts always hunger.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Oh, our hearts always hunger.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Oh, our hearts always hunger.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   - All right, good morning.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Welcome to Bruin Community Church.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Let me get a few announcements started.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   First of all, happy Father's Day.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I think some of you guys are here because it's Father's Day.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Our children and the moms have prepared some snacks for you,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and they wanted me to tell you the variety that you have
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   is beef jerky, chocolate, homemade cookies, chips, candy.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   So basically, it's going to be out there at the table.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And they said that you can get whatever you want,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   but you can only grab three.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Okay, so don't grab more than three, they said.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And then the drinks, you have non-dairy milk tea
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   is one of the drinks that you can grab.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Or if you're health conscious, there's jasmine tea.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So after the service, just go visit one of the tables,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   and they'll have those stuff ready for you.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Just make sure you can grab that bag and take it with you.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So again, happy Father's Day.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Newcomer's Welcome Lunch is happening on June 30th.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So if you are new to the church and you want to find out
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   what the church is about or meet some of the people
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   who are serving at our church, that's happening on June 30th
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   at 1 p.m. in the Youth Group Chapel.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So across the courtyard, entrance into that at 1 p.m.,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   there's going to be lunch provided and basically
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   a light presentation about what's going on at church.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Two other things.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Gospel Presentation Q&A Night on Heaven and Hell
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   is being held on Wednesday on July 10th at 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   So it's going to be led by our outreach team.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Pastor Mark Lim is going to be hosting that.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And the Q&A is going to happen, and the people who are going to be
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   on the panel is Dr. Mobley from UC Irvine.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He's a member of our church.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He's going to be here, and then Elder James Hong
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   is also going to be there to answer any kind of questions that you have on that.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   So our outreach team is hosting that on that one night on July 10th.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And then there's going to be a Seeker Group,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   meaning people who are interested in the gospel and have a lot of questions,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   there's going to be a small group that's going to be taking place
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   July 24th to August 14th from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   So it's on Wednesday nights, I think two or three Wednesdays.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   So if you have a friend or family who may benefit from having this,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   you can contact them, and they'll give you the information for that.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   So it's being led by our outreach team.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Pastor Mark is going to be hosting that.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   One other thing is the retreat.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   They said our capacity is almost filled.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   The hotel has given us a number that we can't go beyond.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   So early registration, obviously, was finished.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   But if you are planning to go, please sign up for that,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and we have room for a little bit more.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And so that's happening in August.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And then one last thing, as you guys know,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   our Korea team is headed out to Korea for some of our missions tonight.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   We'll be leaving tonight, and we'll be coming back on July 3rd.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And so our team, after our worship time, is going to come up and give a presentation.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So you can know who they are, see their faces,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   and they're going to be doing a body worship presentation.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And we want you guys to take some time to pray for them as we go.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So that's what's happening today.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I'm going to pray for us for our offering.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   If you have a physical offering, we have an offering box in the back
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   that you can visit on the way out.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And then after our worship time, our brother Angelo is going to come,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   give his testimony, and be baptized.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Father, we thank you for all that you are doing and continue to do in our lives.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   We pray, Father God, that you would help us to keep our mind and heart
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   fully engaged in you, that our worship will be a pleasing sacrifice.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   We pray that our giving may be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   May this busy weekend be filled with your grace and reminders, Lord God,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   of your love toward us.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Bless this time and bless this worship, Lord God, for the sake of your name.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   [music]
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   [music]
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   [music]
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   [music]
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Let us all rise and let us spend a few moments to greet the neighbors
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   around us before we continue.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   [music]
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Our next song is "Here is Love," and this morning we'll be singing it
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   slightly differently where we will just be singing through the five verses
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   of the hymn.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And so I hope and pray that we may be encouraged as we sing through
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   the gospel through these lyrics.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   [music]

[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   [silence]
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   >> All right, so that's our CREA mission team.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   They're going to be headed out.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   We're going to be headed out tonight, and then we'll be back on July 3rd.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And I'm going to be swinging by to India on the way back,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   and I'll be back a few days after them.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   But we're working with two churches that are out in CREA.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   We're going to be running English camps, and then hopefully through that,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   we'll be able to share the gospel and strengthen the church that is there.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   If you can just, again, continue to keep us in your prayer.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Matthew 28, verse 16 to 20.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Matthew 28, 16 to 20.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   "But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   to the mountain which Jesus had designated.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some were doubtful.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   'All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   teaching them to observe all that I commanded you,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.'"
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Let's pray.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Father, we thank you for today.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   We thank you for all the things that you are doing behind the scene.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   We pray that you would bless the time that we have,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   help us to understand your word,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   and that our hearts and our lives will be surrendered to you.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Again, today, as I was preparing for the sermon, I had to kind of wrestle with,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   am I going to preach on the Father's Day today,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   or this is graduation weekend, so we have a lot of friends who are in town
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   because of their children's graduation.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And it's also our send-off service because our Korea team is going out to missions,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   and so I was kind of wrestling with what should I focus on,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   and so my conclusion was I'm going to focus on all of it.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   So at the end, hopefully I can wrap this up,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   and I believe that the Great Commission has application for the fathers,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   the graduates, and the people who are going out as well.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   If you think of leadership, there is a clear contrast that the Bible teaches us
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   between King Saul and King David.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Saul was established because Israel wanted a king just like the other nations,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   and they were going through all these cycles of problems,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   and they concluded falsely that maybe the reason why they were having this problem
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   is because they don't have a king.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   So they banded a king, and they established this king, King Saul,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   and then eventually he ends up getting rejected
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   because of certain actions that he was taking.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And so the contrast that is made between why Saul is rejected
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   and why David is established is written in 1 Samuel 16:7.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   It says, "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look at his appearance
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   For God sees not as man sees, but man looks at the outward appearance,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   but the Lord looks at the heart.'"
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   So the only difference that is made,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   at least it spells out for us, between why Saul is rejected and why David is received
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   is Saul was a man who was after his own heart.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   He used that opportunity, his authority, his power, his money
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   to gain advantage for himself.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   So every opportunity he got, he used his position to advance himself.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And then he says of David, the reason why David was selected
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   was a man after God's own heart.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And so that was a distinction between a good leader and a bad leader,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   a man after God's own heart.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And the reason why this is so important, if you do not know the heart of God,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   you won't understand why you need to pray.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   If you do not understand the heart of God,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   you study the Bible just because you're supposed to, you're a Christian.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   If you don't understand the heart of God, why God is so concerned about the laws.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   As today is Father's Day, one of the benefits of having older children now
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   is they have some money.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   So they actually are able to buy gifts.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Before it was just, I owe you, I'll give you a massage.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And so those are usually the gifts, or they have a paper necktie that they would make.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And so all are cute, but now they're actually getting me gifts.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   But imagine if they're getting me a gift,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and they bought me an annual pass to Disneyland.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Some of you guys already know what I'm talking about.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Disneyland is not my favorite place.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And so I know some of you guys enjoy it, but that annual pass is a lot of money.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   So imagine if they pulled all their money, emptied their bank account,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   and they said, "We got you this gift."
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   My, obviously, response would be, "Why do you hate me?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Why are you trying to torture me?"
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Because they don't know my heart.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   So you can pour all your energy and effort and pull your money
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   into getting something and working towards something,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   but if you don't know the heart of God, you're going to miss the whole point.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And in the same way, people who don't understand the heart of God
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   can labor, sacrifice, give, and do all of that,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and you completely miss the whole point if you don't understand the heart of God.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   And that's the distinction between Saul and David.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Saul was a man who was seeking to do what he thought was right,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   but David was constantly concerned about God's heart.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   What is at the core of his heart?
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   In Matthew 28, 16-20, we call this the Great Commission.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And this Great Commission is something that Jesus said to his disciples
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   from the beginning, "Follow me, and I will make you disciples of men."
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   That was in the calling of the disciples.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   All throughout his training was to prepare them for this Great Commission.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   In fact, when we talk about God's heart,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   it doesn't begin with Jesus calling his disciples.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   The whole reason why Jesus even showed up and was humiliated,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   living and taking on human form, was for this purpose,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   to seek and save the lost.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   He said, "Son of man, do not come to be served, but to serve,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   It goes even beyond that, where from the very get-go, the fall of man,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   there was a promise that God made that the seed of the woman was going to come
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   and crush the head of the serpent.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   And so all of Old Testament history is God fulfilling the promise
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   that he was going to seek and save the lost.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   This is his heart.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   If you read the Scriptures without understanding this,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Scripture's not going to make a lot of sense.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   If you try to do inductive Bible study,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   and you disconnect it from God pursuing sinners,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   you're not going to understand why these things are so important.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   This is the heart of God.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   If you study it without knowing this,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   if you study it without understanding it and applying it,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   you're going to miss the whole point.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   You're going to get an annual Disney pass for God.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   You worked hard, you labored, but it's like, "You just don't know me."
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   This morning, I want to look at four aspects of the Great Commission
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   to help us to better understand his heart.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   First of all, to understand the Great Commission, the heart of God,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   you need to understand the context in which Jesus says this.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   In Matthew 28, verse 17, something very strange happens.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   You need to understand this to understand what's happening in the Great Commission.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Jesus, after the resurrection, told his disciples to meet him in Galilee
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   because Jerusalem is still dangerous.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   They're going back home, and remember the scene where Jesus sees his disciples.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   They went back to their old job, they're fishing.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Jesus calls them, restores Peter back, "Do you love me?"
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   He restores him back, and he tells them, "Then go feed my sheep."
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Now he's restored them, he's preparing them for ministry,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   and then he says this in verse 16,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   "But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus has designated.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   When they saw him, they worshipped him, but some were doubtful."
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Some were doubtful.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Now, were they doubting Jesus' authority?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Were they doubting Jesus' identity?
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   It just tells us that they just worshipped him.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   For them to worship him and yet doubt if he was the Son of God,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   it would have been blasphemous.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   No Jew would have ever gotten on their knees
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   and worshipped Jesus if they had any doubt of who he was.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   In fact, if you remember, Thomas is the first one,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   after meeting Jesus and making sure that the scars were real,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   he's the first one who kneels down and said, "My Lord and my God."
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   So it can't be that they were questioning who he was,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   because now he sees the resurrected Christ.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   In fact, if you read the word that's translated for doubt,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   this is what it says in the Greek dictionary.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Matthew 28.17 said, "The verb translated 'some doubted'
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   should rather be translated 'they hesitated.'
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   This refers not to the doubt of the disciples
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   concerning the identity of the risen Christ,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   because they recognized him fully.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   However, they hesitated in regard to their responsibility
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   to preach the gospel to the world,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   knowing that Jesus in his resurrection body
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   was no longer going to be on earth."
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   So this was not a doubt about Jesus' identity,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   because they already worshipped him.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   They're doubting themselves.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   They're hesitating, because they just failed miserably.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   They were so confident. Peter was so confident.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   He said, "They may all fail you, but I will not."
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And he took up the sword, and he was going to battle.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   All of them, when Jesus went to the cross,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   confused and afraid, hid themselves.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   After failing their final test, now Jesus says,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   "Now I'm going to commission you to go."
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   So one, they were hesitant because of their own ability.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Has he really chosen the right person?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   I mean, you say one of us already betrayed him,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   and he's gone. There's 11 of us left,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   but how many of the 11 of us are going to last?
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   And they're in Galilee now,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   and Jesus is going to send them back to the epicenter,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   where they crucified Christ,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   where the leaders and the Roman guards
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   can easily capture the disciples.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   If they were able to crucify somebody
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   who raised Lazarus from the dead,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   they would have no problem crucifying
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and killing the other disciples.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   So the hesitation wasn't about who Jesus was,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   but has he chosen the right person?
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Are we the right person? Are we going to fail again?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Are we going to pass the test?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   If they come, and they want to crucify us,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   who's to say this isn't going to happen again?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   So you can see the context of the Great Commission
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   is what leads us to Jesus
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   giving the assurance of the Great Commission.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   And so in the very next verse, it says,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   "As they doubted," verse 19,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   "go there," it said, verse 18,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   "all authority has been given to me
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   in heaven and on earth."
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   He said, "I'm not sending you because you've been trained.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   In fact, you failed miserably.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   I'm not sending you because now you have experience
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   that you--I picked men of courage."
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   He says, "No, I'm sending you with my authority,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   not your authority, not your ability,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   with my authority.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   When you preach the gospel,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   and you go as I tell you to go,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   just do exactly as I tell you.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   In fact, the power is not in you.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   It's not in your training. It's not in your experience.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   It's not because you were doing certain things
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   better than other people."
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   He says, in Acts 1:8, he says,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   "After all of that," he says, "don't go yet.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   You don't have the power. You don't have the ability.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   If left to your own, you will fail.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   You will fail."
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   He says, "When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   you will be my witnesses."
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Jerusalem, not only in Jerusalem, to Judea.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Because they were afraid if I go to Jerusalem,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   they're going to kill me.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   He said, "Not only are you going to succeed in Jerusalem,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   you're going to take the gospel to the next place in Judea.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   And then to Samaria, even in Samaria,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   where people hate the Jews, you're going to go there.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   And then you're going to go from there
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   to the remotest part of the world.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   You will be successful because I will ordain it."
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   So the authority of the Great Commission
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   is not our training, is not our ability,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   is not our knowledge, is not our know-how.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   He said, "It's with me.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   All authority has been given to me,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   so now you go with my authority."
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   You see in Acts 4.13, when Peter preaches his first gospel,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   in front of the very people who crucified Christ,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   where he himself was probably afraid,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   and he stands boldly and preaches the gospel,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   "You crucified the author of life."
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   I bet, humanly speaking, he was expecting to be crucified.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   But they respond to him.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   He said, "Now as they observed the confidence,"
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   in some of your translations, it said,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   "boldness of Peter and John,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   they were amazed and began to recognize them
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   as having been with Jesus."
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   They recognize.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   How did these fishermen, how did these uneducated men,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   who had no training, just out of nowhere,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   are speaking so boldly and so powerfully?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   And the only explanation that they can come up with is,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   "That sounds and looks just like the Jesus that we crucified."
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Their authority and their power must be coming from Christ.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   So even these non-Christians recognized
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   that their power and authority came from Jesus Christ,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   and that's exactly what Jesus said.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   "You will go with my authority.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   You will go with my power, not yours."
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   So the only thing that you and I need to be worried about
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   is to abide in Christ, to be with Christ.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Isn't that what Jesus says in John chapter 15?
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   "If you want to bear fruit," he said,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   "don't get training, memorize a lot of Scripture,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   get organized, have plans."
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   None of these things are innately wrong,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   but all he told us to do is to abide, abide.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Stick with me, stay with me, be devoted to me.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Sometimes abiding in Christ simply means not to quit.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Sometimes it means to obey.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Sometimes it would be to study, to pray.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   But sometimes to abide in Christ,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   to recognize our weakness, and just to persevere.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Because the power is not with you.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   It's not with me.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   The authority and the power of preaching the gospel
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   isn't because I lived a great life for the last three weeks,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   so now I'm equipped and I can do great things for God.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   No, because this is his heart.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   This is what he has called us to do,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   and this is what the authority that he has given
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   to his church to do.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   The power of the Great Commission is with Christ.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Third, the goal of the Great Commission is clear.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Make disciples.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Again, if you've been at church any period of time,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   you've probably heard so many messages on this topic,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   and the only imperative in the Great Commission,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   the only commandment in the Great Commission
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   is to make disciples.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   All the other words are supporting.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   To make disciples.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   Not gather people, but make disciples.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   If you look at Jesus' ministry, you had some
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   who reject Christ and they never followed him,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   so they're never called disciples.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   But when we use the word disciple, there's three groups.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   One, we have the apostles.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   We don't have apostles today, and we don't choose apostles.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Jesus himself chose the apostles.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   So when he says to make disciples,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   he's clearly not talking about them.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   And then there was a large crowd of people
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   where when Jesus was feeding the 5,000 in John 6,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   many of them wanted to make him king.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   But it also says in that text, when Jesus says,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   "I am the bread of life," he said it was hard
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   to understand him, and they reject Christ
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   and they walk away from him.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   They're called disciples, but only temporarily.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   So when he says to go make disciples,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   he's not talking about them.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   He's not talking about just gathering people.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Sometimes the language that we use
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   is churched and unchurched.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   So our goal of church is to get unchurched people
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   to be churched.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   That is not the goal of the Great Commission.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   The Great Commission is to call people to himself,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   to make disciples of Jesus Christ,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   not somebody who just didn't go to church
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   and all of a sudden go to church,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   somebody who didn't read the Bible, read the Bible,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   or sometimes to make an atheist
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   to say that they are a theist.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   It's to make disciples of Jesus Christ.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   You know, today we call ourselves Christians,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   but in the early church,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   what they called themselves was "The Way."
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   That was the name that they chose for themselves
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   in the early church.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   It was first used at the Church of Antioch, "The Way."
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   The way to what?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   The way to God is Jesus Christ, "The Way."
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   But later on, Christians were called
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   by non-Christians, "Little Christ."
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   That's what Christian literally means,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   "Little Christ."
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   That the Christians did such a good job
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   that when the non-Christians saw them,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   it's like, "There goes Little Christ."
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   All he's talking about is Christ,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   worshiping Christ, following Christ.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   He's our "Little Christ."
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   And so the very term "Christian" means "Little Christ."
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   And that's what making disciples ultimately is.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   It's to make "Little Christ."
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   So if somebody claims to be a Christian,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   doesn't act like a Christian, talk like a Christian,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   eat like a Christian, live like a Christian,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   they're not "Little Christ."
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   So the goal of the Great Commission
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   is to make disciples of Jesus Christ.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Now, that's probably not new to you.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Especially if you've been in the church
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   and you've participated in many send-off services,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   that's not new to you.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   But what may be new to you is behind the scenes.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   And I told you last week how Greek is a very precise language.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   And so some of you who may have taken Latin
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   may already know this,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   but the tense behind,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   tense and the voice in the Greek grammar
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   is extremely important.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   So I know some of you who are not here for,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   you know, to get too intense,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   but this is very helpful to understand, okay?
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   The word to make disciple
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   is in the aorist passive voice.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Aorist tense and passive voice.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   So if you've taken Latin or you've taken Greek,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   you already know what that means.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   The aorist is the simple past tense.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   It's an action that happened in the past
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   and it ended in the past, right?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   So they have 27 tenses
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   and there's a bunch of different kind of tenses under that,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   the perfect, the imperfect.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   The aorist tense is the most simple of the past tense.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   So it's a past tense.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   Now, so again, it's interesting
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   because this is an imperative to go make disciples,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   but it's in the past tense.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   And then the Greek has what's called the voice.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   And the voice is, you have three voices.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   You have the active voice,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   you have the middle voice,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   and you have the passive voice.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Those are the three voices.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   And this is all from one word, right?
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Active voice, to give you an example,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   is I punched you.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   I did the action.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   That's the active voice, right?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   The passive voice is you got punched, right?
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   You just sat there and you received the action.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   You got punched.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   The middle voice is I let myself be punched, right?
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   So you took some action.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   You didn't actually do the action,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   but you had some action in receiving that.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Do you understand?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Okay.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   I know school is over for some of you,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   but this is important, right?
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   So it's interesting that the only imperative
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   is in the aorist, past tense, passive voice.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   And so is the word go.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   It is in the aorist, past tense, passive voice.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   So it means be sent.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   So what does this mean in translation?
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   How can an imperative,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   where we are called to do something,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   we would automatically think that
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   it is in the active voice, progressive,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   like the present tense,
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   to go and actively make disciples,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   but it's in the past, passive.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   And so is the word go.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   You know what that means?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   This is a description of who we are.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   This is an action that has happened.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   You have been made a disciple maker.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   As soon as you became a Christian
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   and the Holy Spirit is in you,
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   you are making disciples.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   You are making disciples.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   You are making a disciple either of yourself
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   or you're making a disciple of Christ.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   But you are reproducing.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   You are reproducing.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   If you're a nominal Christian,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   you are reproducing probably nominal Christians.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Whatever you are,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   it's that God has made you a disciple maker.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   That's who you are.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   So when he says to make disciples
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   in the passive, past tense,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   he's basically saying live up to the calling
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   that you have been given,
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   the salvation that you have been given.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   That's why we are called witnesses.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   The Bible never talks about evangelizing.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   He says be a witness.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   What God has already created you to be.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   And so the word go is also in the past passive.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   To be sent, meaning you've been already sent.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   This is not something that you say,
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   you know what, I'm going to gear up
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   and I'm just going to go and reproduce
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   and do all of this.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Yes, there is our action involved,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   but this text is telling us this is who you already are.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   You've already been sent.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   You've already been sent.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   You've already been made a disciple maker.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   That's why the Bible says in Peter
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   that you are aliens and strangers in this world.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   You already are aliens and strangers.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   You don't have to be.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   The fact that you are a follower of Christ,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   if you are a genuine follower of Christ,
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   you don't belong here.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   It says in Philippians 3.24,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   our citizenship is in heaven from which
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   also we eagerly wait for a savior,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   Your citizenship hasn't been changed.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   Or you're not going and you have to change it.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   It's been changed.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Before you were a citizen of the United States
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   or before you were a citizen of any other country,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   it says you have become a citizen of the kingdom of God.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   You are.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   You're not in the process of being naturalized.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   You have been naturalized.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   So the very fact that you are a follower of Christ
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   and the Holy Spirit is in you,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   God made you to reproduce.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   God made you to go.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   You are already going.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   You may not pack up your bags and get on a boat
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   or get on a plane to go to another country.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   You may stay at home,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   but the fact that you are a Christian,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   you have already been sent.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   The question is do you realize that?
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   As we send off the Korea team,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   we're not just sending them off so that they can go
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   and then we stay.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   No, you've already been sent.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Whatever it is that you are doing, you've been sent.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Whoever you've been around, you've been sent.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   Whatever family you belong to, you've been sent
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   by the very nature of who you are.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   That's why it's in the past passive voice.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Either you can receive that
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   and live according to that
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   or you can just say, "You know what? Forget that."
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   A Christian who claims to be a Christian
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   who doesn't live according to the heart of God
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   is constantly frustrated.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   He's constantly frustrated.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   No matter how hard you work,
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   you just can't seem to get close to God.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   You know where that shows more than any other place?
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   In your prayers.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   I'm a Lakers fan, so Lakers are not in the final.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   I'm not as interested,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   but I've been watching the basketball games
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   and I know today is a big game.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   I just find enjoyment in watching.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   If you ask me, "Hey, have you been watching?"
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   "Yeah, I've been watching."
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   It's like, "Oh, did you see what Luka Dantic did?"
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   "He's Kyrie Irving."
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   "Did you watch the Celtics?"
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   "Who do you vote for?"
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   I'll have a deep conversation with you
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   or at least some level of conversation.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   If you ask me, "Did you watch the latest hockey game?"
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   I say, "I have no clue."
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   I don't even know what the rules are.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   All I know is that the sport allows you
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   to beat each other up as part of the game.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   I have no idea how that works.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   But it's very difficult to have a conversation
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   when you don't know what's in my heart.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   When you draw near to God through prayer
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   and you have no clue
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   that the heartbeat of our God is pursuing sinners
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   and you have no interest in that.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   So even when you pray, you're not confident
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   if you're praying according to his will.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   When the Bible says, "If you abide in me, my words abide in you."
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Ask whatever you wish.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   There was a condition to answer prayer.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   But because you don't understand the heart of God,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   you come and you talk about Disneyland, hockey,
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   whatever it is that's on your heart.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   On your heart, you bring to God.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   And that was the problem with Saul.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   He spent all his time pursuing his own heart
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   in the name of God.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Until you understand the heart of God,
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   that this is his heart.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   This is what he desires.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   And all of a sudden, you'll see prayer opening up.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   You'll see interaction with the Holy Spirit.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   You'll see all of a sudden confidence in prayer.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   And you realize that you've tapped into the heart of God
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   when you understand the Great Commission
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   is at the core of what everything he does.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   If you try to understand the New Testament
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   without understanding the Great Commission,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   it's not going to make much sense.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Why do we need to live holy?
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Why do we need to do this?
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   Why do we need to submit?
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Why do we need to be organized?
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   All of it for the purpose of being a greater light.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   But the light is not your pursuit.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   Like, why? I don't see any consequence in that.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   The method of the Great Commission, right?
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   It says to go, that we are to go.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   But here's the other thing.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   The other two verbs, right?
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   To baptize.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   It's in the present active voice.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   Make disciples.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   Going is in the aorist passive voice.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   But to baptize and to teach is in the present active voice.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   Present active voice meaning that you go.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   And active meaning that we're doing the action.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   Going is who you are.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Making disciples is what you have become.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   How do you do that?
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   By baptizing, right?
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   Now, again, in our culture,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   baptizing has become just nothing more
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   than a simple religious ceremony
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   that you do or don't do.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   It doesn't really matter, right?
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   In the early church, they took it very seriously, right?
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   In fact, the communion table was so serious,
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   it was so holy that anybody who participated
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   in an unworthy manner, they actually got sick or died.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   So baptism was one of two ordinances
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   that was given to us.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   And he says baptism has two significance.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   One, baptism symbolized conversion.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   So when he says to go baptize,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   it's to preach the gospel and convert somebody
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   who's headed one way and bring them to Christ.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   That's what baptism means.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   As somebody who is engrossed in another way of life,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   that by preaching the gospel,
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   they repent and come to Christ.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   That's what the first understanding
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   of baptism means, right?
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   Not to simply change where they are on Sunday, right?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Or sign off on membership,
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   but to actually convert someone to Christ.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   The second understanding of it
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   is the significance of entering
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   into a covenant community, right?
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   It is a marriage ceremony between God,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   between Christ and the sinner.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   And that's why we always say,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   before you come to the communion table,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   that if you're not baptized, not to come up,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   because the baptism is a ceremony
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   that unites us to Christ.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   And to uniting us to Christ means
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   that we're united to the body of Christ,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   which is the church.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   And so baptism means that you go
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   and fulfill what God has called you to do
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   by preaching the gospel
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   and causing them to participate
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   and be a part of the church.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Some people may say, "You know what?
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   "Preaching is the job of the pastors,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   "and I'm just not good at that.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   "I'm just going to be good.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   "I'm just going to do social justice
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   "and feed the poor and take care of the orphans,
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   "and by doing so, I'm going to shine the light."
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   The problem with that is the Buddhists do the same thing.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   The Catholics do the same thing.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   The Muslims do the same thing.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   And so if all you are doing is shining the light
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   by being a good person, you get the credit.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   You're a good guy.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Oh, you're very compassionate.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   But part of baptism requires preaching.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   You may never come up on the pulpit,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   but to make the gospel clear
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   to the people who are around you,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   how will they convert if they are not sent?
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   How will they know if you are not sent
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   if you don't go and you don't make it clear to them
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   what the gospel is?
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   And then he says to go,
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   "Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   "Disciple them."
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   He says in Ephesians 4, 11 through 16,
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   "He gave some as apostles, some as prophets,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   "some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   "for equipping of the saints for the work of service."
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   Equipping of the saints.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   So teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   meaning that you are being equipped for what purpose?
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   To serve other people.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   Your whole point of spiritual maturity
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   is not I got more Bible knowledge than I did before,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   which is important.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   I'm being more disciplined than before.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   He says no.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   He said all of the offices has been given
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   so that you may be equipped to what?
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   To serve other people.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   So if your maturity only leads to your benefit,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   you're not really mature.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   If all you've been doing in the church
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   is gaining knowledge and serving yourself,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   you're not really mature.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   He said the whole point of equipping
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   is so that you may serve to the building up
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   of the what? Body of Christ.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Not just simply you, but the church.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   Until we all attain what? Unity of what? Faith.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   You know, one of the most common things
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   that the church is dealing with,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   especially as the church grows, is unity.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   Because the church is big.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   When we were 30, 40 people, we're meeting at our house,
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   and unity was easy.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   Everybody goes to the same school.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   Everybody had black hair at one point.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   You know, we all ate the same food,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   hung out, you know, at Carl's Jr.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   And our life looked exactly the same.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   But as the church grows, it becomes more and more diverse.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   Different age brackets, different socioeconomic background,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   different experiences, and all of a sudden
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   it's very difficult to be united
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   if you're not united in faith.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   If what unites us is our past background,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   it's our culture, it's our language,
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   it's where we came from, our experiences,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   it becomes more and more difficult.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   The Bible never says to unite for those things.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   The unity in the church, as we mature in our faith,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   comes because of our faith.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   So if we're not growing in faith,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   whatever unity that you feel like you're experiencing
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   has nothing to do with Christ.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   That's the kind of unity you get
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   by hanging out with Dodger fans.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   That's the kind of unity you get
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   because these guys like the outdoors.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   It's very superficial.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   There's some level of unity there,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   but the unity in the church
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   is despite our differences,
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   despite the different backgrounds,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   united in faith
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   to a mature man, to know Christ,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   to the measure of the stature
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   which belongs to the fullness of Christ,
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   not to be satisfied just being far off
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   and appreciating Christ from a distance,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   but to seek Him, search Him, ask Him
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   that we may have the fullness of Christ.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   The problem that we face
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   when we get stagnant in our faith
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   and we're satisfied with so little.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   You don't go to the banquet
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   and eat the hors d'oeuvres and say,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   "This was great," and go home.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   Hors d'oeuvres were basically
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   to open up your taste buds.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   If the hors d'oeuvres are this good,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   imagine what the banquet's going to be like.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   So many Christians come
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   and they nibble in Christ,
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   but they're never passionately pursuing Christ.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   Your most passionate days
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   were when you were younger.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   And you've just kind of given yourself
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   to say, "Ah, that's young people."
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Whatever passion, that's what young people do.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   And as a result of that,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   you live off of the nibbling
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   that you experienced when you were young.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   But he says, "Teaching them to observe
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   "all that I have commanded you
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   "is so that we may attain the fullness of Christ."
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   That whatever goodness that you have tasted,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   the reason why God allowed you to taste it
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   is so that you may be drawn to Him further.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   Hunger and thirst for His full coming.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   If the nibbling was that good,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   imagine what it would be when Christ comes,
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   when the full banquet is open
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   to the fullness of Christ.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   As a result, we are no longer
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   to be children tossed here and there
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   by waves and carried about
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   by every wind of doctrine,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   rather by the trickery of men,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   by craftiness, deceitful scheming,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   by making the truth in love.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   Truth in love.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   The cross is the truth in love.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   The cross is the perfect combination
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   of God's righteousness
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   and His mercy and love.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   Any person or church
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   that diminishes one or the other
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   does not represent Christ.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   Because if you bring the grace of God
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   without the judgment of God
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   and the righteousness of God,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   the cross is not necessary.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   The cross was to satisfy the wrath of God,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   His holiness.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   So if all it is by grace,
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   He's so gracious, He's so loving,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   then the cross was unnecessary.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   If it was just a judgment,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   the cross is unnecessary.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   Because all you have to do is wipe us out.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   But the perfect union of truth and love
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   is at the cross.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   So that's why he says true maturity happens
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   when you don't neglect either.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   Where we speak the truth,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   where we preach the truth,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   we preach the imperative,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   we preach the standards of God,
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   we preach holiness of God,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   but do it in a manner in love, in grace.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   And when a parent learns
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   how to balance these two,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   you're a good father.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   Either you are gracious
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   and just let them do whatever they want
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   and they become spoiled
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   and they don't respect you
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   and they grow up to have a miserable life
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   because they think the whole world
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   revolves around them,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   or you're so harsh
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   that they don't know what love and grace is.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   And so they want to run as far as they can from you,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   as soon as they can.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   But being a good father,
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   being a good mother is learning.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   Learning to practice righteousness and love
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   at the same time with our children.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   Now we don't know that right away.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   We grow to become like that.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   And that's what the Bible says
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   that we are called to do,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   because that's what he practiced with us
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   and so he tells us to do the same.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   We are to grow up in all aspects into him
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   who is the head, even Christ,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   from whom the whole body,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   being fitted and held together
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   by what every joint supplies,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   according to the proper working
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   of each individual part,
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   cause the growth of the body
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   for the building up of itself.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   You know that your spiritual maturity
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   is needed for the whole church.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   If your whole spiritual life is about,
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   you know, I'm good with God.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   You don't know the heart of God.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   I will never say I'm good
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   if one of my children is not good.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   The greatest gift that my children can give me,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   and I think all parents will say the same,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   is be good to your brother.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   Be good to your sister.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   Because so much of my lifetime energy
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   and finances go to taking care of my own kids.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   Any parent would agree with me.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   Any father would agree with me.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   So the best gift that you can give me, right,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   be good to your brother.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   Help me love your brothers and your sister.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   And God, it would be no different.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   You cannot understand the heart of God
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   if you don't love the church.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   If you don't love the people in the church.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Yes, especially the ones that are harder to love.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   Especially the ones that are harder to love
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   because those people who are harder to love,
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   the only place where they will receive grace
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   is with you, is in the church.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   Because any other place they go,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   they're going to practice justice.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   You don't deserve grace.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   I'm not going to practice grace with you.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   You're a jerk, so I'm going to be a jerk to you.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   That's how the world functions.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Only in the body of Christ,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   we are called to love even our enemies.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   So if that's a child of God,
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   and you understand the heart of God,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   God calls us to love,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   especially the ones that are harder to love,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   to speak the truth in love.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   And then he says, "And lo, I am with you
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   "to the end of the age."
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   I am with you to the end of the age.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   You don't choose to go the path,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   and then Jesus is like, "Let me go with you."
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   That's not how that works.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   You don't pick and choose.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   Those of you who just graduated say,
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   "You know, what do I want to do with my life?
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   "What is my heart's desire?"
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   And then we create the work,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   and then we pray, "God, join me, please.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   "This is what I want.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   "Lord, join me, please."
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   No, if you understand the heart of God,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   and you walk the path that he walked,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   he says, "I will be with you.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   "I will be with you."
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   When we walk the path that he walked,
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   and that's why he said, "If you want to follow me,"
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   what did he say?
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   "Take the path that I took.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   "You pick up your cross, too.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   "You deny yourself, and you follow me."
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   And when you experience the fellowship of God,
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   the heart of God,
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   prayer opens up.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   Prayer opens up
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   because you understand what he desires.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   You don't have to be a pastor.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   You don't have to be a missionary.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   Whatever it is that you're doing,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   if you understand the heart of God,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   communication just opens up.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   Where you will see the conflict in your life
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   is at prayer.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   It's hard to have communion with God
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   when God is so concerned and consumed
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   with saving the lost,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   and we are not.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   That's why we have to understand
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   the context of this Great Commission,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   "Lo, I am with you to the end of the age."
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   I want to wrap up with three applications.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   First, the fathers.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   As we celebrate the Father's Day,
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   some of you guys have been fathers
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   just seconds, right?
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Pretty brand-new fathers in our church,
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   and you're kind of scrambling,
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   like, "What does it mean to be a good father?"
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   And then we have veteran fathers, right?
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   But whether you've been a father for 40 years
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   or whether you've been a father
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   for literally weeks,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   if you ask every father,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   like, "How do you be a good father?"
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   Nobody knows, right?
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   There are certain things that I wish I did different
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   when I was younger.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   I can make you a list of regrets.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   I don't regret anything that I've done at church.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   Not to say that I wouldn't do anything different
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   because now I have all this--
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   I know what it resulted in,
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   but at that time, whatever decision was made,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   it was made because we believed
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   that this was what God desired.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   So I don't regret anything.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   But as a father, I would say
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   there's things that I would do differently.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   I would have been probably a lot more patient
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   when I was younger.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   So I could list you the things
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   that I wish I could have done differently.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   But it's so overwhelming, right?
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   Because the end result is so important
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   because it's your children.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   And every father wants that for their kids.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   So I ask all of you to be patient, right?
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   Because your fathers are people who love you
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   and they're doing their best.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   Just like you do your best and you don't get an A, right?
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   Some of you worked hard and you didn't get an A.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   And so every father that I know is working hard,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   but maybe they didn't get an A, right?
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   But let me simplify fatherhood
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   according to the Bible.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   These are training, how do you discipline the kids
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   to providing and when to push and when to back off,
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   all of these things we're going to continue to struggle with.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   But it says one thing, only one thing is required.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   Be a man after God's own heart.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   Be a man after God's own heart.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   And if you pursue the heart of God,
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   you said God will be with you.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   God will be with you.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   In the midst of a storm, in the midst of chaos,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   in the midst of regret, God will be with you.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   For those of you who are graduates,
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   and some of you know exactly what you're going to do.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   Some of you are wondering what's the next stage in life.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   Some of you may go into grad school.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   Some of you may have a career.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   Some of you are just going to wander for a while, right?
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   Wondering what's the next stage in life is.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   Whatever that may be,
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   don't forget your primary goal in life.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   You are a disciple maker.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   You are an alien and stranger.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   And if you labor to make this place your home,
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   a better home,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   you will lose your life in that process.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   Only those who lose their life in Christ
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   will truly find it in Christ.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   So first and foremost, before you worry,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   overly worry about what the next stage in life is,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   first make sure,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   am I abiding in Christ?
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   Do I understand the heart of God?
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   And so whatever it is that you do,
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   whatever field that you get into,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   to be the light that God called you to be.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   And then finally, the mission team that is going.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   And I'm going to read three passages
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   as a request for prayer.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   2 Thessalonians 3 says,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   "Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   "will spread rapidly and be glorified,
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   "just as it did also with you."
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   One, as we go,
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   I know most of you who are Christians will agree with me
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   that preaching the gospel is necessary.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   But what we struggle with is the sense of urgency.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   We all live like we're going to be here forever, right?
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   Whether we're young or old.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   But Paul says to pray for us
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   so that it will spread rapidly, right?
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   That God would instill in us,
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   as you pray for us and as you are sent here,
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   that God would stir in us a sense of urgency
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   to get the gospel out.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   Because until you sense a sense of urgency,
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   you're not going to say no to God,
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   you're just going to say maybe later.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   Maybe when I'm better, maybe when I have a job,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   maybe when this.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   But I pray that God will stir in us a sense of urgency
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   to preach the gospel wherever we are.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   Colossians 4, 5,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   "Conduct yourself in wisdom toward the outside,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   "making the most of the opportunity."
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   You'd be surprised the kind of opportunities around you here.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   Most people think you're in Orange County,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   so everybody has heard the gospel,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   but they've already rejected it.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   That is not the case.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   You go out and talk to people around here,
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   you'd be surprised.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   Even people who have attended for 15 years,
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   you ask them, "How is one saved?"
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   They can't tell you.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   You'd be surprised.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   So there is a dire need here.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   The good thing is they're not closed to the gospel
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   because they go to church, some of them.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   Some of them fell out of the church.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   And so there is an openness toward the things of God
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   that we haven't seen in a long time.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   The pandemic has created a hunger for God
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   that I didn't see before the pandemic.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   So the opportunity is there.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   An opportunity is there for us when we go to Korea
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   because the younger generation,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   they haven't rejected Christianity.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   Most people who fell out of the church in Korea,
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   they don't say, "We hate Christianity."
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   They say they don't like the Christianity in Korea
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   because they've gotten so many reports
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   of pastors embezzling churches
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   and spending all their money
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   to build $100 million churches.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   And so they said they're not interested
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   in Christianity in Korea,
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   but they're open to have outsiders come
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   and share the gospel with them.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   So we found last year that they were
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   more than willing to talk to us.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   So they're not close to the gospel.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   They just don't want to hear it
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   from who they think are hypocrites.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   And the whole country is not like that.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   But that's the prejudice that they have to work through.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   So the door for the gospel is open there.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   And thirdly, Romans 1:16,
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   "For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   "for it is the power of God for salvation
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   "to everyone who believes,
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   "to the Jew first and also to the Greek."
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   We pray that, again, as we go,
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   that you would pray that we would be able to bear fruit,
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   even though it's a short period of time there,
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   that there would be a sense of urgency,
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   that we would make the most of every opportunity,
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   and that when that opportunity comes,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   that there would be a boldness
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   in preaching the gospel where we go.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   So let me pray for us,
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   and we'll have the praise team come back up.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   And, again, we presented the team here
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   because we wanted you to see their face
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   and pray for them.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   We'll be gone today and then be back on July 3rd
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   so that when they come back,
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   they would have great testimonies to share with us.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   Let's pray.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   Father, we thank you for your love and grace.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   We pray, Father God,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   that you would fill our hearts and mind
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   with you and your word.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   And as you have made us witnesses,
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   as you have made us aliens and strangers in this world,
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   that we would continue, Lord God,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   to preach the truth of your word,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   to baptize,
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   to teach all that you have commanded us,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   knowing, Lord God,
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   that you are with us everywhere we go.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   May Christ, in his name, in his name,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   only be exalted in this place.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   Amen.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   Sing, "Who, O Lord."
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   Who, O Lord, can save themselves?
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   Their own soul can heal.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   Our shame was deeper than the sea.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   Your grace is deeper still.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   Who, O Lord,
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   can save themselves?
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   Their own soul can heal.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Our shame was deeper than the sea.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   Your grace is deeper still.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   You alone can rescue.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   You alone can save.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   You alone can find us.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   You alone can let us out of hell.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   You alone we are the highest praise.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   Who, O Lord, has made our world a great divine place?
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   When our hearts were far away,
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   your love refused.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000]   Yes, your love goes further still.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   You alone can rescue.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   You alone can save.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   You can help us find us.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   Let us out of hell.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   You alone we are the highest praise.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   You alone we are the highest praise.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   You alone we are the highest praise.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   Lift them up now.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   Lift them up now.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   Lift them up now.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   Lift up our eyes.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   Lift them up now.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   You alone can rescue.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   You alone can save.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   You can help us find us.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   Let us out of hell.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   You alone we are the highest praise.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   You alone we are the highest praise.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   You alone we are the highest praise.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   Let's pray.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   the eternal love of God the Father,
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   rest, restore, encourage, and challenge us
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000]   that we may be the aroma of Christ wherever you send us.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   Amen.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   God sent his Son.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   They called him Jesus.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000]   He came to love.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   He left for good.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   He lived and died.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000]   To find my partner.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   Amen.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   And ever stand.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   All the power, all the glory, I will trust in his name.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   For my God is the ancient of days.
