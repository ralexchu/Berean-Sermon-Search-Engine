[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.000]   Let's take a moment to pray and go before the Lord
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.840]   as we start our weekday Bible study.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.680]   All right, God, we thank you, God, for your truth.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.960]   Lord, we recognize truly how powerful your word is
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.360]   because God, you're a powerful God.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.200]   We thank you so much that this word, which you describe
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.640]   as so precious, more to be desired than money and gold,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.920]   and sweeter, Father God, than any sweet thing in this world.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.800]   I do pray that we would all the more experience it, trust,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.240]   and continue to build our lives upon it.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.040]   And we again want to thank you.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.880]   Week in and week out, we have opportunity to study and learn.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.200]   And we do recognize, God, we feel
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.480]   how it continues to feed our soul
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.800]   and causes us to be strong in faith towards you, Lord.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920]   We want to thank you again and pray for a fruitful time
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.960]   of study this evening.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.560]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.280]   OK.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.040]   This evening, we are looking at Ephesians chapter 4,
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.080]   verses 11 through 16.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.480]   So let's take a moment to start reading.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.160]   I will start reading in verse 7 because, again, those
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.880]   were connected thoughts.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.560]   And in verse 7, it says, "But to each one of us,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.880]   grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.800]   Therefore, it says, when he ascended on high,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.400]   he led captive, a host of captives,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.600]   and he gave gifts to men."
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   Now, this expression, "he ascended," what does it mean
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080]   except that he also had descended into the lower
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.440]   parts of the earth?
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.520]   "He who descended is himself also he
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.760]   who ascended far above all the heavens
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.840]   so that he might fill all things."
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.520]   Our passage for today.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.720]   "And he gave some as apostles and some as prophets
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.920]   and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.480]   for the equipping of the saints for the work of service,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.440]   to the building up of the body of Christ
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.240]   until we all attain to the unity of faith
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240]   and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.200]   to the measure of the stature which belongs
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.360]   to the fullness of Christ.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.760]   As a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.480]   and there by waves and carried about
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.040]   by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.720]   by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.560]   But speaking the truth in love, we
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.280]   are to grow up in all aspects.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.160]   And to him who is the head, even Christ,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.680]   from whom the whole body being fitted and held together
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080]   by what every joint supplies, according
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.200]   to the proper working of each individual part,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.000]   causes the growth of the body for the building up
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.240]   of itself in love."
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.520]   OK.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.200]   This passage has a lot to say.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.000]   But I do want to make mention of the fact
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.760]   that this is a very pivotal and important passage
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.400]   to the doctrine of the church, namely
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.760]   how the church has been blessed, but also
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.280]   the vision of what the church should be like.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.640]   We're going to start with verse 11 that describes the gift,
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.440]   the gift that Christ has given.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.360]   Remember that in the last passage,
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.280]   we rehearse and review that Christ gave gifts.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   And what he talked about was to each one,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.880]   God has given gifts.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.760]   Christ as the victor, Christ as the conquering king,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.840]   has been generous with us, has been generous with the church.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.680]   And so he gives gifts to men.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.280]   And he has authority to do so.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.840]   And what he says here is that he gave some to be apostles,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.080]   and some as prophets, and so forth.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.720]   And so we have to ask the question, OK,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.800]   so clearly Christ has been generous.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.640]   What has he given?
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.880]   And what we already said was that the concept of gift
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.640]   in the New Testament has various different references,
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.320]   everything from your enablement, the skills that you have,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.920]   your disposition, your character traits, the things
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.600]   that you can use for the church.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.040]   We also talked about the Holy Spirit as a gift.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.120]   We talked about obviously having even the collective whole
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.240]   as a gift.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.080]   But more specifically, specific individuals,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.440]   the individuals that are given to the church,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.040]   and here, namely apostles, prophets, and evangelists,
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.760]   pastors, teachers.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.080]   So we essentially want to say that.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.320]   But what I like to do is whenever
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.360]   I make observations about a passage,
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.320]   and there happens to be a listing,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.480]   I actually try to list it.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.000]   And I recommend you do the same.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.920]   Why?
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.800]   Because every time you see a list,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.200]   you do want to observe and ask the questions of,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.000]   is there a theme there?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.040]   Is there a sequence?
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.600]   Is there an order?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.920]   And the observation that I see is that, yes, there
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.640]   does seem to be a sequence.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.560]   Why?
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.160]   Because this order appears in other passages of the New
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.400]   Testament as well.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.200]   For example, 1 Corinthians chapter 12, verse 28 through 31.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.360]   In this passage, Apostle Paul says,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.080]   "And God has appointed in the church first apostles,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.440]   second prophets, third teachers.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.960]   Then miracles, then gifts of healing,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.320]   helps, administration, various gifts of tongues."
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.200]   All are not apostles, are they?
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.080]   All are not prophets, are they?
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.440]   All are not teachers, are they?
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.720]   And so there are specific designated gifts.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.720]   But what's more, there seems to be an order of the gifts,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.360]   where it says first, second, and third.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.920]   What's more, when we take a look at Ephesians chapter 2,
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.760]   verses 19 through 20, it talks about the building
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.560]   of the house, and there's always a sequence to a build.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.920]   Verse 19 says, "So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.320]   but you are fellow citizens with the saints,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.240]   and are of God's household.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.080]   Having been built upon the foundation of the apostles
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.320]   and prophets, Christ Jesus himself
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.040]   being the chief cornerstone."
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.520]   So within the blueprint, within your build order,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.400]   Christ is going to be the cornerstone that
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.680]   sets the lines.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.480]   He's going to be the one that sets
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.920]   the trajectory of how things should be laid out.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.440]   And there is the foundation, the doctrinal foundation
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.120]   of the teachings that have been given to the apostles
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.760]   as ones sent from Christ.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.640]   That being the case, there is significance to these things,
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.680]   that there is this order by which Christ has given,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.880]   as a very then valuable and significant gift,
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.000]   that the church should have these apostles, prophets,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.840]   shepherds, evangelists, pastors, and teachers.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.600]   Now in thinking about that, though,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.680]   we take a look at the list and we're kind of wondering,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.480]   hmm, OK, so there seems to be an order,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.160]   there seems to be a significance,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.280]   but how do they differ?
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.320]   Who are these people?
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.440]   Is there any similarity?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.520]   Those kind of questions are all questions
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   maybe we should ask.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.080]   But one other interesting thing that we notice
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.800]   is that some of the terms in the Bible that we see,
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.960]   we actually don't see in this list.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.480]   So this is something, you don't have to jot down everything
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.080]   because it's going to take you a while,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.240]   but I just wanted you to notice that within the Bible,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.920]   there are lots of different titles for people.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.880]   There are different types of leadership.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.600]   So some of the ones that we're more accustomed to
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   and hear often are elders.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.800]   How come they're not on the list?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.400]   They're like leaders of the church.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.080]   Deacons and servants who are ministers,
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.920]   like why aren't they on the list?
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.280]   What's going on?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.760]   And so an important observation that we make is this, OK?
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.200]   An important observation is that there is a unifying form,
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.960]   sorry, a unifying function of the individuals
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.520]   that have been listed.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.760]   And what is that unifying function?
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.720]   That unifying function is that all of them have to do
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   with the teaching of the foundational doctrines of Christ,
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.280]   essentially the proclamation of the truth.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.080]   Pretty much all the commentators that I read
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.720]   kind of uniformly agreed that the highlight of this
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.920]   is as he comes down this list, apostles and prophets,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.640]   these are not offices for the church.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.800]   The highlight is not the offices of the church.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.720]   Why?
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.720]   Because we have not been given instructions,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.600]   go therefore and establish apostles at your church.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.800]   Those are uniquely God-given specific roles and privileges
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.480]   in the sense that Christ has given them authority
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.560]   to teach with his authority.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.080]   And upon that teaching that has been handed down to us
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.080]   once and for all, we are continuing to minister the truth.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.960]   OK?
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.840]   So that being the case,
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.680]   clearly this is not a delineation of,
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.680]   these are all the offices you should have at your church.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.560]   'Cause some of them are already passed.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.680]   They don't exist anymore, right?
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.000]   But rather it is highlighting this idea.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.120]   A gift to us is the word.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.640]   The word is light.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.920]   The word is better than sweet honeycomb, better than money.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.120]   The word is better than the wisdom of the world.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.240]   The word is actually better than you
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.560]   trying to go and pursue happiness in life.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.720]   Why?
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.600]   Because the word is God's reality.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.360]   And living in God's reality is the greatest blessing.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.960]   What am I trying to say here?
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.960]   We should meditate on the fact that the invaluable,
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.920]   the precious gift that God has given,
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.760]   yes, are these individuals.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.440]   But these individuals have a primary function of teaching.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.160]   They are to be the ground laying workers in the church
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.960]   who have laid a foundation of doctrines for us to believe.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.360]   And therefore hitting this idea again for our church.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.400]   Let's take a moment to meditate on that.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.920]   If, if we jettison the preaching of God's word
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.640]   faithfully to you,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.200]   we are completely jettisoning Christ's gift, right?
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.480]   If the foundational truths that we have been receiving
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.920]   and our role then as pastors and teachers
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.040]   are to give to you as a blessing to the church,
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.320]   as an edifying force in the church,
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.640]   as a sanctifying force in the church,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.080]   we're completely misusing God's gift.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.760]   It would be like having this, like a Apple product,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.560]   which is a laptop computer that I bought five years ago,
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.960]   serving me well.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.880]   It's useful for preparing sermons,
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.480]   studying, typing up my notes.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.840]   It's powerful equipment, right?
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.440]   But instead I'm like, nice, thank you.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.600]   And I started saying, let me turn up the screen brightness
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.920]   and use it as a lamp.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.480]   So I could use my number two pencil
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.160]   and write down my notes on a piece of paper, right?
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.240]   Like that would be ridiculous.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.280]   What a waste.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.440]   Yeah, as a matter of fact,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.360]   if we continue to jettison God's word within the church,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.400]   absolute waste, but more than that,
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.960]   in Old Testament,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   if God has given us the blessing of the truth,
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.800]   meaning if God has given the nation of Israel,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.360]   his proclamation,
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.400]   and they instead turn to the wisdom of the world,
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.680]   it's like, but they have kings over there.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.200]   If they turn to the wisdom of Egypt and say,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.640]   but that nation is powerful.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.160]   That is not seen as a waste.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.120]   That is seen as betrayal.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.160]   This loyalty and a front against God's gift, right?
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.120]   Now, why am I saying this?
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.040]   Is because even in our day,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.200]   there are things that people turn to
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.400]   aside from the word of God.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.480]   And the point that I'm making is not so much like,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.320]   whoa, right?
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.880]   It's just simply that not everything is neutral.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.000]   Things compete for our loyalties.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.560]   Things compete for our mind and our heart.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.760]   And what's more, we always want to think and consider
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.840]   our Lord Jesus Christ in his victorious nature
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.720]   has given the church various gifts.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.240]   And then for us to not fully commit,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.800]   not fully accept it would be a big, big offense to him.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.600]   Okay, number two.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.560]   In number two, the scripture says,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.280]   for the equipping of the saints for the work of service
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.680]   to the building up of the body of Christ.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.560]   So Christ has a very specific intent
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.920]   of why he gave those gifts to the church.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.080]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.960]   The intent.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.000]   And so what we want to say is purpose, objective.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.720]   What does God purpose in the teaching of the word,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.760]   in the various titles and positions that are there?
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.040]   And also more specifically,
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.000]   these gifts in history that God has given
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.040]   in terms of specifically the apostles, prophets,
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.200]   evangelists and so forth, okay?
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.040]   So when we take a look at this passage,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.760]   again, I just want to highlight that in good Bible study,
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.640]   we pay attention to prepositions.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.920]   Why?
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.440]   These prepositions I highlight for you.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.160]   For, for, to.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.320]   Prepositions just gives you relationships
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.840]   between words and nouns, right?
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.960]   And phrases.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.720]   So what you should be thinking is,
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.400]   what is the relationship of thought here?
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.280]   And you totally see a progression.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.200]   This is for the purpose of this and for the purpose of that.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.520]   And you just naturally see a build.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.440]   Okay, I just want to highlight that.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.840]   And what's more, he says that this is for the equipping,
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.160]   working and building.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.680]   So there are some unique terms
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.280]   that we should pay attention to.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.120]   I just want to comment on these just briefly here.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.640]   First, I actually want to start with the idea
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.080]   of building up the body of Christ.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.600]   Let's take a moment to think about this.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   An objective and purpose that I know God is doing right now.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.120]   He desires in this day, in our generation,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.960]   but also in this day, to continue to build up his church.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.680]   That is something I know for sure.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.760]   People ask me sometimes for advice.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.480]   Is it God's will for me now to do this?
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.680]   Is it for now God's will for me to do that?
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.640]   To be single, to be in this job?
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.840]   And there's a lot of questions.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.760]   Now, a lot of times we recognize
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.320]   that there's a general will of God.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.520]   He always wants to draw you near to him.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.440]   He wants to build you up in your character
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.640]   that's more closer to his own image.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.040]   He wants to make sure that he's sanctifying you.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.600]   He's all that stuff, right?
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.240]   But one of the short things we can say is,
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.120]   this is a purpose, an objective of God.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.160]   And what's really interesting is that he uses a term
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.200]   that has a very kind of literal and specific nuance,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.360]   which is, he's not just generally building,
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.520]   it literally means to be building a home.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.480]   It's there in the Greek, oikodome, okay?
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.160]   Oikodome.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.360]   And so when we think about that,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.200]   we recognize that what he is building,
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.360]   we rehearse what he said before, it is his dwelling.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.200]   When you think about his church,
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.400]   what we have here at Berean,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.800]   again, by our eyes,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.200]   we just see a gathering of a mass of people.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.640]   But what we should be also seeing
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.840]   is God is building his loving home.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.440]   God is building his dwelling place.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.280]   He said his temple, right?
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.520]   And so here's this question then for us,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.800]   for us, we have to ask this question.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   Have I also then bought into that objective and purpose?
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.160]   Is that to me, something of a conviction?
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.920]   I know what God is doing,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.600]   and therefore I've completely aligned myself
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.960]   to that goal and purpose.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.920]   If that's his intention, so is mine.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.280]   What's more, he says to that end,
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.800]   there should be equipping of the saints
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.760]   for the work of service, okay?
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.800]   Equipping of the saints for the work of service.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.200]   Let's ask this question.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.320]   What does it mean to equip, okay?
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.800]   We recognize that clearly for the building up of the church,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.480]   the building up of the church does not happen
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.720]   just because we have crazy professionals.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.160]   The building up of the church does not happen
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.520]   just because we have crazy finances
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.040]   and a crazy building, right?
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.600]   The building up of the church happens
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.360]   through the equipping of the saints for the work of service.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.400]   But what does this equipping mean?
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.040]   I highlight it because the definition of this term
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.880]   when we do a word study specifically of equipping,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.720]   it is the word, "Ketartismus,"
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.400]   and it means perfection or completion.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.160]   The word dictionary of the New Testament says
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.520]   this differs from another term, "Ketartisis,"
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.760]   which is talking about the act of fitting something in
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.400]   or making perfect.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.320]   But he says the term used here is actually talking about,
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.080]   it denotes the process as completed.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.880]   So what am I saying?
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.600]   I recognize from that, that when we think of equipping,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.720]   we're probably thinking of something far too narrow.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.160]   What do I mean?
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.440]   I think in error, sometimes when we think of equipping,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.680]   we think of educational study.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.600]   We think of, let's run a class.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.200]   Let's have this training where you sit
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.600]   and a pastor teaches you, right?
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.160]   And then, or what's more, we say, you know what?
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.080]   You should tag me.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.840]   You should tag along with what I do,
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.880]   and we should kind of do it like maybe the medical field.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.800]   You're gonna be a resident,
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.880]   and you're just gonna walk alongside me, right?
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.120]   But when we think about equipping,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.280]   here, it's a pretty broad term,
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.880]   general perfection and completion.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.920]   Now, here's another passage in Hebrews 13, it says this,
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.800]   "Now the God of peace who brought up from the dead
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.120]   "the great shepherd of the sheep
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.600]   "through the blood of the eternal covenant,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.040]   "even Jesus our Lord,
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.000]   "equip you in every good thing to do his will,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.360]   "a working in us that which is pleasing in his sight,
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.480]   "through Jesus Christ to whom be the glory
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.120]   "forever and ever, amen."
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.400]   So what we see there is the equipping
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.080]   should be in every good thing.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.120]   Why do I bring this up?
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.800]   Because the tendency that I see sometimes
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.640]   is a lot of times people have a narrow view
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.160]   of what equipping means.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.960]   Typically, they think equipping to lead a small group,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.680]   equipping to lead and teach,
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.800]   equipping to be essentially somebody
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.000]   who is higher up on the hierarchy.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.240]   But that's not necessarily the case.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.440]   Because plus, not only is the term broader than that,
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.200]   we recognize that generally,
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.080]   as the scripture speaks about equipping,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.040]   it is not just education.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.280]   To do a specific task, such as leading.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.680]   Do equipping comes to us through the scriptures?
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.120]   Primarily, yes.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.240]   I mean, 2 Timothy 3.16,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.320]   the word of God is sufficient for everything.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.160]   To make us wise unto salvation,
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.200]   but to make sure that we're all equipped,
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.240]   thoroughly equipped that we can be,
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.840]   you know, to do every work.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.400]   However, the scriptures talk about the fact
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.880]   that our prayers continue to equip us.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.800]   What's more, the exhortation that we hear
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.920]   from our brothers and sisters,
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.120]   the accountability, the admonishment to flee sin
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.840]   and to obey in greater measure,
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.640]   that's all equipping too.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.880]   The testing and suffering, whoa.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.240]   Testing and suffering is actually a huge disciplinary,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.880]   equipping and training.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.080]   I mean, you think about the passage in James,
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.760]   you think about the passage in 1 Peter 1.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.040]   We essentially need to go through these various trials
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.280]   because those trials is going to have
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.200]   its necessary effect in us.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.840]   What I'm saying is, more broadly speaking,
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.200]   the scripture is talking about equipping,
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.680]   maybe more than what perhaps we presume equipping might mean.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   The observation and engagement of our community,
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.720]   the people around us who are mature,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.400]   the practice of our faith in discernment.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.440]   Scripture essentially says,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.280]   our maturity is going to come,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.440]   our discernment is going to come
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.240]   by those who actually practice it
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.520]   and in greater measure,
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.480]   a fuller application of what we already know.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.240]   And so Apostle Peter says, you know what?
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.920]   I don't mind repeating stuff over and over again.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.080]   And as a matter of fact, I think about my own ministry,
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.160]   just the teaching that I've done over the years.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.640]   And in that teaching,
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.880]   there's so many things I repeated
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.680]   over and over again.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.000]   And thank goodness the word of God
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.680]   never ceases to amaze, it's so deep.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.960]   But a lot of that actually is repetition
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.240]   of the same concepts,
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.640]   just in fuller measure and fuller application.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   And so all that to say is,
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.000]   I want you to take a moment to think about this.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   If I'm not thinking like, yeah,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.080]   I need to be equipped to lead,
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.720]   but I'm thinking like,
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.040]   I need to be equipped to go love my brother,
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.840]   to bear his burdens.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.800]   Like what is it that you're not equipped with
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.400]   that you can't go to a brother and be like,
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.520]   how are you doing this week?
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.280]   Especially during this time of the shelter at home,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.200]   are you doing okay?
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.240]   Brother says, yeah, I'm struggling with this
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.080]   and this and this.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.000]   He says, I'll pray for you.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.840]   Call him again and say, you know,
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.720]   I was just curious, like how are your parents doing?
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.920]   'Cause man, they are at risk and stuff like that.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.120]   And I know their health is not good.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.960]   Are they doing okay?
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.200]   And you continue to check up on him.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.480]   And then you start saying, oh, you share,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.840]   can I share with you my encouragements
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.680]   and how I'm struggling?
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.120]   And you go and interact.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.520]   And then you eventually say to like,
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.880]   more specifically with your love for Christ
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.760]   and your private faith in the Lord,
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.920]   like how's that doing?
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.280]   What equipping do you lack?
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.720]   I'm saying this not to say that you don't need training
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.640]   and that equipping is all bad.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.920]   I'm saying this to say that perhaps sometimes
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.480]   what we think about as equipping
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.280]   is not necessarily done specifically
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.480]   in a formalized classroom setting,
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.680]   which a lot of people sometimes expect.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.320]   And so I just wanted to highlight that by saying
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.080]   the equipping is probably broader
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.560]   than what we normally may think of.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.000]   Next, as we think about this though,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.520]   Apostle Paul has shown to us Christ's intent
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.280]   as he gives gifts, that he desires this purpose
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.000]   that the saints be equipped, that we be trained
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.360]   and that we are grown and that we're maturing
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.920]   by doing the works of service,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.560]   the works of service that includes far more
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.160]   than just leading stuff.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.440]   Works of service that means serving the brother next to us,
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.800]   serving the needs that we see
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.680]   and applying everything that we can.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.800]   And then what he says is,
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.400]   all of that is going to build to
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.520]   until we all attain and have this result.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.040]   So the way I label this is when I see again,
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.440]   these prepositional phrases, until we all attain to
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.600]   and as a result, I should be thinking,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   man, this is like a broader goal.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.880]   Like God has a very order and structure
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.720]   where he's thinking there are purposes and objectives
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   that are leading to a grand vision of the church.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.680]   And that's why this passage is great and amazing
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.200]   and we should take time to appreciate it
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.160]   because it gives to us kind of the idea that God has
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.200]   when he's thinking about the picture of the church.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.640]   And what does he say?
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.600]   He says, until we all attain to the unity of faith
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.560]   and of the knowledge of the son of God,
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.240]   to a mature man and to the measure of the stature
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.000]   which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   As a result, we are no longer to be children
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.760]   tossed here and there by waves
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.680]   and carried about by every wind of doctrine
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.160]   by the trickery of men,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.480]   by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.960]   But speaking the truth in love,
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.560]   we are to grow up in all aspects
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.160]   and to him who is the head, even Christ.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.960]   Brothers and sisters, this is a tall, tall order.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.000]   This is a big vision.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.080]   This is perhaps in some people's mind, like impossible.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   Right?
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.280]   This is huge.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.200]   So let's take a moment to appreciate all this stuff.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.640]   First, he talks about the unity of faith.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.920]   Unity of faith.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.640]   He is talking about the fact that we have this one baptism,
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.040]   one faith, one spirit, one father, one truth.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.880]   And so we are bound together in such a way
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.400]   where we have the same dedication
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.520]   to the same doctrine, the same truth.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.880]   And so we're supposed to have in other parts of scripture
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.400]   a same intent.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.840]   Intent on the same thing, set on the same purposes.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.320]   And the passage actually commands us
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.680]   to have similarity of mind.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.040]   Now, somebody perhaps might look at that and say,
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   "What?
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.960]   "What a herd mentality."
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.800]   Right?
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.080]   We're being brainwashed to think the exact same stuff.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.120]   But the thing about it is, yes,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.880]   if we have a unity,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.800]   where for the sake of pragmatism or practicality,
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.880]   you all should just believe what I say,
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.280]   then that would be wrong.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.480]   Or if in the sense of,
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.560]   "Hey, this is not gonna work
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.280]   "if we have different types of people.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.120]   "So we're just gonna all move in the same pattern."
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.640]   That would be wrong.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.400]   But the fact of the matter is we are one herd.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.280]   We're sheep.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.480]   But the great truth is we are sheep of the great shepherd.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.200]   And just like that video we saw a couple of weeks ago,
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.120]   we all perk up when we hear the voice of our master,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.160]   and we all come running
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.480]   when we hear the voice of our master.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.840]   That is no faulty thing.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.880]   That is no foolish thing.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.920]   When in fact you have the foundation of God's own voice
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.320]   being what unites us.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.760]   It would be a foolish thing
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.920]   to just be thinking outside the box
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.040]   for the sake of thinking outside the box.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.680]   You can't be different just to be different.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.760]   That in and of itself is also foolishness as well.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.960]   But the point that I'm kind of getting at here is this.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.840]   The kind of unity that God desires to see in us,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.320]   the degree and level of like-mindedness
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.400]   that God wants to see in all of us.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.600]   I want us to understand that that unity is so high
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.120]   'cause he wants us to have that element
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.640]   where we are of absolute one faith.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.800]   So moving forward to next,
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.000]   the knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I would like to highlight and draw your attention
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.160]   to an observation of a word study here
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.200]   on the term knowledge.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.600]   In the Greek there are several terms for the word to know.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.040]   There's oida, there's gnosko.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.200]   This passage particularly uses the word epignosko.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.280]   It is absolutely intensified.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.160]   Again, from the word dictionary of the New Testament,
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.720]   it says, "This knowledge is intensified
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.240]   because it expresses a more thorough participation
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.040]   in acquiring of the knowledge on the part of the learner.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.400]   It often refers to knowledge
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.120]   which very powerfully influences
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.920]   every form of religious life,
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.200]   a knowledge laying claim to personal involvement."
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.680]   Take a moment to think about that,
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.440]   that your experiences,
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.280]   it's both personal,
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.080]   there is personal investment and engagement.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.960]   And all of that happens to surround your experience
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.160]   with the person of Christ, right?
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.840]   If you've had experience with another individual
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.320]   and you've had shared life patterns
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.720]   and moments when you can, you know, reminisce together,
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.240]   those are such unique ties.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.880]   Right now, a lot of people are sharing their reflections
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.560]   but also their testimony
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.120]   and moments of hardship that drawn them closer to God
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.400]   on the Facebook and over the internet.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.560]   And some people comments like,
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.240]   "Oh, I remember your before Christ days
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.000]   and you're crazy and all that kind of stuff."
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.840]   And then they're like,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.080]   "But remembering Christ, how He's good to you,
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.680]   how He changed you, like, thank you so much for sharing."
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.520]   And when we do that, there is immediately a connection.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.800]   Because we're talking about the picture of the church,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.360]   think about this, every single one of us
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.880]   has some of the most moving
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.520]   and deepest experiences with Christ.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.440]   And we all can share it
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.000]   because we've been walking with the Lord.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.120]   What an amazing thing that would be.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.680]   What's more, he says, that there should be maturity,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.880]   maturity, that we would all, again,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.360]   this is not satisfied with a bunch of people
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.480]   with a bunch of people over here
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.000]   and a bunch of people over there being mature,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.480]   but until we all attain to the maturity, that of Christ.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.720]   And I want you to think about this.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.200]   I mean, to the church,
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.840]   its unity would be so developed and heightened
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.720]   if people were growing in their personal maturity.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.360]   If we were selfish, we would be thinking,
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.440]   "You know what?
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.600]   I want what I want, I want it now."
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.360]   Like, that would be absolute childishness, right?
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.560]   That's immaturity.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.880]   A lack of self-control, it's like,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.840]   "I'm just gonna do it, I don't care.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.080]   Not thinking about consequences.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.280]   I don't care if it hurts you, who cares?"
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   Like, that's all childishness.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.080]   But if you're able to think about having self-control,
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.760]   being able to die to self,
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.400]   having that kind of maturity
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.360]   to think above and beyond your own wants,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.240]   that would be such a thing
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.360]   where our Father in heaven would look down.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   And again, because we're talking about the grand vision,
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.920]   think about the vision of the Father.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.440]   Why would He not want us to mature in that fashion?
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.480]   Us as His sons and daughters.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.800]   And you know, I do believe
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.240]   that there is this interaction
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.200]   where God is looking at His sons and daughters
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.760]   and desiring to be proud
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.280]   as we grow in maturity towards the image of Christ.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.080]   There's a thought that I think about.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.560]   One time I went on a mission trip
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   and even with a great team,
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.880]   sometimes within mission trips,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.160]   as you're trying to do hard stuff,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.320]   moving from here to here, the discomforts,
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.920]   there was some strife.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.720]   And there was this time, there was an intense moment
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.760]   where it started getting all kind of crazy.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   Some words were said, words weren't careful,
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.160]   and then things started to escalate.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.600]   And within that kind of escalation,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.000]   things got really heated and emotional and stuff like that.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.880]   But one of the team members,
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.200]   as they kind of noticed and saw,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.840]   they could have easily just been like,
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.760]   "What's going on?"
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.360]   And been like, "I'm out of here.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.480]   "No thank you."
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.200]   But instead, they stepped in.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.800]   Now, they didn't step in a manner where it was like,
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.640]   "You know what?
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.480]   "What are you talking about?
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.320]   "What are you talking about?
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.160]   "Say your piece."
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.280]   It wasn't like that.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.440]   They stepped in with a sense of just like,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.280]   "You know what?
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.780]   "I wanna take responsibility.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.960]   "We could have done a lot better."
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.400]   Apologized, they heard the personnel,
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.240]   and they completely deescalated by their humility,
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.440]   their willingness to absorb.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.600]   Maybe their expectation was wrong.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.680]   Maybe their expectation was unfair.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.040]   But nevertheless, they submitted to one another
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.880]   in that fashion.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.360]   Man, on the bus ride home, I was just so proud of them.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.520]   I leaned over and I was like,
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.960]   "I'm so proud of you."
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.480]   Because I was.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   But again, thinking about the larger church picture,
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   when we are exercising greater maturity
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.000]   because of our ability to express
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.240]   and do what Christ has done,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   our Father would be proud.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.560]   Now, moving forward,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.880]   here in this passage it says,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.400]   "To the measure,"
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.520]   or sorry, yeah, "To the measure of the stature
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.060]   "which belongs to the fullness of Christ."
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.660]   If you actually take a moment to think about that,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.640]   that's crazy.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.120]   To the stature of Jesus Christ?
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.840]   This must be talking about the end times.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.720]   This must be talking about when we're glorified in heaven.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   No, our God desires us to move in that direction now.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.240]   And even if we think in our own minds,
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.920]   like, "That's like asking us to clean the ocean.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.240]   "Can't do that.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.120]   "I'm a land animal."
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.960]   Right, like, what are we supposed to say to that
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.760]   when God asks us to do something far above, beyond
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.120]   what we think is capable?
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.800]   God's gonna look at us and say,
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.960]   "How many things that I call you to do
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.520]   "that's impossible for man,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.080]   "but that he is going to empower?"
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.560]   And so be encouraged that this desire of God
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.880]   to strengthen and cause us to mature
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.840]   to the measure of Christ is something he is working in us.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.440]   And he desires to see in the grand picture
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.720]   all of us attain to that.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.480]   And the question to you is,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.400]   have you said, "Yes, Lord, thank you."
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.040]   Or have you said, "No, Lord, that's impossible."
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.120]   That is for us to submit to,
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.640]   not only submit to, but buy into.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.360]   And then he says, "As a result,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.960]   "we are no longer children,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.600]   "tossed here and there by waves
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.840]   "and carried about by every wind of doctrine,
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.240]   "by the trickery of men,
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.400]   "by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.960]   "But speaking the truth in love,
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.760]   "we are to grow up in all aspects,
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.360]   "and to him who is the head, even Christ."
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.840]   Let's take a moment to think about that again,
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.920]   continuing this vision, the goals.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.600]   He wants the resulting effect to be that we are like adults.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.400]   We're maturing in a way where we're no longer like children,
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.040]   tossed here and tossed there,
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.440]   and he described what children are like.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.160]   What are children like?
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.240]   Well, we can think about everything wrong with children,
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.040]   but here he's talking specifically about the fact
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.680]   that there is no stability.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.400]   You're just tossed here and there.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.520]   Car goes by, you're chasing that.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.200]   Ball rolls by, you're chasing that.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   Harsh just come and you're way over there.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.600]   And rather than being able to resist the tides
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.440]   that are coming,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.840]   you're locked up and you're miles away from home, right?
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.040]   What's more, being unable to discern.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.320]   This is false, right?
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.440]   Adulthood means you've experienced life enough,
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.240]   you've exercised your brain,
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.920]   you've learned something to the degree that you can say,
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.880]   "That's not true.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.280]   "We should grow in our ability to do that."
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.920]   What's more, being able to tell
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.360]   what is the crafty scheming of our enemy,
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.920]   that we're able to exercise our discernment,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.600]   and that we're able to see these are not in pattern
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.160]   in keeping with God's truth.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.080]   We're supposed to be able to do those things.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.800]   And the question is, are you growing in them?
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.160]   Are you learning to be able to discern?
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.480]   And rather than just going here and there,
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.360]   rather than following words here and word there,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.960]   we are to be able to have the word of God in us
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.880]   that we are able to speak the truth in love.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.720]   And that's the kind of maturity and adulthood
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.600]   that God wants to see.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.000]   And the thing about it is simple,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.440]   speak the truth in love.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.280]   It's not that easy, is it?
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.800]   I mean, as a father, I want so dearly
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   to speak to my children always with both strong instruction,
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.360]   but to make sure they know I love them.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.440]   You know, I'm sure you guys can relate.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.120]   It's difficult to not speak truth
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.160]   with a tone of annoyance, right?
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.880]   Like, "What are you doing?"
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.280]   Right, it's just so hard not to be so annoyed.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.440]   But the thing about it is maturity will teach you,
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.400]   and through the practice of speaking truth,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.040]   you have to do it in love, you realize.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.880]   Why?
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.040]   Because scripture straight up tells you
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.080]   you're going to be noisy.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.200]   If we think, "You know what?
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.160]   "I don't wanna speak truth.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.800]   "I'm just gonna say whatever comes, and you take it."
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.160]   That's like machine gunning everybody.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.200]   It's like, "Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz."
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.840]   And I hope that it hits you, right?
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.680]   No, it's not gonna.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.240]   You're just gonna spray.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.040]   You're not gonna be poignantly hitting what's needed,
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.800]   and you're gonna be useless.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.240]   Scripture says that you need to speak with love.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.200]   On the flip side, if you speak just with care
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.560]   and sympathy, but you have no truth,
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.440]   then how useful are you?
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.840]   You might make someone momentarily feel better,
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.800]   but you might actually hurt them.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.920]   You might hurt them more than they are now.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.440]   You might give them your pity,
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.680]   but you're not giving them the pity of Christ.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.880]   You're gonna be completely missing the mark.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.520]   And so the maturity and the adulthood that God wants to see
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.040]   is us being able to grow in truth, all in love.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.320]   And he says, "We are to grow up in all aspects,
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.640]   "and to him who is the head, even Christ."
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   Take a moment to think about the kind of thoroughness
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.600]   of maturity, the picture that God has
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.360]   in terms of how he wants us to be sanctified.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.000]   He says, "In all aspects," right?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.920]   Grow up in it all.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.200]   And I want you to think about that.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.560]   Have you truly bought into that mentality?
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.120]   Do you have the attitude that there is going to be
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.960]   a comprehensive growth, where yes,
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.520]   there is no element of your life where you're like,
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.360]   "You know what?
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.200]   "I've always been like this.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.040]   "I'm not gonna change.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.160]   "Come on now, don't say that."
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.080]   If you think, "You know what?
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.120]   "This is too hard for me."
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.800]   Don't say that.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.080]   Because yes, that is just a universal fact.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.400]   So many things are way too hard for us.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.240]   But we have the Lord, and he's saying that his grand desire
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.280]   is that this whole church, all of us,
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.080]   until we all attain to the measure of Christ.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.600]   And in thinking about this, I want to use an example
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.520]   of a difference of attitude.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.960]   Imagine if you signed up for softball.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.160]   You're like, "All right, everybody's all about sports
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.080]   "at this church.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.640]   "I'll play softball."
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.840]   And so you go out to the field and you're swinging around.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.800]   You've hit before, you've played before,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.400]   but you're no pro.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.840]   You're just swinging that bat,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.640]   and some guy comes around and he thinks he's your coach.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.840]   And he's like, "Hey, choke up on that bat.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.240]   "Clearly you haven't practiced enough.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.720]   "You don't have used to the weight of the bat."
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.760]   And you're like, "Whoa," right?
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.560]   And he says, "Hey, your head's all bobbing around.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.120]   "What are you, a bobblehead?
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.320]   "You gotta keep your head straight.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.320]   "Look at that ball and not look away, right?
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.640]   "Eye on the ball the whole way through
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.920]   "until it makes contact."
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.640]   And you're kind of like, "Huh."
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.960]   Pat it up to here.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.720]   And he starts telling you, "Move your feet.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.320]   "How come you don't twist your hips?
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.880]   "You have no power," right?
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.600]   And all of a sudden, he is looking at every aspect
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.640]   of your swing.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.960]   And now you're just annoyed as can be.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.800]   Like, "Hey, man, who told you you were a coach?
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.280]   "Pastor Mark, who is this guy?"
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.240]   Right?
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   You would be so annoyed.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.040]   But instead, if you were this professional athlete
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.480]   playing for the Giants, I don't know who he is,
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.720]   but he wants to know every single aspect of his swing
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.800]   that's not right.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.440]   As a matter of fact, he would hire a batting coach
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.640]   to look at him.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.600]   And if he had a batting coach who wasn't skilled,
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.920]   he'd be like, "Hey, man, that's your job.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.080]   "You need to look at me.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.840]   "Am I moving my head?
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.320]   "Are my feet balanced?
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.960]   "Do I have strength in my head?
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.640]   "You need to tell me 'cause that's your job, man,
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.720]   "'cause he would wanna know."
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.080]   Why?
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.720]   Because he would wanna perfect every single aspect
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.560]   of his swing, because a little bit off
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.280]   means he's not making contact.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.320]   He's not on cue.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.360]   And so for us, likewise, God has a vision for us
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.360]   to be like his son in every single way.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.680]   But if your attitude is just this adversity
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.240]   to people talking about like, "Hey, you need to grow in this."
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.200]   And like, "You know, I'm already doing a good job."
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.360]   And you have this wall up where people can't correct you.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.720]   Know that God's intent is to make sure you're growing
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   in every aspect, in every way, to the full measure of Christ.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.760]   And we have to be bought into that
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.560]   because that's what he wants for all of us collectively.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.120]   Understand that God desires to create
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.040]   this incredible vision for the church.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.280]   And what he says is in verse 16.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.320]   He says, "From whom the whole body, everybody,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.360]   "being fitted together and held together
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.240]   "by what every joint supplies,
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.800]   "according to the proper working of each individual part,
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.240]   "causes the growth of the body
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.600]   "for the building up of itself in love."
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.040]   So I'm not sure if I could even draw a diagram for that,
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.360]   but every single one of us is drawing from the source
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.120]   that is Christ himself.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.640]   We have one spirit, one baptism, one Lord,
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.960]   one faith in our savior that is producing
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   an incredible power for every single one of us
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.440]   and binding us together.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.400]   And we're so one because of that truth of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.000]   And yet individually, Christ has given us gifts
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.600]   and blessed us in such ways that we are participants
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.720]   of this build that he's doing to create this,
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.560]   what?
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.960]   His incredible home, his loving home.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.840]   We're all tied together, interdependent,
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.480]   loving one another, and it would bring such joy
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.880]   to the father to see his home.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.840]   So actively working, so selflessly working,
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.800]   so intentional as he is.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.440]   That's the idea.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.360]   And so I pray, like I pray every single one of us
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.920]   should first get this same vision, like, whoa,
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.280]   like I don't know about everything that needs to happen
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.600]   in this generation and time now,
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.120]   but clearly what I can say that he desires
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.080]   his church to be built.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.360]   And he has a magnificent, beautiful picture
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.000]   where every single piece is doing its part.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.400]   And every single person is growing
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.040]   into the picture of Christ.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.280]   And then collectively, this is a beautiful home
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.800]   reflecting the glories of Christ together.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.320]   And therefore, what a privilege it is for me
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.440]   to help in that build in any way possible.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.800]   We have to have this attitude, like in every single way,
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.720]   I wanna grow, in every single way,
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.200]   I wanted to do the work of service.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.640]   I don't have to do everything,
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.560]   but I wanna do anything for the church.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.240]   And to me, that is my joy.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.080]   I like doing errands for the church.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.720]   I wanna go out there and pick up something
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.480]   and bring it over here and be like, yes, you know.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.000]   I wanna go out there and fix something
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.440]   and be like, I helped fix this part of the church.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.400]   I wanna go out there and meet that guy who's struggling.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.640]   I wanna go out there and meet that guy
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.000]   who's on the outskirt, why?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.480]   Because number one, I know it pleases my heavenly father,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.080]   we're all part of this family.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.440]   But number two, I know we're part of this grand picture
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.360]   that Christ has set.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.960]   He's blessed this church for a reason.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.120]   He's given us the truth
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.960]   and he's building something that reflects
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.040]   essentially his own nature.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.600]   And for me to be able to be a part of that
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.240]   and to say I'm contributing, that's so worthwhile.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.600]   And so I pray that you would also have that mentality.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.920]   Not only are we gonna be doing this together,
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.800]   but thankfully so, because it's then it's to our privilege
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.120]   that we can join in this work of building up the church.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.960]   Let's pray.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.960]   Heavenly father, thank you so much God again.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.080]   What a grace you've given,
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.720]   what mercies you've granted us in Christ.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.720]   And we recognize Lord,
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.000]   the truth and ramification of the fact that you save us
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.360]   is that God you bring us into your home.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.040]   And what's crazy is,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.240]   as you are bringing more and more people into salvation,
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.120]   what glories are given to you.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.440]   But father God, you are building, Lord, your household,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.960]   your people.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.600]   And so God, we thank you for that.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.080]   I do pray that Lord, our church people, that we ourselves,
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.360]   father God, we'd be so inclined
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.760]   to want the same things you want.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.000]   Lord, for us to continue to mimic, to follow
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.040]   and imitate your character,
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.360]   to be more like Christ in every way.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.680]   But what's more father God, to have your intent,
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.400]   Lord, to be the evangelist and to actively desire
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.360]   to build this church, the sharing of the gospel.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.480]   And what's more, that in every way
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.640]   that we can encourage each other and spur each other on,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.600]   God, that we would be able to then
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.840]   build each other up in love.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.280]   And God, joyfully, thankfully,
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.520]   fulfill your design and your intent in this church, Lord.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.760]   We wanna thank you again.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.520]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.880]   Have a great week, everyone.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.720]   Bye.
