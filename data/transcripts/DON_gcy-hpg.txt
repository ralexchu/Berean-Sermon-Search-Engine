[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.360]   (baby crying)
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:47.940]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.280]   I wanna take a brief moment
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.620]   to introduce our brother, Alex Han, to you.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.640]   He's gonna be coming up to share.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.720]   There's probably a good number of you who,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.500]   it's already been some time, so don't know him.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.380]   Alex has been, he came to our church all the way back
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.260]   in 2004 as a college student at UCI.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.260]   And after having spent time in the church,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.180]   growing and learning, he went to the Master's Seminary
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.580]   to get his MDiv.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.660]   And then at Berean, he served in the college ministry.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.180]   He served with the ministry to China
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.900]   and the mission shifts that are happening.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.020]   And then so after some time,
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.980]   they went out with the heart to go do ministry overseas.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.100]   It's already been many years out doing ministry.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.700]   They got involved in working with the IMB.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.620]   And during this time,
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.300]   obviously there are lots of transitions
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.580]   and things that are happening.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.580]   Those things I'll leave for him to share.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.140]   But I wanna take a moment just to warmly welcome him.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.340]   So would you please join me
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.940]   in welcoming him up to the pulpit.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.100]   (audience applauding)
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:55.860]   All right.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.420]   It's an extra step.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.500]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.500]   And it's really great to be back here with you guys.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.900]   I'm really just privileged
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.340]   to be able to worship with you again
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.740]   after probably a year and several months being in Taiwan.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.780]   And so I'm really grateful for this opportunity.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.460]   If you could turn your Bibles to Psalm chapter 47,
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.940]   we're not gonna be just staying in this text,
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.220]   but this is a text I want us to read together
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.940]   and we'll open it to prayer with.
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.140]   And my goal for this evening
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.940]   is just to raise awareness of what's going on overseas,
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.460]   to raise awareness of what's going on
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.220]   in our family's lives,
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.500]   and ways in which we can pray for the churches
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.300]   and for the work being done in China.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.980]   And so we're in Psalm chapter 47.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.260]   I have not yet converted to the NASB.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.100]   I am still in my ESV.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.060]   So we'll be reading from the ESV.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.040]   That's okay.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.740]   Clap your hands, all peoples.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.900]   Shout to God with loud songs of joy.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.860]   For the Lord, the most high, is to be feared,
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.580]   a great king over all the earth.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.420]   He subdued peoples under us and nations under our feet.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.700]   He chose our heritage for us,
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.420]   the pride of Jacob, whom he loves.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.100]   God has gone up with a shout,
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.660]   the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.460]   Sing praises to God, sing praises.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.900]   Sing praises to our king, sing praises.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.180]   For God is the king of all the earth.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.060]   Sing praises with a psalm.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.220]   God reigns over the nations.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.740]   God sits on his holy throne.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.940]   The princes of the peoples gather
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.540]   as the people of the God of Abraham.
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.100]   For the shields of the earth belong to God.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.380]   He is highly exalted.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.220]   Let's pray.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.980]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.100]   for a time for us to gather together,
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.860]   to worship you and to pray,
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.140]   to pray to you, to come to you,
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.740]   to your throne of grace,
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.820]   to lay down before your feet,
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.420]   supplication after supplication, Lord God,
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.980]   of things that are outside of our control,
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.340]   but it's all in your hands.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.140]   And so, Lord God, as we come before you tonight,
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.820]   would you use this time to stir within us
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:41.300]   a desire to see your name proclaimed to the earth,
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.740]   to this world, to the nations, Lord God.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.900]   We understand the situation that we're all in
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.260]   with the pandemic, where we are aware
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.100]   of just all of the troubles we see in our world today,
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.900]   but God, please use this night to shed light,
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.300]   to shed light into seeing how you are working,
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:10.420]   not just here in America, but in the nations.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.860]   And so, Lord God, we pray and ask for your blessing
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.100]   for this time, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:24.140]   I chose this psalm because if you were to ask missionaries
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:30.580]   or oversee workers what drives them,
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.820]   what motivates them, it's typically this image
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.300]   where the nations are worshiping God, right?
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.580]   Where the nations are acknowledging God for who he is,
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.860]   that he is the king of all the earth, right?
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.220]   That is like the biggest hope, the greatest desire
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.860]   for any missionary that you meet.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:57.180]   In fact, the IMB vision, if you were to ask
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.260]   the president of the IMB what the vision is
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.880]   for our organization, you would have to turn
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.120]   to Revelation chapter seven, verse nine.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   So would you turn there with me,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.220]   Revelation chapter seven, verse nine.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.460]   (pages rustling)
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:18.780]   Revelation chapter seven, verse nine says,
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.540]   "After this, I looked and behold a great multitude
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.960]   "that no one could number, from every nation,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.760]   "from all tribes and peoples and languages,
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.880]   "standing before the throne and before the lamb,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.160]   "clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.320]   "and crying out with a loud voice,
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.420]   "Salvation belongs to our God,
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.800]   "who sits on the throne and to the lamb."
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.640]   I'm not much of a vision caster,
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.100]   I don't think that's my gift,
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.240]   but if the Bible is giving me a vision
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.040]   as to what our goal is as a missionary,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.780]   or even as just Christians in general, right?
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.040]   Revelation chapter seven, verse nine and 10 is that,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.160]   is that vision, to see the nations, right?
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.900]   Praising God, praising the lamb.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.080]   Now, again, for many of you,
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.900]   as Pastor Mark has introduced me,
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.420]   we had previously lived in China for three and a half years,
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.240]   we were in Beijing, and we were primarily
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.000]   just doing a lot of evangelizing, discipling,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.440]   just teaching God's word in various contexts.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.480]   And it was after those three and a half years
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.640]   where we decided to come back to America
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.120]   and to join with our current organization,
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.720]   and as a result of that, we moved to Taiwan,
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.860]   and we moved to Taiwan primarily to learn Chinese, right?
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.680]   Because our hope and our desire is to go back into China
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.760]   and to keep serving the Chinese,
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.520]   whether it be preaching the gospel,
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.860]   whether it's bringing God's word to them.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.780]   And so for a long time in our church,
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.660]   we've been doing a lot of ministry in China,
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.380]   it was like the big thing, every summer,
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.940]   going out to go to China,
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.860]   and it's still a great task that needs to be done.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:23.020]   In fact, if we give just a statistical breakdown,
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.420]   1.4 billion people live in China, right?
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.020]   And to give you a little bit more perspective,
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.200]   that's 12% of the world population living in one country.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.620]   And so I know it's hard to get visas to get into China,
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.540]   it's a very arduous process, but once you get that visa,
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:46.300]   wow, man, you have access to 12% of the world's population.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.580]   You can just go there whenever you want.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.680]   In addition to that,
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.100]   because of the large population in China,
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.880]   China is known for their ethnic minorities.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.920]   Right, ethnic minorities,
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.600]   which consists of many different people groups
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.760]   who have never heard who Jesus is,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.600]   who has never heard the name of Jesus.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:15.880]   In fact, more than half of the country's people groups,
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.920]   right, this term people groups refers to like a group
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.080]   of people that have the same culture,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.880]   possibly the same language, right?
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.000]   And so there will be no obstacles to reach to them
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.960]   if you were to speak to them in their native tongue, okay?
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.720]   So in China, more than half of the country's people groups
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.400]   has not yet been reached,
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.000]   nor have active church planning taken place
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.220]   in the last two years.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:52.480]   Though China is considered a big country,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:59.760]   you could see why China is such a big component
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.260]   when we think about Revelation chapter seven, verse nine,
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.320]   when we think about the tribes and the peoples
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.380]   and the language and the nations.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:15.360]   But if you guys have been keeping up with the news,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.800]   then you also know that right now,
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.580]   things happening with or against China
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:27.200]   has been very, very adversarial.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.320]   In fact, this is unprecedented times
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.240]   in terms of the pandemic and heightened security.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.760]   In fact, we're hearing more and more
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   of just overseas workers are being either kicked out
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.060]   or not being allowed to return.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.700]   And we're finding that there is just many, many hurdles
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.160]   in terms of ministry.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.780]   In fact, as you may have already know already,
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.940]   there is just, the government is taking more control
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.260]   over how things are being done.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.060]   In fact, it seems like they want to eliminate
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:16.140]   the diversity that is within China, right?
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.280]   I'm hearing more and more stories of just,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.120]   if you speak this language at school, you're not allowed.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.340]   Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, for example.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.720]   I know you guys think Inner Mongolia, isn't that a country?
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.500]   No, it's a province within China.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.200]   And they used to teach Mongolian in their schools
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.480]   and now they're not, right?
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.040]   As an attempt to control the culture,
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.960]   an attempt to control the ethnic minority there.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.340]   Churches are doing their best in the pandemic.
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.980]   They are trying to meet online like you guys are, right?
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.380]   As many of the US churches are doing as well.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.260]   But they're also being shut down, right?
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.260]   In fact, I heard a story of a church being,
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.900]   service being shut down mid-service.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.960]   Again, this was all done online.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:10.720]   And so we see that we are in a unique time in history.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.180]   In fact, we haven't seen something like this
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.220]   since 1953, when the government,
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.060]   the Chinese government actively expelled overseas workers.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:29.260]   However, we do know that the churches in China
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.060]   have not given up.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.940]   In fact, they are persevering even more so,
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.940]   as I think as any church's DNA would also have
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.280]   this persevering spirit within them.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.000]   Despite the opposition, the churches in China
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.120]   continue to meet for fellowship and ministry.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.920]   In fact, I'm hearing stories of churches still sending out
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.080]   their missionaries within China to reach out
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.200]   to unreached people groups, which for me,
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.360]   that's mind-blowing considering the pandemic,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.520]   considering the heightened security.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.340]   And yet people are still going forward
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.740]   to bring the gospel to those who have not heard.
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.540]   (silence)
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:16.540]   And so the work in China is still going on.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.740]   Just because the pandemic has happened,
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.120]   because there is opposition from the government,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.800]   God's work doesn't stop.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.440]   And that is a tremendous encouragement for all of us.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:34.420]   As for us, as for our family,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.600]   well, I mean, our original goal was to go back
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.140]   into China in August, right?
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.120]   And instead, God shifted our flight plans
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.540]   and we came back to America instead.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.020]   And so we have completed language
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.200]   and we praise God for that.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.680]   It was very, very hard,
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.660]   especially going from a Beijing accent
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.220]   to a Taiwanese accent.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.600]   If you guys are Chinese, you guys know there is a difference
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.580]   and I thought I had my fourth tones down,
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.520]   but I don't know, Taiwan changed me.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.660]   I got a little soft.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:17.020]   I didn't lose my Beijing hwa though, I still had my R's.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:22.200]   And so we're grateful that we finished language
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.080]   and we learned a lot.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.860]   In fact, yeah, I was really honored.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.840]   I was privileged to get an opportunity
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.080]   to preach in Chinese.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.720]   I mean, that was really hard to do.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.080]   It took me about three weeks to recover from all that.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.660]   But to have that opportunity, the pastor just said,
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.060]   "Yeah, I think I understood what you're saying."
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.620]   And I'm like, "Oh, great, keep the bar low."
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:53.220]   But as I said, our original plan was to go back
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.140]   into China in August, but because of the pandemic
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.220]   and other issues outside of control,
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.740]   we are unable to do that.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.540]   And to be honest, as much as the pandemic
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.300]   has affected many of us in so many different ways,
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.140]   the pandemic has also affected our family
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.860]   in terms of where and when, right, where and when.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.980]   And I'll be honest, this is probably like
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.140]   the most unstable time period of our family's history,
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.640]   not knowing where and when we can go.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.460]   I mean, I was originally convicted
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.860]   about China back in 2007, right?
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.420]   And we're now in 2020, 13 years.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.060]   And if you were to ask me, "Hey, Alex, where are you going?"
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.740]   I'll tell you, I'm going to China.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.440]   I don't know where in China, but I'm going to China.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.180]   I knew exactly where I was going
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.940]   'cause I thought I was where I felt God was leading me.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.400]   And this is probably the first time in 13 years
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.200]   where I can honestly say, "I don't know where I'm going."
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.380]   But it's not here, it's not in America.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.620]   It's somewhere out there.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.820]   And I don't know when I'm going, right?
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.200]   And so for our family,
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.100]   this is probably one of the most unstable periods
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.340]   in our time, but that's okay.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.580]   That's okay.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:22.620]   Because the Bible describes the Christian life
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.300]   as being a sojourner, right?
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.300]   Walking through the land, right?
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.200]   And I think it's really cool.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.800]   And it's a really cool position to be in,
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.340]   to be able to experience that
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.040]   and to understand what it means to trust in the Lord,
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.540]   to trust in the Lord's plans.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.860]   'Cause I can develop all the plans I want,
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.220]   but Christ is the one who will establish them.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.460]   And so we're grateful for Berean.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.380]   No one could have predicted this.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.580]   No one could have seen this happening,
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.660]   but we're so thankful for you guys
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:04.020]   for serving us so well as we came back.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.420]   People were asking me,
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.420]   "When you guys came back,
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.900]   "and we're getting furniture and all this stuff."
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:12.380]   And I'm like, "Man, our church came in a clutch."
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.220]   And I'm so grateful for all of you guys who've helped.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:21.100]   So as much as we're uncertain of when and where,
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.180]   one of my prayers for us
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.420]   is that God will continue to raise up workers
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.420]   at Berean Community Church, right?
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.100]   To go over there, right?
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.780]   To go to the nations, to be challenged,
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:42.980]   to be convicted, to see the nations come to know Christ
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.380]   as their Lord and Savior.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:52.740]   Pastor Peter recommended this book to me a long time ago.
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.300]   It's written by James Frazier.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.020]   He was a missionary to the Lisu people in China.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:02.660]   And it's a book called "Mountain Rain."
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.620]   And one of the quotes that continues to strike me
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:12.840]   is that solid, lasting missionary work is done on our knees.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:17.580]   Solid, lasting missionary work is done on our knees.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.260]   While people going out into the field
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:25.060]   may be the physical evidence of missionary work,
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.800]   it's really the power of that work is done through prayer.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:35.500]   And so with that, I would like us to pray for China tonight.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.240]   And I'm gonna have, there's four topics here
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.580]   that I want us to look at.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:45.520]   The first prayer topic is to pray for the spiritual health
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.120]   of the churches in China.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.560]   As you guys can imagine,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:55.240]   the amount of pressure that the leaders would have.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.060]   I mean, I'm pretty sure the leaders in America,
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.160]   the pastors of American churches know this pressure as well.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:06.140]   But the pastors and the leaders of the churches in China
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.820]   need our prayers, need our support.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.680]   Pray that the churches in China
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.700]   to have a growing presence in their gospel witness
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.140]   and in their disciple making, right?
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.940]   A unique opportunity is presented
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.580]   to show how Christ is all.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.940]   Even though opposition is at its strongest,
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.620]   we know that the church will not crumble.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.000]   And so we need to pray for the spiritual health
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.460]   of the churches in China.
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.960]   Secondly, pray for the government.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.780]   Pray for the government, I know, right?
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.640]   They're doing so many atrocities, causing so much trouble.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.580]   I mean, ask my son how the coronavirus started
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.520]   and he'll tell you.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.220]   Nonetheless, those government leaders,
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.780]   the government itself still needs our prayers.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.180]   So we pray for the government leaders
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.780]   that the gospel could be shared with them
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.140]   and that they would believe.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:10.100]   And pray for the government leaders who may be Christians.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.940]   Right, there might be Christians in the government
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.720]   and they're being pressured left and right
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.320]   to comply with the communist values and beliefs.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.400]   Pray for them, pray that they will remain faithful
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   to Christ in the midst of this time period.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.580]   Third, pray for the raising up
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.820]   of overseas workers from China.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.660]   The churches in China are now in a position
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:44.620]   where they can actually send workers overseas, right?
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.680]   There are many countries that a Chinese passport
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.420]   has easy access to, more easier access to
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.780]   than a US passport.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   And so many churches in China are starting to see that
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.120]   and they are trying to raise up workers.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.440]   And so we need to pray that God would raise them up.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.160]   Pray that churches in China will continue
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.520]   to carry the gospel to the unreached.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.880]   Pray that God would raise up believers in China
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.100]   who will carry the gospel to the nations.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:20.480]   And lastly, pray for the raising up of missionaries
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.640]   to go into China.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   I honestly believe that we are now in a shift
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.860]   in terms of what the missionary work looks like.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.820]   You know, I think the traditional way can still work,
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.460]   but I also believe that there needs to be a change.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.340]   There's gonna be requiring a new generation
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.300]   of workers to be sent in, right?
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.060]   It may not be the traditional like,
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.260]   oh, I'm just here as a student,
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.140]   but you're 40 years old, you know?
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.980]   How are you supporting your family of five as a student?
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.960]   I have a really rich uncle.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.800]   Okay.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.740]   You know, that might not fly anymore.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.020]   You know, maybe the next generation
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.600]   have to be working professionals, right?
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.120]   Or college students who could get into China
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.000]   more readily, easily, right?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.560]   To be able to do that work.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.700]   And so those are the four prayer topics
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.560]   that I want us to help please pray for
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.300]   in terms of what's going on overseas.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.340]   And so, yeah, thank you.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:38.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.780]   - All right, so we're gonna take some time
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.140]   to pray for Pastor Alex and his family.
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.700]   And also, along with these topics,
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:52.380]   we're gonna be praying for the Tong family as well.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.700]   They're kind of in a similar situation
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.340]   where they are waiting to go back into China.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.220]   They don't know when either,
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.740]   so they're stationed out actually in Taiwan.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.860]   But again, for security reasons,
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.140]   we're not allowed to share the details,
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.300]   but again, Pastor Alex and his family
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.460]   will not be going directly into China.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.600]   So just kind of continue to pray for that family.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.220]   But one thing I do want to encourage us
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.540]   as we pray for them,
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.740]   and then after I give maybe about three or four minutes
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.860]   to pray, Pastor Mark is gonna come
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.160]   and just kind of wrap up that topic.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.380]   And then afterward, I will come
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.300]   and give another topic to pray,
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.020]   and then another leader will come and wrap that up.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.020]   And we'll do that about five times before we wrap it up.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.220]   But one thing I want to encourage you is,
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.060]   as we pray for these missionaries,
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.460]   sometimes we think that missionaries,
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.680]   because they packed up their bags and went overseas,
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.980]   they're like a special breed of people.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.400]   They're not like the rest of us, right?
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.240]   They struggle like everybody else.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.760]   They're tempted like everybody else.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.920]   They get discouraged like everybody else.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.760]   They have struggles raising their children.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.360]   They have marriage issues.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.900]   They have issues with loneliness.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.320]   They have financial issues just like everybody else.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.620]   The only difference is they chose
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.680]   to make the Great Commission the greatest priority
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.600]   in their life over their personal safety.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.320]   And so they're living out their life faithfully overseas
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.680]   as they're sacrificing many of the things
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.720]   that you and I enjoy here.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.120]   So everything that you and I struggle with,
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.440]   they struggle with.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.560]   So as we pray for them, remember all those things.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.120]   And on top of the things that we wrestle with,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.360]   the lack of accountability, lack of community,
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.400]   that constant moving around, feeling lonely,
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.680]   without direction, sometimes spiritual fatigue,
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.560]   that happens to everybody.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.960]   So I really want you guys to lift up that family.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.560]   You can imagine not knowing where they're gonna go,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.800]   not being in their own homes,
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.200]   having small children in the house.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   And so if you guys can take some time to pray,
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.960]   along with all of these things, pray for that.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.720]   Pray for the Tong family as well.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.400]   And then after about three or four minutes,
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.680]   Pastor Mark is gonna come up
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.720]   and he's going to wrap this part for us, okay?
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.840]   All right, so let's take some time to pray.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:09.540]   (gentle music)

[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:45.140]   >> All right, please join me in prayer.
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:49.420]   Our God, we lift up to you, Pastor Alex and Jen.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.700]   Lift up to you, Harry and Linda.
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:55.580]   And we request, Father God, that you will strengthen them and
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:52:01.060]   allow them, Father God, to be encouraged by your sovereignty.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.180]   Lord, in the midst of circumstances that change and
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:08.340]   situations that feel completely out of their power, we pray, Father God,
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.580]   that their confidence truly would be on you.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:15.100]   We also pray, God, that during this time as they're here stateside,
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.220]   that God, you would build them up.
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:20.140]   Lord, that you would cause them to be strengthened in every way,
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.540]   that especially also in their private devotion and
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.700]   their relationship with you would be all the more bolstered.
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.220]   God, their affection for you, their vision and
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.620]   commitment to serve you in every way possible, will continue to thrive.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:38.820]   And Lord, would you then use them in every way, that they'll temporarily hear,
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.540]   or as they go, that you will cause your light to shine through them.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:46.500]   We also do lift up the China to you,
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:50.380]   particularly the Christians who are there in the churches, that God truly,
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.860]   underneath pressure, persecution, and uneasiness, Lord,
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.260]   you would cause them to be all the more reliant upon you.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.180]   That their dedication to you would grow, and that, God,
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.540]   you would strengthen the churches to disciple people, Father God,
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.820]   to be committed to your truth, to your word, and to your gospel.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.060]   We do pray, Father God, for the government.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:14.780]   God, that although as an entity, it almost feels to us, Father God,
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.340]   so far from what it should be.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:21.620]   And yet, Lord, we recognize that there are, Lord, you work in ways where there are
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:27.300]   officials or individuals who, although in the place of power, rather than rejecting
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.340]   you, rather than rejecting any authority above themselves,
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.500]   God, that you would cause those individuals to submit to you.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.420]   And we pray, Father God, that truly you would bring your truth,
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.620]   you would bring repentance, and God,
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.740]   cause people to be under your love and your salvation.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:49.060]   Again, all the scenario and situations surrounding ministry there,
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.900]   we know, Father God, there is uneasiness and worry, but we lift all those things
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:57.020]   up to you, knowing, God, that your salvation and your truth is so powerful.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.660]   We thank you, Lord, in Christ, and we pray.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.300]   Amen.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:05.940]   - We're going to be praying for India.
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:09.100]   And again, I posted up, I think, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.420]   the latest update when we got...
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:15.580]   I did get an email from Pastor Sake about the ministry that they're engaged in.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.940]   And so, they are...
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:21.660]   Because of transportation, the COVID situation is much harsher than here.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.580]   And so, they have to sometimes walk into the villages.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.020]   They can only go to the main roads.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:30.780]   And so, a lot of the smaller rickshaws that they use to get into villages are
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:31.500]   not available.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.420]   So, they're actually walking, you know, tens and, you know, I mean, long time.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.300]   If you've been to those villages, you know how long it takes to get
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.540]   into these villages.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.500]   So, they are actively still doing ministry, but just much harder.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.580]   And the persecution is obviously increasing.
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:52.380]   And so, the last update I gave, you know, they came into our training center and
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.420]   basically targeted a couple of our pastors, and they were beaten,
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:56.540]   and they had leg injuries.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:00.020]   And so, they said it's getting better, but again, they're not fully healed.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.700]   But in the midst of that, they're taking the gospel to the villages.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:08.340]   So, you know, as we are challenged, you know, like, again, our primary concern
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.100]   that we want to make sure that our children are saved, we want to make sure
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.780]   that we're healthy, that we have our jobs, and those are our constant concerns.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:19.380]   But I think, you know, true fellowship is to be able to suffer with those suffer and
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.980]   rejoice with those who are rejoicing.
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:25.420]   And so, let's take some time to pray as if those are our brothers and our sisters,
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:29.780]   our uncles, our fathers, and not to pray like those people over there,
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:32.780]   but these are people that, again, that we are doing ministry with.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:38.100]   So, let's really, really, like, have a spirit of praying with urgency for them,
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.500]   for what God is doing.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:44.220]   So, I want to read a passage, and then I want you to pray in these lines.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.780]   Paul asked for prayer.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.580]   Apostle Paul, 2 Thessalonians 3, 1, 2, 3, says, "Finally, brethren,
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:54.300]   pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified,
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:59.780]   just as it did also with you, and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men,
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:03.980]   for not all have faith, but the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.580]   protect you from the evil one."
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:09.820]   Let's pray along these lines that there will be a sense of urgency,
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:13.540]   not only in them, but in us, to spread the gospel, and that in the midst of spreading
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:17.100]   this gospel, that God would protect them so that they can do this more rapidly.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.500]   So, let's take some time to pray, and then Elder James is going to come up in about
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.100]   four minutes, and he's going to wrap us up in prayer for that.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.140]   Okay? Let's pray.

[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.140]   All right, let's pray.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:23.140]   Father, our deep desire, Lord, is that your word would be honored.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:31.140]   We receive so much joy, Lord, when we see someone who is lost come to faith.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:38.140]   And so, Lord, it is heartbreaking right now, Lord, to see so many people confused.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:43.140]   But, Lord, even now, we know very well that you are actively at work,
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.140]   that even now, Lord, many are coming to you.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.140]   Lord, as we consider our brothers and sisters in India,
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:57.140]   how even before the pandemic, Lord, their life was not easy.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:03.140]   And their life has only gotten much more difficult since the start of this pandemic.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:08.140]   But, Lord, it would appear that their faith has grown even stronger,
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:15.140]   that despite situational difficulties, Lord, that they are moving forward,
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:20.140]   advancing the gospel, even with long journeys, Lord,
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:26.140]   where their feet are sore and they're blistered.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:32.140]   But all they could think about, Lord, is what you're going to do in these other villages.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.140]   We thank you so much for them, Lord.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:40.140]   We thank you for just their love for you and how, Lord,
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:51.140]   despite the 33 million gods that are worshipped in some way, shape, or form in India,
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:55.140]   Lord, that they know the true God.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:02.140]   And so, Lord, as they continue, we pray, Lord, that even though the darkness is thick,
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:09.140]   that as the light is just shining brightly in their lives, in their speech,
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:17.140]   that your word would cut many people, that it would bring many to repentance, Father.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:24.140]   And that as they come to repentance, that you will continue to sanctify these new believers,
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:31.140]   raising up more workers, Lord, and just multiplying faithful believers in that region.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:39.140]   We know, Lord, that many of the families are suffering directly because of their faith in you.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.140]   Would you comfort them?
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:46.140]   Would you continue to remind them that this life is short
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:53.140]   and that the sufferings of this life are not worthy to even be compared to the glory that is going to be revealed?
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:03:02.140]   And that one day, very soon, Lord, that this life will seem almost like a forgotten bad dream,
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.140]   because we will be with you forever.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.140]   Thank you so much for what you're doing.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.140]   We thank you in advance for what you will do.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:13.140]   We pray, it seems, in your name, your son. Amen.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:17.140]   Okay, before I get to the next topic, one of the things that I really want to encourage you,
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   when you pray, a casual prayer is not answered.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:26.140]   Okay? And let me make that crystal clear.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:31.140]   A casual prayer where you come before God nonchalantly with your mind wandering,
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.140]   you know, because of our casual attitude toward God,
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:41.140]   like first and foremost when we come to God, we need to recognize who it is that we are talking to.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.140]   He's not it. He's not something from a distance.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:49.140]   So sometimes the way we sit, our posture, you know, it's kind of like,
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.140]   "God, you know, can you answer my prayer?"
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:56.140]   Like God says, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart."
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.140]   So the casual prayer is not a prayer.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:04.140]   A prayer is recognizing, first and foremost, who it is that we are talking to.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:13.140]   Right? And so when we pray, if you notice that your posture isn't consistent with who you are talking to,
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:18.140]   and I'm not saying that we need to get on our knees and we need to be yelling out, and I'm not saying that,
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:22.140]   is your attitude casual in the way that you pray?
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.140]   Is there a sense of urgency?
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:29.140]   We can't pray for urgency for the gospel to spread and pray in such a way where it doesn't reflect,
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:33.140]   like we don't really care whether he answers his prayer or not.
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:36.140]   So I want to encourage you again to learn how to pray.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:41.140]   If you have a hard time praying, that you need to, maybe you need to kind of like,
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:47.140]   to take a step back and ask, "Have I really determined to pray tonight?
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:53.140]   Have I determined to come to the Lord and to cry out to him for these prayers?"
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:59.140]   And so along with that, again, this is just an encouragement to make sure that we are praying
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:05.140]   with the attitude that's consistent with what it is that we're praying about and who it is that we are praying to.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.140]   I want to take some time to pray for gospel opportunities.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:13.140]   Right now, as you guys know, because of all the stuff that's going on,
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:20.140]   the COVID, the marching, the political divide, because of all the stuff that's going on,
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:24.140]   one of two things are happening to everybody.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:30.140]   Either you are being sobered by what's going on and there's a kind of a turning in your heart
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.140]   that you really need to cling to God.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:37.140]   And so it's causing you to long for fellowship, long to be in the word,
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:42.140]   long to participate in what's going on, or you're drifting.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:47.140]   You probably have already drifted because the tide is strong.
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:52.140]   And so your heart has become callous, you know, like whether you're there or not,
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.140]   it's just kind of like, "Ah, hopefully things will get back to normal."
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   And so, again, all the more why we need to be absolutely anchored to Christ.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:07.140]   Right? And so you'll notice if you are not spiritually sober,
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:13.140]   every other thing that you're going to be watching on TV or the Internet is probably upsetting you.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:17.140]   You're getting triggered by somebody saying something that you don't agree with.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:22.140]   And there's this growing sense of like discontent of what's going on.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:27.140]   So we really need to protect our heart that that's not our primary thought.
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:30.140]   But along with that, if you're staying spiritually sober,
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:34.140]   you'll notice that there is a growing and hungering and thirsting
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:38.140]   for something more than this world from the non-Christian world.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:42.140]   So there are more people interested, and it's much easier to share the gospel.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.140]   So if you have people around you that you've been praying for,
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:50.140]   even casually been praying for, my bet is it'll be much easier for you to share the gospel
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:54.140]   with your coworkers, with your family, friends, you know, your neighbors,
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:57.140]   than it's probably ever been.
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:01.140]   And so we really need to stay spiritually sober, right?
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:05.140]   So that what God is doing behind the scene, that we just don't let it pass.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:09.140]   That we're not hoping that the world would go back to normal,
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:14.140]   but that when he stirs things up, it's an opportunity for us to take advantage of that, right?
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:19.140]   And so Colossians 4, 2-4, it says, "Devote yourselves to prayer,
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.140]   keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving,
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.140]   praying at the same time for us as well,
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:29.140]   that God will open up to us a door for the Word,
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:33.140]   so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned,
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:36.140]   that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak."
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:39.140]   So let's take some time to make a list in our head,
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:43.140]   who is it around me that I have an opportunity to share the gospel with,
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:47.140]   and to pray for them. Again, pray with them fervently, with urgency.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:52.140]   Don't pray for the salvation of somebody that you love in a casual manner, right?
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.140]   Pray consistently with what you are praying for,
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:59.140]   for the salvation of their souls, that they would not be judged.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:02.140]   And so let's pray with that urgency, pray for opportunity,
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.140]   and when God does give you the opportunity,
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:08.140]   that you would have the boldness to be able to share the gospel with them,
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.140]   graciously, but clearly.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.140]   So let's take some time to pray for that,
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:16.140]   and Elder Phillip is going to wrap us up in about four minutes.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.140]   Let's pray.

[01:12:50.140 --> 01:13:00.140]   [music]
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:03.140]   [music]
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:14.140]   Dear Heavenly Father, I just want to thank you, Lord God,
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.140]   as we're gathering here, Lord, to pray.
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:25.140]   And what we're praying for is so important.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.140]   Father, I pray
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:33.140]   for forgiveness, Lord,
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:37.140]   for being hardened, Lord God,
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:40.140]   for not praying, Lord,
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:43.140]   being so nonchalant,
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.140]   walking in existing, Lord God,
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:49.140]   and just so worried about our own concerns, Father,
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.140]   when there are those around us who for eternity will be in hell.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.140]   They don't know you, Father God.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:59.140]   And Lord, it's hard to see, Lord, when we see with fleshly eyes,
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.140]   but give us spiritual eyes, Lord,
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.140]   as Christ had compassion,
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.140]   for he knew what the future was going to be, Father.
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:11.140]   And Lord God, we thank you for the Gospel,
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.140]   for what Christ did on the cross, Lord God,
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:17.140]   and gave us a ministry to the lost, Father.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.140]   And what an amazing picture it is when we see,
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:23.140]   Lord, in Revelations, there will come a day, Lord God,
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.140]   whether we speak or not,
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.140]   that every people group,
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:30.140]   people of all nations, Father God,
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.140]   will be gathered together,
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:36.140]   countless, praising you, glorifying you, Father God.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:39.140]   We pray, Father, that among them is named
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:43.140]   our family members, our coworkers,
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.140]   our friends, the people that are around us, Lord God,
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:49.140]   that because--not because of what we said,
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.140]   but because you desire to use us
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:55.140]   to speak the Gospel.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:59.140]   So I pray, Father God, that you cause us first to pray.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:02.140]   Cause us to pray for our own hearts to be solved,
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.140]   so that we might see the need
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:08.140]   and the bankrupt state that this world is in, Father.
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.140]   Even though people might have everything
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.140]   in a worldly sense, Father God,
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.140]   we know that they are suffering
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.140]   because without Christ, without God in their life,
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.140]   they have no future,
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.140]   they have no help, Father God.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.140]   That we pray, Father, that first of all,
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:26.140]   you would convict us, Lord,
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.140]   the need, Father, to preach the Gospel.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:31.140]   Give us the boldness to speak, Father.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.140]   Break us, Lord God, so that we might see
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:37.140]   the sinfulness and the brokenness of this world.
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:40.140]   And...
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:43.140]   And the greatness of your Gospel.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:46.140]   So we pray, Father God,
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.140]   it would help us to be the light,
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.140]   be the ambassador that you have called us to be, Father.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:55.140]   And forgive us, Lord God, for being...
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:58.140]   (sniffles)
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.140]   So negligent.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:02.140]   So pray, Father, that you would cause
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.140]   and raise up your believers,
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.140]   your Bereans, Father God, to be that voice.
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.140]   Give us the courage and the boldness
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:13.140]   and the conviction that the Gospel is needed.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.140]   We pray for open doors.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:18.140]   We pray, Lord God, that we would be in our knees
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.140]   and we would pray that we will see, Father,
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.140]   and we will have a vision, Lord God,
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:27.140]   and when that day comes, and we will say, "Yes, Lord.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:29.140]   "Yes, the people that we are around, Lord,
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:32.140]   "can join us in praising you and glorifying you."
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.140]   So we thank you, Father God.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.140]   And, Lord, let--let--pray that this prayer,
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:41.140]   that it doesn't end here, Father,
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:43.140]   that it would continue,
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.140]   that we need the working of your Holy Spirit to convict us.
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.140]   There's nothing more important
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.140]   than what we are doing right now.
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:55.140]   Pray, Lord, if we are not moved right now,
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.140]   Lord God, help us so that we might pray.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:04.140]   So we thank you for a day like this.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:06.140]   We thank you for times like this, Lord God.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.140]   We can pray together and feel your presence
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:13.140]   and see your word, Lord God, so mightily and strong.
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:16.140]   So thank you, Heavenly Father, and be with us, Lord God.
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:20.140]   May we continue to pray, continue to be moved,
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:24.140]   and continue to be obedient, Lord God, to your calling.
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:27.140]   I pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.140]   - Next, we're gonna take some time to pray
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:33.140]   for our college ministry
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.140]   because this is a welcome week that's coming,
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.140]   and so they have plans to reach out,
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.140]   and obviously, with all the different circumstances.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.140]   So I asked Pastor Nate to kind of explain what they're doing
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.140]   so we can pray more effectively for them.
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:50.140]   - Okay, so welcome week is coming up for college,
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.140]   and it is probably the strangest welcome week on record for us
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.140]   because of the pandemic.
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.140]   We don't know who's going to be around,
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.140]   and this coming week, all week long,
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:05.140]   we're gonna be on the campuses, just two.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:08.140]   We're gonna be at UCI, and we're gonna be at Chapman,
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:10.140]   going around, trying to see if there are people
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:12.140]   that we can reach out to.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:17.140]   And so there are a lot of things that we can be praying for,
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.140]   but with the welcome week,
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:21.140]   and especially coming off a prayer topic
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:23.140]   like we just prayed for,
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:26.140]   would you pray for our college students?
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:29.140]   I don't know if it's gonna be a redundant prayer,
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:31.140]   but if you can remember,
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.140]   and that harvest really is plentiful,
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.140]   and these campuses are a battleground.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.140]   It's a war zone.
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:42.140]   There's so much battle for supremacy in these places,
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.140]   and our students are right there.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:47.140]   They're right in the middle of that.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:50.140]   For many of us who are out of that,
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:53.140]   we've kind of established these are our jobs.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.140]   I'm married, we have children.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:59.140]   We're looking forward to different things like that,
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.140]   but for many of these students,
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.140]   actually, they're right there in the middle of it,
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.140]   and they need our prayers.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.140]   These college students of ours,
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:12.140]   there's the enemy that really wants to sift them
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.140]   and to be there and to sow discord,
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.140]   to sow confusion,
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.140]   so if we could pray for in them
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:21.140]   a steadiness that comes,
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.140]   an anchoring on Christ,
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:25.140]   a biblical worldview,
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.140]   and a love for the Lord above all things.
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:33.140]   We have about half, a little less than half of our students
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.140]   also who are away,
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:37.140]   who aren't going to be with us physically,
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.140]   but who've been joining us all the way back since March,
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:43.140]   virtually, on both Fridays, Sundays,
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.140]   and different things that we've been doing,
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:48.140]   but they are very much in need of our prayers as well.
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.140]   It's hard to be so far,
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.140]   and so if you could pray specifically for the students
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:55.140]   who are part of our ministry,
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:58.140]   but who are very removed from us.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.140]   There are a lot of temptations that come,
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:04.140]   and there's a great temptation to disengage
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:08.140]   with, and there's a group here that are beginning to engage,
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.140]   and it feels very different,
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.140]   like being here and being away,
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:15.140]   and so the church being a gathering of believers,
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:19.140]   we've been spending a lot of time praying for those students,
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.140]   so if the whole church could join us in prayer
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.140]   for those students specifically,
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.140]   we are in need of much of it.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:29.140]   We don't want to be a college ministry
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.140]   that's removed from the rest of the church here.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:36.140]   They are our future.
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.140]   I don't mean to sound cheesy with that,
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:40.140]   but they really are the future.
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:43.140]   We want them to be men and women who are being formed
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.140]   and shaped right now for kingdom cause,
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:49.140]   so if we could pray for them, I'll be back to pray.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:52.140]   Close.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.140]   All right, let's pray,
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:59.140]   and then Pastor Nate will come and wrap us up, okay?

[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.360]   what a bold prayer that we can pray,
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.360]   asking you to help them.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:35.360]   Father, who are we, God, and who are these students?
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.360]   Father, we thank you that you care,
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.360]   that you love your people.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.360]   Father, you desire to grow and to empower and to embolden.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.360]   Father, you are a transcendent God,

[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   and God, we ask you, Lord, to be close to these college students.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.360]   Oh, Father, help them to feel your nearness.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.360]   Help them not to just go into your word and engage it as they
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:11.360]   would another textbook and a long line of books that they have.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:17.360]   Oh, Father, that they would be able to see clearly.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.360]   Lord, the enemy wants them.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.360]   Oh, Father, the world is loud in their ears,
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.360]   and there is a temptation, God, to just go along,
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:35.360]   or Father, maybe to disengage the world altogether and to hide at church.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:38.360]   Father, maybe there is the temptation of just looking into their own future
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.360]   and desiring to just have a piece of this world,
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.360]   and just live life until the end.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.360]   But God, I pray that these college students would be so much more.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.360]   Lord, would you fill them with your spirit?
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.360]   Would you remind them of who they are?
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.360]   Oh, Father, would you save each of them,
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.360]   and God, draw them into your kingdom.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.360]   Open their eyes, not just to see their own depravity,
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.360]   but everything around them.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.360]   Father, that they may be men and women who are strong,
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.360]   who are courageous, who hold the line,
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   who are able to discern right from wrong,
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.360]   who look different than the culture and the friends and the world around them.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:29.360]   Father, help them to be not a pleaser of man, but a God-pleaser.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.360]   Father, help them to find satisfaction not in the things of this world,
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.360]   but in the things that only you can provide.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.360]   And at the end, God, that they would be so satisfied in you alone.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   God, this school year is going to be weird.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360]   It's a strange time for them,
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360]   and there is a temptation to grow inward in these things,
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:50.360]   but I pray, God, that you do great things for your name through this group.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.360]   And Father, I pray, Lord, that even this coming week,
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360]   that you'd give great opportunity,
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.360]   and that we would not shrink back at those opportunities,
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.360]   but our college ministry would go into UCI,
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   and Chapman specifically, to be bold.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   And Father, we pray that you'd be, even now,
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   making fertile ground, individuals that we would come across,
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.360]   that by the light that these college students are shining,
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.360]   they may come to know Christ, all God, to multiply your glory in this world.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360]   So Father, we pray for this school year.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.360]   God, we entrust it all to you, though we can't see, you know everything.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.360]   And so we trust in you, and we're so grateful, God,
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.360]   that you truly, indeed, are a good God.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.360]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.360]   Okay, so fifth and final thing that we want to pray for
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:41.360]   before we ask the praise team to come back up and lead us in closing.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.360]   I want to read Ephesians 6, 10 through 18.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:46.360]   I'm just going to read the beginning and the last part of it.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:50.360]   It says, "Finally, be strong in the Lord in the strength of his might.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.360]   Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.360]   against the schemes of the devil.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.360]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.360]   but against the rulers, against the powers,
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.360]   against the world forces of this darkness,
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.360]   against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:11.360]   With all prayer and petition," verse 18, "pray at all times in the Spirit,
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.360]   and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.360]   and petition for all the saints."
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   If with all that has been going on,
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   that you have not given thought to the spiritual battle,
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.360]   the demonic work that's going on,
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.360]   that may already be an indicator that spiritually you've just kind of drifted.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:39.360]   The Bible tells us in Ephesians to recognize that our real struggle
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.360]   is not against flesh and blood.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   It's not about politics.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.360]   It's not about what we see physically.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.360]   They said there's a spiritual battle going on.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:52.360]   There's satanic work that's happening right now.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.360]   There's a satanic work that's happening at a global level.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.360]   There's satanic work that's happening at a national level.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:01.360]   There's satanic work happening in the churches.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:05.360]   And there's satanic work happening particularly in your life.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:11.360]   And if we're not sober, all that is going on at the end of it,
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.360]   we can find ourselves so drifted far away from God
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.360]   and that everything that Satan has been doing in the end,
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.360]   the end product is that we become numb.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.360]   The churches become divided.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.360]   We've jumped into causes that we don't fully understand.
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.360]   And in the end, Satan's work has been completed.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.360]   Right now, what's going on?
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:36.360]   As you guys know, if you've been paying attention,
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.360]   Breonna Taylor's verdict came out yesterday.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.360]   So you have a part of community saying that that was unjust.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.360]   You have another part saying that it was completely just.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.360]   Right now, again, and I don't say this flippantly,
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:57.360]   there is clear satanic work in the midst of all of this.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:01.360]   No matter what your opinion is, if you don't stay sober
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.360]   and you don't test the spirits,
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.360]   that you don't examine the Word of God,
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.360]   and you don't test the information that you're getting,
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.360]   you're going to easily be consumed.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:16.360]   Whatever your leaning is, Satan is going to use that
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   to take you to whatever direction he wants to take you.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:23.360]   So we must stay sober.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.360]   We're going to try to address this in a more specific way going forward
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.360]   because we've addressed it in the very beginning.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.360]   We wanted to make sure that our church kind of stays intact
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:37.360]   and we keep our eyes on the Word of God
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.360]   and make sure that we're not going to be tossed back and forth.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:43.360]   Since then, so much more has happened,
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   and the tender is already laid.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:50.360]   What's happening now is just a precursor of what we foresee happening
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.360]   in the coming months.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.360]   And so the churches have already been divided.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:58.360]   You have men of God that have a godly reputation
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:02.360]   who are speaking one way very powerfully, very convicted,
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:07.360]   and then you have other people on the other side speaking also with conviction.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.360]   We have our thoughts, and we are going to, at some point,
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.360]   make it more clear and point out very specific things
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.360]   that we have seen in the last month,
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.360]   things that we've read, things that we've seen,
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.360]   a lot of things that we've seen, again, about the BLM movement,
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   about the critical race theories.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.360]   These are things that we've been examining and we've been talking about,
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:33.360]   but there is very deeply embedded satanic work in these things.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:38.360]   I'm not saying that everybody who has jumped on this has that bent,
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:42.360]   but there is clear satanic work that is embedded in all of this stuff.
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.360]   And so I want to make that very clear.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.360]   And I'm not asking you to just take my word for it.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.360]   We're asking you all the more to examine everything,
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.360]   to test everything, to test the spirits,
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:58.360]   that is this from God, or is this the work of our enemy
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.360]   trying to destroy the church?
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.360]   And so we really need to be sober.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:08.360]   So there is a national work, there is an international work that's being done,
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:12.360]   but personally, when you pray,
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:17.360]   have you been aware that we have an enemy,
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:20.360]   a roaring lion seeking someone to devour,
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.360]   and that someone is you, it's me.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.360]   They don't want Christians to be glorifying God.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.360]   They don't want us to be dedicated in building up the church and preaching the gospel.
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.360]   So have you been aware that there is an enemy actively attacking you?
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.360]   And so if you have not been, we need to pray.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.360]   We need to pray, right? He says to make sure.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.360]   When he said this in the book of Ephesians,
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.360]   everything that you and I are experiencing, the division in the church,
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.360]   the heavy persecution, hostility toward the spreading of the gospel,
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.360]   false gospel, heresy, all of these things were also true in the first century,
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.360]   but more intense.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.360]   So he was warning the church not to get caught up thinking that if you
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:05.360]   had enough people, if you had the right strategy,
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.360]   if you put your effort into this, he would say, "No, all of these things are good,
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.360]   but don't forget that the real struggle is not against flesh and blood."
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.360]   And that's why he says you have to pray.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.360]   You have to be in the Word, and you have to pray.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:24.360]   You have to pray with urgency.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:30.360]   And so again, I'm going to think beyond just tonight.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.360]   I have a hard time praying at my house, so I just kind of come,
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.360]   break away, and make sure I take some time to pray in my office in the morning
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:40.360]   or in the afternoon.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:43.360]   When you're praying, where are you praying?
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:46.360]   When are you praying? Are you praying deliberately?
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:51.360]   Or are you praying just kind of as things come by?
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.360]   And so I think if there's any time where there is a dire need for us
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:00.360]   to really be committed to pray, it's now, not just this evening.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.360]   This evening is to remind us that we need to pray.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:08.360]   So let me read this passage one more time, and then let's take some time to pray.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:13.360]   Then after that, I'll pray, and then we'll ask that praise team to come back
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:16.360]   and we'll wrap it up for us.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.360]   "With all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit,
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.360]   and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:25.360]   and petition for all the saints."
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.360]   So let's take some time to pray, and then I'll wrap us up.

[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:39.360]   Father, we pray for spiritual soberness.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.360]   We pray, Father God, that you'd open our eyes,
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:47.360]   that the spiritual reality would become more real to us,
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.360]   that we would not walk by sight, but walk by faith.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.360]   Lord, help us to number our days,
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:59.360]   to know that all that we are tempted to have,
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:02.360]   all the comfort and safety, Lord God,
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.360]   that we desire so much,
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.360]   Lord, in light of eternity, Lord, would truly become rubbish.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:14.360]   Help us to know, Father God, that we are not living in peace times,
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:18.360]   but that there's always been a spiritual battle.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.360]   We thank you, Father God, with COVID,
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.360]   with the divisions in this country.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.360]   We pray, Father God, for the unrest, Lord, that we see all around us,
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:36.360]   that in the midst of all of this, we thank you, Father God, for opening our eyes,
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.360]   reminding us, Lord, that in the spiritual realm,
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.360]   that the battle is much stronger
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:48.360]   and is much more fervent, Lord God, than we can imagine.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:55.360]   Lord God, we pray that you would help us to engage in prayer,
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:59.360]   engage spiritually, engage in prayer,
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.360]   engage spiritually, Lord God, not with our might,
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.360]   not with our intellect, not simply with our politics,
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.360]   but spiritually help us, Lord God, to put on the full armor of God.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.360]   Help us to know what we believe, what we confess,
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:18.360]   that in season and out of season, Lord, that we would be ready
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:22.360]   to make defense of what it is that we profess.
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:28.360]   Help us, Lord God, not to drift along from week to week,
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:32.360]   being entangled with things that ultimately don't matter.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:37.360]   Help us, Lord God, to ache for those who are lost.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   Help us, Lord, to battle for souls, to see them come to Christ.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:50.360]   Help us, Lord God, as a church, to learn what it means to follow Jesus Christ.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.360]   Lord, I pray that you would stir in us a sense of urgency,
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:59.360]   urgency, Lord God, that our time here is short,
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:05.360]   that tomorrow is not promised, that we will live today, Father God,
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.360]   for the things that count for eternity.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:13.360]   Help us not to live day to day, week to week, month to month in regret,
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.360]   but to really be poured out in things, Lord God,
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.360]   so that when the time comes for you to call us,
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:26.360]   that we would eagerly await for you to say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant."
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:31.360]   So I pray, whether we are young or whether we are older in age,
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   that you would help us, Lord God, to live with perspective,
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.360]   that our faith would not simply be wishful thinking,
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.360]   but the reality of which we base all that we pursue.
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:48.360]   Help us, Lord God, to be spiritually engaged with you,
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:53.360]   that we would not run, that we would not watch from a distance.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.360]   Help us, Lord God, to know what you are doing and to trust you with all our hearts.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.360]   And as the world runs to safety,
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:07.360]   that knowing, Father God, that our eternity is secure,
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:11.360]   that we would live our lives, Lord God, courageously for your kingdom.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:15.360]   So, Lord, we pray for revival in our generation,
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.360]   revival in our church, revival in our families.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.360]   Lord, we don't have the strength, we don't have the discipline.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:27.360]   Lord, sometimes we don't even have the will.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.360]   So we pray, Father God, that you would be merciful to us.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.360]   Lord, as we pray, Father God, that you would help us to commit to pray,
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:41.360]   to be devoted to pray, Lord, that we would recognize how helpless we are without you.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.360]   And so we ask, Lord, that what we do tonight and what we did tonight, Lord,
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.360]   would serve as a reminder to us when we go home,
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.360]   that this is something that we must do in private,
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:56.360]   that as we wrestle together, Lord God, corporately,
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:00.360]   that it would strengthen us to wrestle privately.
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:05.360]   Lord, we pray for our missionaries, we pray for Pastor Alex, Lord God,
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.360]   and his family especially as they are here.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.360]   I pray that you would give them the rest that they need.
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:14.360]   But I pray, Father God, that though they are resting,
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.360]   I pray that a sense of urgency in their hearts would not be squashed,
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.360]   but that a greater sense of love for you, greater sense of love for the lost,
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.360]   that even as they are waiting, Father God, for their next assignment,
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:32.360]   that you would allow them to have plenty of opportunities here, Lord God,
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.360]   to share the gospel and bear much fruit.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:39.360]   And so we pray for your grace for them, we pray for grace, Lord God, for our church.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.360]   And again, Father God, for our college ministry,
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.360]   as many souls will be coming into town, Lord, even in this difficult situation,
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:50.360]   I pray, Father God, that you would cause them to be fruitful,
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.360]   prayerful, and kingdom-minded in all things.
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:58.360]   So we just want to thank you.
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.360]   We love you.
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.360]   We want to love you more.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.360]   Help us, Father God.
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.360]   Help us draw near to you with sincerity.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:16.360]   Help us, Lord God, to worship you genuinely in spirit and in truth,
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:21.360]   that we would not go from Sunday to Sunday, Father God,
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:26.360]   without giving too much thought of what it is that we're doing.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.360]   Help us to live as if you are coming tomorrow.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.360]   We thank you, Father God.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:36.360]   May Christ's name be exalted through us.
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
