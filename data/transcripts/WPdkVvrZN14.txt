[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.180]   Welcome to Praise and Prayer.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.560]   This is something we do once a month or so,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.820]   and it's cool because we can all gather together
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.480]   as a church, and I'm sure people are still tuning in
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.820]   virtually here, and our hope is that we become
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.060]   more and more of a prayerful church,
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.500]   a one who comes before our God to request to Him
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.580]   different things, but in a very personal, intimate way
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.700]   that we can actually pray to Him.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.460]   And so before we begin, I'll pray for the night,
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.420]   and then we're gonna be singing a few songs.
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.980]   Would you bow your heads with me?
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.080]   Heavenly Father, we thank You.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.080]   After long weeks, we get to the end on these Fridays,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.540]   and God, sometimes we're just so tired.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.360]   But Lord, we know where our rest is,
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.600]   and God's right here in prayer,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.040]   and in the throne room of grace where we can come
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.640]   to our Father and talk with You.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.960]   Father, would You strengthen us?
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.500]   Would You help us, God, not to see prayer as duty?
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.920]   Would You help it to be an intimate affair,
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.280]   and Father, something that we love to do?
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.240]   God, would You help us to exercise
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.600]   this discipline in our lives?
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.000]   Would You help us to grow and to love You
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.440]   and others more through it?
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.900]   And God, most of all, would You cause us
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.100]   to be a prayerful church that we might understand
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.440]   that all things are in Your hands and not in ours?
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.080]   So Lord, as we sing these songs to You,
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.880]   would You be honored and worshiped?
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   Church family, why don't we all stand together for worship?

[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.520]   Okay, again, welcome back.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.340]   These prayer nights are very special
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.700]   because when we think about prayer,
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.920]   it could be as simple as us just sending these things
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.700]   to you via a Word document,
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.420]   and then you can just pray at home by yourself.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.700]   But I love these nights because there's something
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.620]   about us knowing that we're all praying together,
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.380]   and there is a unity of heart and mind and spirit
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.140]   in prayer that I think is more than worth the drive
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.720]   that you make here to come together,
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.480]   to pray together for these topics.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.880]   And so I hope that it's an enjoyable thing.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.360]   As hard as it is, I hope that we leave very encouraged
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.260]   and refreshed because in prayer,
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.480]   there is a great uniting of hearts
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.520]   that I think happens in the midst of it.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.040]   So same thing as what we've been doing,
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.880]   we're gonna be giving you a lot of time tonight,
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.340]   a good chunk of time kind of undisturbed for you to pray.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.540]   But before that, just a quick word.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.620]   When we think about prayer
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.920]   and when we think about what we're doing here,
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.060]   there are many facets of prayer
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.180]   that we can kind of wiggle around
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.460]   and try to see what angle our prayer's supposed to be.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.200]   Tonight, I wanted to concentrate on just one thing
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.260]   that I think is very easy for us to forget
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.940]   when it comes to prayer.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.520]   And what that is is who we're praying to.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.400]   Now, I know that should be an obvious thing
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.320]   and I know that we do keep God in mind,
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.300]   but what I mean by that is when we pray
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.920]   and we come before God,
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.800]   do we take the time to honestly and deeply
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   and even very sharply evaluate who God is
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.600]   and who this God is that we're praying to?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.220]   We have many things that we want to pray for.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.260]   I think right now, if I asked you,
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.520]   is there something that you wanted to pray for tonight,
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.300]   I think there would be a lot.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.780]   I think there are a lot of things going on in our lives.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.380]   I think there are a lot of people in our lives
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.940]   that are struggling and going through difficulties
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.780]   and in sin.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.140]   I think there's a lot that we need to let go of,
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.700]   that we need to confess for ourselves.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.180]   But before that, our concentration on who God is,
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.920]   knowing who it is that we're talking to
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.120]   other than just kind of the general,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.800]   like, oh, it's the God, the sovereign God,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.520]   to take a quick step back and remember it
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.820]   and know him and see him in a very crisp way.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:07.600]   When you talk to someone, you're very aware of who they are.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.000]   And when you're talking to someone
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.840]   and especially if you have requests for someone,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.680]   who they are tends to matter.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.000]   So this past Sunday, I was very challenged
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.080]   by the Sunday sermon and this idea of God's love
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.220]   and this idea of what it means that he's our father.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.040]   When we're talking to someone,
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.960]   especially if it's our father,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.600]   who they are is going to start to dictate
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   what we ask for, how we approach, and what they do.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.460]   So for example, if for a living,
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.320]   they do something very specific,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.280]   then we're gonna be very quick to ask him
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.020]   for things in regard in lines as to what that is.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.840]   Do you guys know what I'm kind of saying by that?
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.160]   I'm getting kind of blank stares.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.800]   Okay, so what I mean by that is,
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   if our dad owns a restaurant,
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.920]   and I'm trying to open up a restaurant,
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.440]   then I will talk to him about those things
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.460]   because I know who he is.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.180]   I know he's aware.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.980]   I know he has wisdom in regards to these things.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.400]   I know he has strings he can pull.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.760]   I know there are a lot of things.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.600]   Based on who he is, how I ask will matter.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.560]   If my dad knows nothing about it, I won't go to him.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.440]   So who I believe God to be
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.160]   is going to start to affect how I pray.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.320]   And when we pray, and when we evaluate our prayer,
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.800]   and we think like, man, why don't I come to him enough?
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.100]   Why don't I pray to him about everything?
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.280]   It says a lot about how I view God.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.320]   It says a ton about what I believe he's capable of,
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.900]   what he's like, what he desires, or what he doesn't desire.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.280]   And so then we have kind of a shadowy figure
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.560]   that we're praying to, and then we just kind of come,
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.640]   and we give our prayer request.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.960]   Here it is.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.720]   We try to generate the best we can.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.720]   What about in our prayers tonight?
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.400]   Are we going to be fully aware tonight?
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.600]   Because there's a long list.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.520]   There's a whole page of prayer
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.080]   that things that you can be praying for tonight.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.280]   Through it all, will you remember
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.840]   the one that you're praying to?
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.920]   And that needs to be regularly practiced,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.040]   even in the middle of prayer, because we forget.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.320]   And we just kind of get into this mode of like,
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.520]   here are the requests, here's my dutiful prayer.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.120]   See, I prayed for that person like I was supposed to,
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.900]   and we forget who he is.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.120]   If you believe that God is sovereign,
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.100]   don't you think that's gonna affect your prayer?
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.800]   If you really believe that I'm looking at God,
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.120]   and he is a sovereign God,
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.480]   don't you think that's going to change the way you pray?
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.920]   That you'll start to ask of him things that really matter?
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.760]   Do you believe that God is all-powerful?
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.080]   Don't you think that's going to matter?
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.480]   Like, that sight of who God is.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.760]   If we believe that he is actually all-powerful,
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.120]   don't you think our prayers will become bigger?
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.700]   Do you believe that God loves you as a father?
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:15.020]   Don't you think that's gonna change the way you pray?
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.220]   The confidence in which you come before him?
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.780]   If you believe that God is everything,
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.180]   that he is the center to everything,
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.660]   and all of life is about him,
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.860]   don't you think that's going to change the way you pray
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.960]   and what you pray for?
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.620]   Our prayers are gonna reflect a lot about how we see God.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.700]   Be aware of that tonight.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.100]   'Cause again, it's gonna be a big chunk of time,
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.940]   like 30 plus minutes of just prayer.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.140]   And if we lose who God is in the midst of prayer,
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.740]   then we have to really evaluate and think,
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.700]   what am I doing?
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.580]   Keep God squarely at the center of prayer tonight.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:00.660]   And just to turn you, just one last note here.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.340]   When you think of Jesus when he says, "Pray like this,"
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.500]   I think this is a big part of the reason
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.020]   why he says start with,
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.860]   "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.300]   "Your kingdom come, your will be done."
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.780]   Because there's a great orientation
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.400]   that needs to be happening.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.860]   Prayer is not just a ritual or religious exercise.
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.100]   You're talking to God.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.660]   You're coming to him with requests.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.480]   And you're desiring what he desires.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.900]   It's a very intimate thing.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.460]   Where we are,
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.500]   God is listening to his children.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.140]   So I think we can marvel at that.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.740]   And I think if we do that,
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.660]   our prayers can become a lot more powerful and refreshing.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.700]   Because it's not just something we're doing.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.780]   So if we could keep that in mind tonight.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.420]   Now, we're gonna be doing, again,
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.760]   something similar to what we did last month.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.500]   Which is, I'm gonna give you guys just a moment here,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.000]   after we go through this list of prayer,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.180]   to go ahead and turn to each other and say prayer requests.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.160]   And then after that, you're gonna have that chunk of time
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.260]   to pray unfettered.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.020]   So if you can get that list out.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:15.260]   It's gonna be broken up into five major sections.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.180]   And the first one is the sins to confess.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.260]   And we did something like this last time.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.340]   Sins of commission, what sins have I committed
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.240]   or have stopped struggling with?
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.580]   And this is a time to take stock of that.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.780]   I think we're much more aware of sin than we might think.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.440]   And we're just very good at burying those things.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.560]   And then sins of omission,
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.820]   what have I not done that I should have done?
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.560]   So you can ask these types of questions
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.500]   when you're thinking about sin in your life.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.560]   What are the things that you've found yourself
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.860]   grumbling over lately?
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.260]   Where have you been very complaining in your heart?
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:57.360]   Have you been deceitful in your life?
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.440]   Are you lying right now to somebody?
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.580]   Are you hiding?
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.680]   Are you in the dark?
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.800]   Have you been lazy?
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.960]   Have you been struggling with pride and arrogance?
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.200]   Bitterness and anger?
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.680]   And this is the time where you can take this,
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.560]   that chunk to really go deep and say,
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.480]   God, I confess these things before you.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.840]   As it says in 1 John 1,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.720]   he calls us to confess because we have sin in us.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.520]   The second one there is building up of the church.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.000]   Letter A, are there relationships that need to be reconciled
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.880]   that we have been ignoring?
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.200]   Do you have something against someone
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.360]   or does someone have something against you?
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.480]   I ask you there as you're praying,
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.020]   really consider God's love, God's forgiveness.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.880]   Have you been dealing with people
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.600]   the way God has dealt with you?
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.360]   Have you been keeping people in mind
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.060]   and desiring to love others the way God has loved you?
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.720]   Have you been seeking people out?
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.880]   Have you been pursuing them if there's conflict between you?
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.400]   In the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.880]   there's a section that talks about this where it says,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.020]   like if you have an offering, hey, leave it at the altar
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.600]   and go and reconcile with your brother
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.240]   before you come back and give it.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:26.400]   Letter B, pray for people God has been placing on your heart
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.940]   to reach out to and encourage.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.860]   Have there been people that just,
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.380]   when you think about people you desire to reach out to,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.140]   are there people there,
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.040]   but then you just haven't been reaching out to them?
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.340]   You haven't been praying for them?
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.020]   And their names are just constantly there.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.680]   You're just made aware of them
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.100]   by something that God has placed on your heart.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.460]   Well, pray that you and all of us,
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:55.420]   that we would all pursue a deep relationship
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.900]   within this church for mutual edification,
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.700]   through reading, praying, and speaking the gospel
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.540]   in judge's lives.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.820]   That we wouldn't just say like,
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.060]   hey, I'm just gonna grab a meal with them,
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.860]   but that we would be going this long distance
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.680]   to saying that we want to be a church that prays for this.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.780]   That we read together, that we pray together regularly.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.780]   Letter C, pray for sexual purity,
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.700]   specifically as more and more people are struggling
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.360]   with porn and sexual immorality.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.940]   Pray for a greater resolve to fight against impurity
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.260]   in what we watch,
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.020]   in what we allow ourselves to kind of think about.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.300]   Remember, this is like one of those sins
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.560]   that people just reside in such darkness.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.980]   If that's you, I mean,
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.100]   hopefully you would have already confessed those sins.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.820]   But pray for others.
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.980]   Pray deeply that Satan wouldn't have a foothold
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.100]   in their lives.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.940]   Pray that they would have the confidence
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.100]   to come out of the darkness and to confess their sins
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.020]   with you, and that if you need to do that,
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.780]   that you would do that with others.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.300]   It's such a damaging thing for the church
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.060]   because it's in such darkness.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.740]   Letter D, pray for specific people in your lives.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.180]   You could pray for a home group
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.320]   or small group members by name.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.120]   You could pray for the church leadership by name.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.020]   Pray for someone you met this past week.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.980]   For the very first time, pray for them.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.140]   Pray for people you know
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.180]   are struggling through different things.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:33.980]   Letter E, pray for the gradual opening of the church.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.260]   This is a tough one
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.380]   because as things are opening up,
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.220]   we know how volatile these kinds of conversations are.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.140]   But as small groups and home groups,
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.680]   and we're gonna be doing the church retreat in person,
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.340]   there's gonna be VBS in person,
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.580]   it's gonna be a lot to navigate through.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.060]   But pray for all of these things
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.940]   as everything starts to go live.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.380]   People have varying opinions on what should
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.220]   or shouldn't be done.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.500]   Pray.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.920]   Pray that the leadership would have wisdom
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.780]   in making decisions that's for the best of the church.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.700]   But also pray that church members
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.180]   would be willing to consider others
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.220]   more important than themselves.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.220]   That we wouldn't be people saying,
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.140]   like, this is right, this is wrong.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.140]   But that we would really operate in that realm of grace.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.900]   That we desire what is best for those that are around us,
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:25.600]   and that we are doing everything in order to ensure that.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.500]   Pray that God would protect the church from the enemy
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.420]   because he has been using, obviously, these things,
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.940]   this situation and this particular circumstance, to divide.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.740]   And let's be honest, it's entered the church.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.020]   It's entered between us.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.300]   Let's pray.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.700]   Let's pray that the enemy wouldn't have that foothold,
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.780]   and that we would maybe not be able
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.560]   to all get onto the exact same page,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.240]   but the same page that we are all on
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.540]   is that we love each other,
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.740]   and that we desire to grow with one another.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.540]   Letter F, pray that we would use any and all
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.780]   of our finances, well, for God's kingdom and not our own.
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.100]   Pray that if there is anything
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.620]   that you're not surrendering in your own life
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.660]   when it comes to finances,
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.660]   that you would let go of the things
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:15.060]   that are aimed at building up your own life,
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.660]   alone, and not God's kingdom.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.920]   Letter G, pray for local churches.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.320]   Pray for the leadership at other churches.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.440]   There are many churches around us.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.640]   We're just one church.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.820]   Imagine the battle going on in every church out there,
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.020]   and pray, pray for them,
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.880]   that as the leaders in other churches
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.280]   are wrestling with various challenges
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.680]   coming from what happened in this past year,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.460]   pray for clarity and greater faith,
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.160]   that leaders here and there wouldn't fall
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.560]   to people-pleasing and fear,
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.300]   wouldn't fall to just doing
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.540]   what would be the easiest, per se,
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.980]   but to really do what would be the most honoring to God
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.480]   based on the truth of his word.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.700]   The third section will be concerning the gospel,
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.780]   spreading the gospel.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.020]   Locally, pray for coworkers and family members
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.860]   who are not Christian.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.820]   Pray for them by name.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.100]   We did this last time, too.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.380]   Pray for opportunities.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.180]   Now, this is a good time to go back
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.380]   and reflect on who you prayed for last time,
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.580]   but pray for them again.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.560]   Pray regularly.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.920]   Pray for opportunities that might come up in coming days.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.720]   Pray if there's an opportunity that you foresee coming,
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.700]   that you would be bold and you would have the courage
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.740]   to approach them at that moment.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.840]   Pray that God would use the church
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.100]   to bring greater numbers of people
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.800]   to be followers of Christ.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:43.240]   Globally, pray for Alex and Jen,
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.500]   Harry and Linda in Taiwan as they wisely
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.300]   try to navigate through uncertainty.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.620]   It's really hard right now.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.780]   If you have a relationship with them,
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.580]   pray for them specifically.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.680]   If you don't know them well, pray for them
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.660]   as people who desire to spread the gospel
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.180]   in the place that God places them,
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.960]   that they would be able to function off of wisdom
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.540]   and a love for the Lord
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.400]   and not according to their own plans.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.660]   Pray for the India pastors,
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.800]   especially, specifically tonight,
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.580]   with Pastor Isaac passing away.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.080]   We all heard the news,
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.540]   but if you have not yet prayed for him,
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.780]   let's use tonight to collectively
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.240]   really lift up these pastors.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:28.140]   They had a funeral for him this past week,
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.180]   and obviously, I mean, they're gonna be very sad about this.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.020]   This is hard.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.060]   This is someone they've been looking to
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.420]   and praying for for so long,
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.220]   and now everything has changed,
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.460]   and there's a huge hole in their hearts there.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.840]   Let's pray for them,
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.760]   that the believers there would be encouraged,
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.320]   that the hope of eternity,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.680]   that the hope in God's unshattering, unbreakable plan
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.560]   would be resting strong in their hearts,
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.640]   that they would be comforted,
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.560]   and that they would push each other more and more even,
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.840]   and that God would raise up strong leaders
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.620]   and someone that would be able to fill those shoes.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.640]   Pray for all the missionaries who have been displaced
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.280]   because of persecution and COVID.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.660]   Pray that they would clearly see God's sovereign hands
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.860]   in all that's going on.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.300]   There's so many missionaries around the world,
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.480]   and we need to remember that moving into number four here,
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.380]   that there are persecuted brothers and sisters
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.220]   around the world.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.100]   There's so much talk about the difficulties
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.500]   that we're going through, and it is difficult,
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.940]   but there are brothers and sisters
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.380]   who need our prayers tonight.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.600]   Our prayers can be felt across the world.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.200]   It won't be fully recognized maybe, but it could be felt.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.080]   We need to pray for them.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.480]   We need to pray for our brothers and sisters
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.820]   who we've never met before,
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:56.060]   who are tonight at risk of their own lives.
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.680]   Pray for them.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.840]   Let us see, pray for greater opportunities for the gospel
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.760]   to spread locally and globally as the pandemic
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.140]   and racial tensions have created a greater sense
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.560]   of unrest in our generation.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:12.580]   If you're not aware, there are a lot of people
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.620]   coming through the church right now,
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.340]   and they might just look like a newcomer,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.860]   but they might be someone who don't know God at all
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.340]   and who are looking for answers,
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.280]   and they just look like everyone else,
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.500]   but let's pray for them,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.860]   and let's look out for them on Sunday.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.140]   Even in college ministry, this quarter has been crazy
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.660]   because constantly there are students coming through
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.940]   right now who have never once set foot in church,
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.240]   and this quarter is their first time.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.580]   Let's pray for them.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.920]   Let's pray for more opportunities.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.880]   Let's pray that we would seek for more people
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.920]   who would come to know Christ,
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.440]   who would be saved from God's wrath,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.020]   and let's pray specifically because, again,
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.800]   this is a very good time.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.780]   This is a very, I would say, ripe time for us
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.480]   to not only be praying but reaching out in that manner.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.720]   Moving on to Roman numeral four there, section four,
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.400]   pray for the upcoming events in the church.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.120]   Now, I just listed a few here, and there are a lot more,
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.540]   and you can pray a lot more concerning the things going on
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.440]   even in your own affinity,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.180]   but take that time to just, one at a time,
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.880]   if you have the time at the end,
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.560]   to pray for these things that are coming up.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.920]   We have the golf tournament tomorrow,
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.480]   and you can look through all of these things,
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.200]   but that they wouldn't be prayerless events
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.760]   that are just happening, right?
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.840]   That we just say this is a fundraiser for missions,
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.300]   and so we just do it.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.920]   Let's make sure that we gird all of those things in prayer,
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.160]   and that we're saturating that in prayer,
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.720]   and that we're lifting it up to God and saying,
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.240]   God, of course, things might not go exactly
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.480]   the way we want it to, but God, would you empower it?
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.300]   Would your Holy Spirit move through it,
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.400]   even though it's something we're just doing?
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.360]   Okay, so there's a lot to pray for.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.820]   This is not a duties list tonight.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.160]   You do not need to get your pen
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.960]   and strike each one out as you're going.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.920]   Pray, and get through as much as you can, yes,
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.080]   but take the time to go through the ones
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.400]   that weigh heavy on your heart.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.400]   But before we go into that, let's go ahead,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.880]   and I'll give you about five minutes or so
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.960]   to turn to maybe in groups of three or so
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.640]   to pray, or to share prayer requests.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.080]   And just like last time, please don't take too much time,
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.200]   because if you do, then at the end,
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.600]   the last person's gonna be rushing, right?
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.440]   That's not fair.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.080]   So go ahead and turn to each other now.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.000]   Write it down on the back of your paper,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.600]   and then that's gonna be a part of our list.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.440]   I'll bring us back, okay,
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.240]   and to enter into that time together.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.560]   (audience chattering)

[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:31.200]   Okay, all ready or not?
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:37.460]   You were given fair warning, so.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.800]   Let's bring it back towards the center.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:55.960]   All right, so, keeping in mind that you have a whole paper
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.360]   and don't forget to get to that side.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.200]   And a good thing is you can take this home and pray,
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.560]   like continually pray for these things,
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.800]   so you don't have to stress out tonight.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.960]   Because if you didn't notice last time,
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.560]   when you were given that big chunk of prayer,
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.720]   you realized, wow, I could really pray for a long time.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.440]   There's a lot to pray for.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:19.040]   And so tonight, let's use the next 30 to 35 minutes
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.220]   or so to pray.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:25.040]   Please remember, if it is difficult, it's okay.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.240]   It's an okay thing for it to be difficult.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.920]   We are practicing this together and work through it.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.980]   And at the end, after that time,
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.140]   we're gonna be having the praise team come up.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.640]   We're gonna be worshiping together and I pray that,
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.320]   that really after having been praying to our God
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:45.640]   for 30, 35 minutes, even our worship changes.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.880]   Even our praise and the songs that we sing to God
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:52.720]   is different and that we would be able to be
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.440]   in full awareness and I just, I pray to God
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.820]   for the last 30 minutes and we would want to worship Him.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.680]   Okay, let me go ahead and pray for us
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.320]   and then we'll go into this time.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.140]   Let's pray.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   Heavenly Father, we pray that over the next 30 minutes
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.840]   or so that you would help us to have the concentration,
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.720]   to have undistracted, determined motivation.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.000]   Father, would you help us to fight through this,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.560]   God, to fight to remember you and to give to you
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.760]   everything that's on our hearts.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.840]   Help us, Lord, to dive deep.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.680]   Help this not to be just a time where we're dutifully
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.720]   going through a list but Lord, that we are coming
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.420]   into your throne room of grace.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.280]   And again, as we've learned, Lord,
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.920]   that we are coming to our Father.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.880]   And God, that we might desire so heavily
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.080]   the things we're asking.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:57.800]   Lord, that we would plead with you and cry out to you
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.400]   because we know that you are the only sovereign God.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.200]   Lord, we're frail and weak but we pray to you
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.480]   an omnipotent God.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.120]   God, we trust in you with all of these prayers.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.680]   Lord, allow these things to dissipate our anxieties,
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.180]   that our trust in you and our faith would be pure.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.720]   So God, thank you that you give us such a privilege
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.160]   and honor to pray to you.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:06.420]   Amen, would you join me in prayer?
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:10.420]   Heavenly Father, we thank You, Lord, for You are a God who is
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:14.420]   gracious and compassionate, slow to anger,
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:16.420]   abounding in love and kindness.
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:20.420]   Father, we thank You so much for this opportunity tonight for us
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:24.420]   as a church to gather and to pray.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:27.420]   Lord, we know that more than anything else that we do,
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:31.420]   coming before You and asking You for help, Father,
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:34.420]   God, is the best use of our time.
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:37.420]   Lord, I pray that You would open our eyes to be able to see
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:41.420]   things through Your lens, through Your eyes, Lord.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:45.420]   Lord, we live day by day entangled with various
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:49.420]   responsibilities, distracted, things that are going on at work,
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.420]   in our homes, at school.
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:55.420]   But in the midst of all these things that distract us, Lord,
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:37:01.420]   help us as we pray to have an eternal perspective.
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:05.420]   Lord, that we would be kingdom-minded to pursue things
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.420]   that truly, really matter.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:13.420]   Teach us what it means, God, to be truly broken for the lost,
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:18.420]   what it means to pray, Lord God, with a genuine desire to see
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:23.420]   lost souls saved, even the ones we do not know.
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:27.420]   To help us, Lord, to live by faith and not by sight.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:31.420]   Teach us, you know, especially with our theme this year, Lord,
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:34.420]   as we desire to be a church that really prays.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:37.420]   For though we are weak, Lord, would You make us strong,
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:40.420]   that we would be vessels used for Your kingdom.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:43.420]   And help us, Lord, to be a church that exalts and glorifies You
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:45.420]   in all that we do.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:48.420]   So again, Lord, we thank You so much for this evening,
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:53.420]   for this opportunity to gather, to worship You, to pray, Lord.
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:58.420]   Would we be a church that truly glorifies You in all that we do.
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:01.420]   So we thank You, Lord, for all that You are to us and all that
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:03.420]   You have done for us.
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:10.420]   Thank you, everyone, for coming this evening.
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.420]   We want to ask you guys to be safe.
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.420]   Thank you again.
