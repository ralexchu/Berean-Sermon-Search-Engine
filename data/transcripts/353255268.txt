[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   - Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.800]   If you would take a moment to turn to your apps or your bulletins for some of our announcements.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.960]   The first is that we have a special baptism service scheduled for September 29th, Sunday,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.040]   at 2.30 p.m.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.400]   Please just mark that on your calendars because it's an important time for our church members
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.680]   to come together, hear and listen to the testimony of those brothers and sisters who are professing
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.340]   their faith.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.080]   But also, if you would like to get baptized, please email Pastor Nathan Kwok over at the
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.300]   email that you see there.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.920]   Another thing I'd like to highlight is that for all the parents in our church who have
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.520]   their children in our education department, there's going to be a meeting on August 18th
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.520]   at 2 p.m.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.080]   So please make sure you mark your calendars for that.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.160]   There's also intentional moms fellowship sign up for the ladies to come together and fellowship.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.880]   It happens Friday mornings, 9.30 to 11.30 a.m.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.240]   So if you'd like to participate, please go ahead and go to the teen URL link and you
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.080]   can sign up there.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.280]   The last announcement is that we have an all-church picnic scheduled for October 20th.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.920]   So please make sure you save the date.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.680]   We're going to start sign-ups a little bit later on, but we just want you guys to make
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.940]   sure you can participate.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.780]   We don't have too many events through the year where the whole church can come together.
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.120]   We want our church, even though we're growing in size or whatever it may be, to be able
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.600]   to join together and be in fellowship with each other and to know who are also part of
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   the community.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.560]   So please make sure you save that date and the registration is going to be coming soon.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.440]   Well, as you guys know, this weekend we have most of our couples and family members over
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.140]   at a retreat in Palm Desert.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.080]   So we want to just keep them in prayer that that's a spiritually just fruitful time, both
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.560]   fellowship but more so in learning, focusing on what does it mean to be a family that's
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560]   anchored in Christ.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.120]   So let's continue to pray for them as they're still over there at that retreat.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.840]   Okay, please take your Bibles and turn to Psalm chapter 73.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.520]   Now it's 28 verses and we're going to read it together and we'll walk down this passage
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.960]   and then take a moment to pray for God's blessing on our time and the Word.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.320]   Psalm 73.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.120]   It says this, a Psalm of Asaph.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.360]   "Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling, my steps had almost slipped.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.080]   For I was envious of the arrogant as I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.640]   For there are no pains in their death and their body is fat.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.640]   They're not in trouble as other men, nor are they plagued like mankind.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.520]   Therefore pride is their necklace, the garment of violence covers them.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.640]   Their eyes bulge from fatness, the imaginations of their heart run riot.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.200]   They mock and wickedly speak of oppression.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.080]   They speak from on high.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.920]   They have set their mouths against the heavens and their tongue parades through the earth.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.600]   Therefore his people return to this place.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.440]   The waters of abundance are drunk by them.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.480]   They say, 'How does God know?
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.920]   And is their knowledge what the most high?
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.000]   Behold, these are the wicked.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.480]   And always at ease, they have increased in wealth.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.400]   Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.600]   For I have been stricken all day long and chastened every morning.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.560]   If I had said, 'I will speak thus,' behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.880]   children.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.520]   Then I pondered to understand this, and it was troublesome in my sight.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.880]   Until I came into the sanctuary of God.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.400]   Then I perceived their end.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.560]   Surely you set them in slippery places.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.000]   You cast them down to destruction.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.760]   How they are destroyed in a moment.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.880]   They are utterly swept away by the sudden terrors.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.920]   Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when aroused you will despise their form.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.120]   When my heart was embittered and I was pierced within, then I was senseless and ignorant.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.360]   I was like a beast before you.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.960]   Nevertheless, I am continually with you.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.600]   You have taken hold of my right hand.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.000]   With your counsel you will guide me and afterward receive me to glory.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.240]   Whom have I in heaven but you?
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.360]   And besides you I desire nothing on earth.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.640]   My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.780]   For behold, those who are far from you will perish.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.880]   You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   But as for me, the nearness of God is my good.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.760]   I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell of your works.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.800]   God, we ask for your spiritual blessing that as we jump into your word, as we listen, Lord,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.600]   that your spirit will grant to us open ears, humble hearts, receptiveness.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.040]   And also, Father, God, help us to have spiritual eyes to see, is there any wickedness, any
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.760]   roots of bitterness in our hearts?
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.680]   Is there any envy and jealousy in our soul?
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.240]   God, that you would uproot those things and cause us to be filled with the wonder of your
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.680]   gracious work in our lives.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.600]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.040]   Okay, jumping right into the passage, you notice that in Psalm 73 for Asaph, there is
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.760]   an incredible dilemma.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:59.160]   So in verses one through three, Asaph describes in a nice introduction a dilemma that he sees.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.800]   So I'm just going to read it again for us.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.920]   And he says, "Surely God is good to Israel.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.280]   This he knows as a principle of truth to those who are pure in heart.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.800]   But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling, my steps had almost slipped, and I was envious
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.080]   of the arrogant as I saw the prosperity of the wicked."
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.640]   What is he talking about?
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.520]   He's talking about actually a really common dilemma for a lot of people.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.720]   For a lot of people.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.520]   You know what that is?
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.680]   You go on Facebook, you go on social media, you watch TV shows, maybe reality TV shows,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.600]   you watch certain movies, and you see glamorous living.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.960]   You see prosperous, free living where people are doing all kinds of things.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.760]   Nowadays, you know what's really popular?
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.260]   Experiences.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.240]   People who are able to go out to the remotest part of the jungle and count there.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.280]   People who are able to go see different cultures.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.240]   People who are able to go out and do all kinds of stuff.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.600]   None of that is wicked.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   It's great.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.920]   But you know what happens?
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.160]   All of a sudden, there's this weird tingling feeling in you that says, "That's so awesome."
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.960]   And then you look down and you go, "My life sucks."
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.600]   There is this immediate comparison that happens between what you see on TV, what you see on
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.800]   social media, and your quick evaluation of yourself.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   You know what that is called?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   It's called jealousy.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.480]   It's called envy.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:36.360]   Asaph immediately introduces us to a stumbling, to a dilemma, to a problem, and he says, "I
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.480]   was envious of the arrogant."
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.880]   He says, "I was envious of the arrogant."
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.720]   Just really quickly.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.520]   If I were to be very honest with you, I'm a pastor that's dedicated my life to the Lord's
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.240]   work, to the Lord's people, to the Lord's church and His mission field.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.960]   Am I not envious sometimes?
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.480]   Do I not have ambitions and desires?
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.240]   Just the other day, I was talking to my wife saying, "Dude, I saw this one episode with
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.240]   this guy.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.400]   He was a professional in the working workforce.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.560]   He was an engineer for a long time, and he just decided, 'You know what?
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.160]   I'm going to take my family and go live out into one of these open land where there aren't
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.160]   so many people.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.640]   It's not so congested.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   He has a view of a mountain.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.240]   He has an axe that he chops his wood with, and it's so manly, and I'm just like, 'Wow.'"
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.680]   And immediately, my wife looks over and goes, "But you can't be a pastor like that."
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.640]   That's true.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.240]   But anytime you see a certain kind of living where there's freedom, where there's luxury,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.400]   does that not elicit some kind of wishful thinking, kind of fantasy land?
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.160]   Now, again, I'm not saying immediately that's all wicked, but notice how that quickly turns
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.640]   into something for Asaph, and you know what that turns into?
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.480]   It turns into a sourness of heart.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.520]   And biblically, that kind of sourness of heart is called bitterness.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.960]   And what that bitterness does is it begins to judge.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.600]   It begins to shape a reality.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   It begins to shape a perspective.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.200]   And now in his eyes, all those people out there, those guys, they're wicked people.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.480]   They're arrogant people.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.800]   They're vicious people.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:30.280]   What we have is a heart's desire turning into a position of authority and judging the world.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.800]   Are we not successful to that?
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.040]   Have you ever never felt that?
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.360]   Where you have any kind of envy and desire, and when you compare and you compare and contrast
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.360]   their life versus your life, all of a sudden, you are tempted to have not just simply a
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:53.080]   kind of jealousy, but a kind of embitterment, a kind of discontent, depression?
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.040]   Ugh, there's an angst in you.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.640]   And there is a conclusion typically at the end of that paragraph.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.480]   You know what that conclusion is?
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.840]   This isn't fair.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.480]   My life sucks.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.680]   So many people talk like that in our generation.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.360]   There is a complaint towards the Lord.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.240]   Where is mine?
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.560]   What's in it for me?
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.200]   And should I even continue trying to walk this noble path when all of those individuals
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.080]   with their freedoms and liberties, they're just living it up?
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.560]   Is this worth it for me?
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.200]   That is a very, very honest and real struggle that I think a lot of people have in our day.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.560]   Psalm 73 is so real.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.680]   It's absolutely relevant for us today.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.120]   And so, I want to talk about this a little bit more in this dilemma.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.000]   Deep down here, there are a couple of things that is a dilemma for Asaph.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.080]   Why?
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.320]   Because there's a struggle.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.800]   You see, Asaph wouldn't have a struggle if he wasn't taught biblically.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.400]   You know what he was taught?
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.880]   God is good, right?
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.560]   For all of you here, you're here because you know God is good.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.280]   If you believe God was a horrible, horrible, harsh being, you wouldn't be in these seats
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.160]   because then you would have to listen to a person you can't trust.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160]   But you know God is good.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   That's the dilemma.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.280]   Asaph knew from when he was a child, he was taught, he knows deep down in his heart, God
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.960]   is good to Israel.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.160]   He's good to people.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.800]   He's good to those who are pure in heart.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.640]   But then what is the problem?
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:35.880]   What the problem is, that completely contrasts and conflicts with what he sees with his eyes.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.000]   He says, "Oh, on the contrary, I see this conflict.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.840]   I know you're good, but look.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.880]   Look at the arrogance.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.920]   Look at those people.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.560]   Those people who are vile, always selling themselves, always marketing themselves.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   Look how good I am.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.320]   Look how much I've done.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.840]   Look what I've experienced.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   Follow me.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   Subscribe, subscribe."
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   Right?
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.600]   Look at these people.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.280]   How is it that these individuals are being blessed by God when I know God is good?
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.280]   Brothers and sisters, this may not seem like the biggest problem in the world.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.880]   However, this is a major issue.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   Why?
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.080]   This is at the core of the struggle of faith.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.480]   Will you judge with your eyes on what you see?
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.040]   Or will you judge by faith, by what God has told you?
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.680]   What Asaph sees with his eyes is just all kinds of backwardness where wicked people
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   are blessed.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.880]   They have possessions, luxuries, and pleasures.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.000]   And then immediately he looks at himself and is like, "The nation of Israel, me and people
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.560]   like me, we barely have little.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.840]   We only have provision for that day.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.040]   What gives?"
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.800]   And so that's my question to you.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.560]   Do you currently operate by sight and you judge what's fair and what's not fair based
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.000]   on what you see with your eyes?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.400]   Or are you judging things based on what God has told you, his word?
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.200]   What he said he's going to do into the future that you have not yet seen?
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.840]   That's the struggle of faith, isn't it?
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.680]   Now I'm going to ask this question.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.440]   What did Asaph see with his eyes then?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.480]   What caused him so much grief?
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.400]   Let's continue to look at our passage in Psalm 73 verses 4 through 12.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.760]   The next section I'm going to call this, the fat cats.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.760]   The fat cats.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.760]   Why?
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.320]   Look what he says.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.480]   Verses 4.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.720]   "For there are no pains in their death.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.800]   Their body is fat.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.240]   They are not in trouble as other men, nor are they plagued like mankind.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.080]   Therefore pride is their necklace.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.960]   The garment of violence covers them.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.120]   Their eyes bulge with fatness.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.400]   The imagination of their hearts from riot.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.880]   They mock and wickedly speak of oppression.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.040]   They speak from on high.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.480]   They set their mouths against the heavens and their tongues parades through the earth.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.280]   For as people return to this place when waters of abundance are drunk by them, they say,
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.040]   'How does God know?
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.520]   And is their knowledge with the most high?
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.200]   Behold, these are the wicked.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   Always at ease.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.760]   They have increased in wealth.'"
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.760]   What did he see?
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.240]   I'm going to break down what he saw into three categories.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.760]   And I have it right up here.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.160]   First, that he just saw like, "They have so much."
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.360]   Does that sound really childish?
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.600]   Yes, it does.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:35.240]   When a little boy looks at his friend and his friend has twice the number of toys, candy,
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.440]   whatever it may be, immediately he's like, "That's not fair."
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   Why?
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.120]   Why is that not fair?
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.160]   Because he has more than me, right?
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.760]   But that's what he sees though.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.760]   Look at verse 7.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.680]   "Their eyes are bulging with fatness."
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.880]   I mean, the imagery is quite descriptive.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.920]   It's like, they have so much.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.280]   Their flesh is coming out the different sides of their body, right?
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.200]   They have so much.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   I mean, we live in a generation...
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:05.160]   Again, remember like for a long, long period of time, throughout history, people lived
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.440]   in a kind of lifestyle where they had provision for the day.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.520]   You guys have probably heard that most of the people throughout all of history didn't
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.680]   have, you know, shoes for running, shoes for tennis, shoes for basketball, and shoes for
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.680]   style, right?
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.560]   They had one pair of shoes, one cloak, one whatever it may be.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.360]   And he's looking at them like, "Look at how much they have."
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   It's just spewing out.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.680]   Look at their abundance.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:36.840]   My question to you real quickly, have you seen people with museums of possessions and
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   become jealous?
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.560]   Recently, I confess, sometimes I watch these silly YouTube videos.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.480]   One of the silly ones that I saw was Celine Dion was on car karaoke with the talk show
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.480]   host.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.480]   You guys know what I'm talking about?
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   Some of you have seen it.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.600]   If you haven't, it's kind of funny.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.560]   This guy, the talk show host, is in his car.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.640]   He has a celebrity who's an amazing singer, and he just starts singing karaoke in the
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.640]   car.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.640]   It happened to be Celine Dion.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.800]   Crazy figure, one of the most well-known singers in the world, right?
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:13.000]   Did you know that she has over 10,000 shoes?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.560]   She has to have a separate building to house her shoes.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   They've created some kind of mechanical structure to produce where they could have a screen.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.440]   She looks up certain shoes, and it comes to her.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.400]   That's insane.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.840]   What happened was that the talk show host brought some of her shoes and said, "You have
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   too many.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   Give it away."
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.840]   She was like, "No."
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.960]   Then she just started passing them out.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.920]   She rolled down the window like, "Hey," and everyone was like, "Oh my God, it's Celine
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.000]   Dion," and then she would pass out her shoes.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.120]   I'm sitting there, kind of dumbfounded.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   Why?
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.120]   Because I all of a sudden had this reaction.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.960]   "She's going to give away those shoes?
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   Those shoes are quite nice."
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   I was like, "What am I doing?
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   Put this away."
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:17:01.080]   Now, why do I bring up that silly scenario is because I'm willing to bet that when you
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.000]   hear something like that, half of you says, "That's ridiculous."
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.240]   The other half of you says, "That'd be kind of cool," right?
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.320]   Because I know some of you have shoe collections.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.280]   Part of you thinks it would be nice to have a machine that comes around when you pick
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.520]   the shoe and it matches your outfit and just comes to you.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.640]   Now, the shoes are my cup of tea.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.480]   Do you know who I kind of envy?
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.320]   Have you guys heard of Jay Leno?
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.280]   Do you know how many cars he owns?
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   342 cars.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.840]   Some, some of the rarest in the world.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.520]   Does he have a separate building for those cars?
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.520]   Of course he does.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   He has multiple.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.200]   Now, why do I bring this up?
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.040]   Not because I'm trying to just simply talk about these famous actors, famous talk show
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:49.120]   hosts and singers, but because those videos have millions of hits.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.360]   Because Jay Leno has his own channel just on going, walking around his cars.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.320]   And people envy that.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.480]   I'm confessing for you right now.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.560]   People envy that stuff.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.600]   That could cause a dilemma for you.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.520]   It could cause your heart to stumble.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.520]   Yes?
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.080]   Now, you might be sitting there like, I'm going to be honest, man.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   I'm very content living in my apartment.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.160]   I don't need 50,000 pairs of clothes.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.880]   I literally have like six pairs of clothes, like outfits in my closet, and I'm good.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.880]   Okay.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.120]   I get that.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.840]   But I'm willing to bet many of us are tempted by the next thing, which is the wicked are
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.240]   more free.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.520]   Think about what he says here.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.040]   He says there's no pain in their death.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.760]   He says there's no trouble.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.060]   There's no plague.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.060]   There's no limitation.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.060]   Why?
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.160]   Because when nations run riot, look at what he's talking about.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.640]   They always are at what?
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.640]   Verse 12.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   Ease.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:51.360]   How many of you would die for at least a month with no stress?
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.920]   Right?
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.560]   A vast array of counseling scenarios happen because there's so much stress in your workplace,
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.120]   so much stress in your home.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.160]   The expectations of your family, the expectations of the people around you, the expectations
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.220]   of people who are dependent on you is so burdensome.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.560]   But the rich, the wicked, they're at so much ease.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:20.420]   They have no pain, no troubles, no burden, no sickness.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.900]   And then there can be a sense of bitterness.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.620]   I've actually heard people talk like that.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.220]   It's like, "You know, one day I wish that guy, he needs to suffer a little bit."
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.740]   Not that I would wish ill upon their soul, but he needs to suffer a little bit because
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.540]   man, that fool does not understand what it means to live in this world.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.260]   Have you ever thought like that?
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.900]   Some of us are tempted by this and I'd be willing to bet that now in our day, you know,
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.140]   having huge mansions, all that stuff is overrated.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.900]   But some of us would love to have the kind of freedom where we don't have to be burdened
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.900]   by stuff.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.380]   We don't have to be stressed.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.420]   Right?
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.100]   But you know, he also says they're so proud.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.420]   They can just let their mouths run wild.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.420]   They say all this stuff.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.420]   They're like, "You know what?
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.660]   I'm going to speak my mind."
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.860]   And then they boast, "Look what I've done."
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.620]   And you know what's really crazy?
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.780]   Our generation eats that up.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.480]   Seriously.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.540]   There are times when all I'm doing is just watching, even if I'm watching like Christian
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.380]   videos, I get advertisements where this guy, he's like really, really well put together,
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.620]   incredibly articulated, and he's telling me what to do.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.620]   He's like, "You know what?
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.900]   In order to be a man, you got to build your own brand."
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.900]   Right?
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.900]   "You got to invest in who?
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.020]   Yourself.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.420]   You got to build up your skills and you got to sell your..."
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.460]   It's like, "What?"
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:48.900]   And people pay thousands to learn from this guy as their coach.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.180]   That's the truth of our generation.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.500]   People love that stuff.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.500]   People love that stuff.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.900]   And Asaph is looking at this thinking, "What in the world is going on?
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.340]   How is this fair?
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:11.100]   How is God, who I know is good, not allowing us to prosper, but he's giving these wicked
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.820]   individuals prosperity, ease, and peace?
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.260]   Everything seems so backwards.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.620]   What gives?"
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.740]   You can tell his heart is leaning towards bitterness because he's starting to judge
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.740]   now.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.740]   He is starting to judge that this isn't right.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.620]   He is starting to judge that this isn't good.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.100]   Let me ask you, have you ever felt that?
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.740]   Perhaps you haven't verbalized it with words, articulated it in that way, but you've felt
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.400]   that frustration where you deem something, "This ain't right.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.700]   This is not good."
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.540]   Or you just use the kind of more, you know, elementary lingo.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.140]   "This is not okay."
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.300]   Maybe you felt like that.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:02.380]   Perhaps in even more intimate settings, husbands and wives, if there's bitterness between a
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.500]   husband and wife, where a spouse feels like their significant other is getting away with
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.420]   all kinds of arrogance and selfishness, right?
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.740]   Do married people ever point the finger like, "Oh my goodness, you are so prideful and you're
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.020]   so selfish."
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.020]   Does that ever happen?
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.340]   It can.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.620]   Do those sentiments exist in even intimate, private settings?
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.100]   Absolutely.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.300]   Absolutely.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.700]   What do you do?
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.460]   Well, the temptation and the stumbling is this, okay?
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.300]   Verse 13 through 16, let's turn our eyes to the passage and read.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:50.580]   Asaph says this, he's so open and vulnerable, and he says, "Surely, surely, in vain I have
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.700]   kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.740]   I've been stricken all day long and chastened every morning.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.420]   If I said I will speak thus, behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.580]   When I pondered to understand this, it was troublesome in my sight."
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.420]   Do you see the temptation?
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.260]   Do you see the stumbling?
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.860]   Do you see the wrong path?
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.420]   Asaph sees and almost takes.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:21.900]   I'm going to call this next section, verse 13 through 16, the depressed comparison.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.860]   What he says is, "First, when I look at my life compared to their lives, I have done
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.460]   all kinds of goodness, righteousness, come to church, been a noble person, made sure
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.340]   I upheld the standards of God.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.340]   All of that was rubbish.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.860]   It's vain, empty, right?
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.340]   Useless."
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:43.980]   But when you think like that, the temptation is, then forget it.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.980]   You're going to get nasty?
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.020]   You're going to do that to me?
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.500]   Then fine.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.860]   I can outdo you, right?
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.860]   You're going to be selfish?
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.380]   Oh, you don't think I can get angry?
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.180]   Watch me.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.180]   That's the temptation.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.140]   You join them.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:09.580]   And he says, "If I spoke what was in my mind," oh man, you better plug your children's ears.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.140]   Like that's pretty much what he's saying, right?
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.540]   I would have betrayed the generation of your children means, "If I said what I was actually
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.180]   thinking," oh man.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.180]   You see, Asaph felt stricken, reprimanded.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.180]   He felt punished.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.580]   He literally says, "I felt like I was being chastened and oppressed."
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.140]   See, there are people who talk like that sometimes.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:41.100]   When I counsel young individuals who are laboring and striving, and I want to say, yes, I acknowledge
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.100]   and see that people are working hard and it's hard.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.540]   Sometimes life is hard.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.100]   And you feel like you're just hitting wall after wall.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.620]   You tried walking this way, whether it be investing in certain education, maybe you
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.620]   try walking this way.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.660]   You know, I'm not going to cut corners.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.980]   I'm going to make sure I do my work heartily for the Lord.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.780]   I'm going to make sure that I be patient in long suffering, and they just keep hitting
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.980]   wall after wall.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.260]   Yes?
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:14.220]   And as they do that, they start feeling like, "Is God like, is he out to get me?"
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.220]   And there are moments when I counsel people, they literally feel punished.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:26.540]   Brothers and sisters, if any of you are there right now, this passage is going to be so
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.300]   encouraging for you.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.320]   The Lord is not out to get people.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.000]   The Lord is a loving Father.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.860]   Will he guide you?
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.480]   Will he instruct you?
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.420]   Will he discipline you?
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.600]   Yes.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.700]   But it's going to be from his loving hand.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   Amen?
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.860]   But at the same time, Asaph says, "But this is how I felt.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:57.780]   When I looked at their lives and I looked at mine, this is how I felt."
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.280]   Here's the turnaround, verse 17.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   This is huge.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.820]   If you're underlining your Bibles and stuff, you're going to want to do this one.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.820]   Okay?
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:11.140]   What Asaph needed was a dose of reality because he was seeing with his eyes.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.140]   Clearly he observed.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.700]   And he said, "I perceived this thing that's happening in my life."
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:25.860]   But then he says this, verse 17, "It was troublesome, it was burdensome, it was heavy until I came
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.220]   into the sanctuary of God.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.020]   Then I perceived their end."
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.860]   That's an amazing passage right there.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:40.820]   "I came into the presence and sanctuary of the Lord and then I actually genuinely, really
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.860]   perceived.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.180]   I saw truth and reality."
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.400]   That's what he's saying.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.100]   You see, remember I called, I asked you guys to think about this.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.980]   Our Christian struggle is not just you fighting vices of the world.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.660]   It's not just you trying to make sure you're a good Christian, coming to church, making
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.060]   sure that you're a noble man.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.660]   Your struggle is a struggle of faith and you're going to be regularly challenged with, "Will
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:13.100]   you judge the world by what you see or will you judge the world by what you hear from
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.580]   the Lord, by his presence?"
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.020]   And that's exactly what Asaph is doing.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:26.540]   What I'm telling you is this, for us, when we come to church, it's not just a means for
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.540]   you to find little help so that you can get through life.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:36.580]   What you're doing is radically changing how you perceive your entire world.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:43.940]   You're receiving truth from God, expanding your perception, and then accurately and realistically
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.340]   seeing all that is in the universe.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.100]   You're renewing your mind.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.780]   That's what's happening.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.980]   And so what he says is this, "I came into the sanctuary and I perceived."
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:02.460]   What I'm going to do now is show you four things that Asaph saw, four things that Asaph
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:07.140]   saw that's going to help us battle all the stuff that we just said.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.300]   Battle envy, battle bitterness, battle discontent heart, battle depression.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.180]   Asaph saw four pivotal things, and here we go at the first.
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:22.180]   Verse 17 through 20, he says this, "I came into the sanctuary of God and I perceived
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.020]   their end.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.140]   Suddenly you set them in a slippery place and you cast them down to destruction.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.260]   How they are destroyed in a moment.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:36.860]   They're utterly swept away by sudden terrors like a dream when one awakens, O Lord.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.980]   When aroused, you despise their form."
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.420]   You despise their form.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.700]   What is he saying?
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.860]   He sees the end of this game.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.500]   If we were to think of all life as a game, and part of the reason why you think it's
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.940]   unfair is because you think you're trying to play this game by the rules.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.460]   You think you're playing the game the right way, right?
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.460]   You're taking the high road.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:06.420]   And you see all those guys finding loopholes, cheating, being nasty, poor sportsmanship,
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.100]   and you're like, "What?
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.260]   That's not fair."
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.500]   And then he realizes, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.420]   I see the end.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.980]   When I see God, I see a bigger picture, and in that bigger picture, I see the end that
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:24.100]   before them is certain destruction."
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.360]   Before them is not like, "You know, maybe God as judge is going to deal with the wickedness
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.360]   of the people."
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:38.380]   No, he says, "As certain, as certain as possible, God has set their path."
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.540]   You see, what I'm talking about is this.
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:45.740]   There are so many people who will say this, "The number one problem of the Christian faith
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.620]   is the problem of evil."
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:54.220]   How in the world is God who is supposed to be good and powerful allowing all sorts of
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.900]   wickedness, these thieves, murderers, all these kind of vicious things to happen in
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.900]   this world?
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.980]   He says, "This is a problem."
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.560]   And I always say, "You know, I'm not going to get all philosophical on you.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   Some scholars do.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.260]   They're like, 'You know, in all possible universes, this is the best possible…'"
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.060]   No, I'm not going to talk about that.
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.900]   You know what I'm going to say to you?
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.540]   God has an easy, easy answer for you.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.260]   Just wait a little bit.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.780]   It'll be all good.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.020]   Every wicked person who has said one wicked thing is going to be punished.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.660]   There is not a wicked thought you're going to get away with.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:40.860]   To a meticulous degree, for every detail of ungodliness in this world, I am going to punish.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.820]   Have you ever read the book of Revelation?
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.740]   It's scary, right?
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.820]   The problem of evil is not a problem of evil.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.820]   It's just a problem of time.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.820]   That's it.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.380]   You just wait.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:02.980]   Do you understand when the Lord says, "Time is up," all forms of wickedness will be punished.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.020]   Turn in your Bibles to 2 Peter chapter 3.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.580]   Take a moment, please, to turn in your Bibles to 2 Peter chapter 3.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:19.100]   And Apostle Peter explains to everyone the concept of wickedness, the concept of patience,
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.980]   and what in the world is God doing with all that.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.260]   Okay?
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.220]   So 2 Peter chapter 3.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.580]   He says this, starting from verse 3.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.660]   So 2 Peter chapter 3, verse 3.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.580]   Knowing this, first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing,
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.580]   following their own sinful desires.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.740]   They'll say, "Where is the promise of his coming?
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.540]   For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.360]   beginning of creation.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.540]   For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.900]   earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, and that by means
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.780]   of these, the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished."
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   What is he saying?
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.020]   Don't you guys forget God is able to judge all wickedness.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.380]   He's done it before.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.620]   And then he says, verse 7, "But by the same word of the heavens and earth that now exist
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:21.780]   are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:28.460]   But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is a thousand years,
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.700]   and a thousand years as one day.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.020]   The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness, but is patient towards
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.860]   you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.340]   But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:50.740]   roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and the works
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:55.180]   that are done on it will be exposed."
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:33:03.660]   See, Asaph's initial complaint is, "God, do you even see this stuff?"
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.500]   Did you guys notice earlier, it's like, "How will God even know all this stuff is happening?"
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.260]   No.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:17.260]   The reality is God is going to expose every single evil and sin, and he's gonna judge
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.340]   it.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.740]   He's just giving us time to repent.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.260]   That's it.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.180]   And the kind of judgment that's going to come is so scary.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:32.020]   People are going to literally run, people are gonna in feebleness try to hide underneath
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:37.160]   rocks, and they're going to wish they were crushed to death by the earth before they
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.540]   face the wrath of God.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.820]   That's an incredible thing.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:49.540]   So what happens is when Asaph walks into God's temple, he realizes, "God sees everything.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.160]   God is going to judge."
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:56.920]   And as soon as he does that, he opens his eyes, and just like before, he looked out,
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.340]   and then he looked in.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.420]   Initially he looked out, and he said, "What?
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.420]   They have it so good."
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.660]   And then he looked in, he's like, "Oh, look at me.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.140]   My life sucks."
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.780]   But now that his eyes are open, he looked, and he's like, "Oh my gosh, they're gonna
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.860]   die."
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:15.780]   And then he looked at himself, and he realized, "I'm actually not so much different."
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.100]   The next thing he sees is he sees his own heart.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.500]   Take a look at verse 21 through 24.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:28.480]   So go back in your Bibles to Psalm 73, and take a look at verse 21 through 24.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:35.460]   This is what he says, "When my heart was embittered, I was pierced within.
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.980]   Then I was senseless, and I was ignorant, and I was like a beast before you.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.740]   Nevertheless, I'm continually with you, and you have taken hold of my right hand."
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.460]   Do you see what he's saying?
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:52.780]   This he realizes, like, "Dude, God is in control, and the extent of his control is
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.580]   massive, and he's gonna judge every single wickedness that's on this earth."
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.580]   He quickly looks at himself, he's like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.740]   What in the world was I saying?
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.340]   I was like a bumbling fool."
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.380]   Can I take my words back?
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.860]   There's just a moment of just regret, like, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe I even said
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.460]   that stuff.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.700]   I was like a beast."
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:19.420]   He describes himself as having a bitter heart, and you guys have all probably experienced
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:25.980]   at one point or another, when you are bitter, you are not arguing reasonably.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.980]   You're just sour.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:32.100]   You're not arguing based on truth.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.900]   When you're bitter, all you see is red.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.500]   When you're bitter, you've already gone far past trying to evaluate.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.660]   You've gone far past just simply judging.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:47.220]   You're a bitter individual who will not be appeased until you have justice.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:52.860]   See, at that moment, if you're bitter, you're already way too far.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:58.220]   And so Asaph says, "Oh, once I look at my heart, I'm pierced.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.540]   I was senseless.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.420]   I was ignorant."
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.140]   He has the humility.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:13.580]   He has the humility to say that, yes, although in his human eyes, it doesn't seem fair.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:18.420]   Why is it that they're so selfish, and yet you keep calling me to be selfless?
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.020]   It doesn't seem fair at all.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.720]   And maybe he feels hurt by that.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.580]   Maybe he feels disgruntled by that.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:29.140]   And yet he has the humility to say, "I was wrong.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.540]   Absolutely wrong."
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.260]   And remember, remember that in verse one, he says, "God is supposed to be good to the
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.620]   pure in heart, and that now is being examined."
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:47.700]   God, I'm going to have the humility for your presence to examine even that statement.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.540]   I falsely assumed I was pure in heart.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.420]   You guys get that?
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.100]   "God, that's not fair.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.140]   You're supposed to be good to Israel because Israel is your people, and you're supposed
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.820]   to be good to people who are good.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.460]   Why do good people suffer?"
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:09.140]   And then he stops and thinks, "I made a massive presumption, Lord.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.020]   I presume my heart was already pure before you.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.580]   But as I look inside, I have envy.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.580]   As I look inside, I have greed.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:25.100]   Truthfully speaking, I was jealous, and truthfully speaking, I was judgmental."
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:31.340]   He is open to the scrutiny of God, and then he confesses, "I was like an animal.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.140]   I'm like a beast."
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.740]   Had this knee-jerk reaction, right?
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.580]   I saw something and I spoke.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.900]   Why does he call himself a beast?
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:46.380]   It's because instinctually, animals work on impulse.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.180]   They're hungry, blah, right?
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.180]   They feel cornered.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.660]   They lash out.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.660]   And so he says, "I was like a beast."
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:38:02.140]   Brothers and sisters, can we model ourselves after this kind of humility Asaph is showing
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.060]   us?
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.660]   He recognizes that he was judging things based on his sight, and now he has the humility
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.540]   to confess, "That's what I did."
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:18.340]   If you sit and you start defending yourself, "No, God, I have every right to be pissed."
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.340]   Why?
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.180]   Because look, that's not right.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.900]   What you're going to be guilty of, you're going to be guilty of pointing your finger
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:32.380]   up at God and saying, "God, you're either incapable or you don't care for justice."
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.420]   Or you're going to point the finger at God and you're going to say, "God, maybe you are
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.420]   just.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.420]   God, maybe...
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.420]   Sorry.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:45.180]   Maybe you see that my only conclusion is you don't love me."
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.340]   Have you or anybody you've known gone there?
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.180]   I'm pretty sure, right?
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.460]   I can't sit here and attack you and say, "God, you're not just."
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.580]   You can't do that because the Bible is chock full of that.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.740]   If you said that, people are like, "Oh."
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.740]   Right?
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.740]   "God, you don't see.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.340]   Maybe you don't have eyes to see this stuff."
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.500]   You can't say that.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.940]   But then maybe you start doubting.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:13.620]   Well, then maybe you don't care.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.380]   Maybe you don't love me.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:23.780]   If you're there, man, there is no kind of depression like believing that the God of
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:29.620]   the universe, who is the definition of love, does not love you.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.100]   Right?
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:37.340]   Like, I feel for you because that's an incredible kind of pain that no human is going to come
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.860]   next to you and be like, "It's all right, man."
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.860]   If you believe the lie, "God doesn't love me.
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.460]   He sees my pain and yet he doesn't care," that's the kind of depression no human is
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.500]   able to pull you out of.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.580]   So I want to share with you today that God does love you.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.460]   And what Asaph says is incredible.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:03.140]   Take a look at verse 23 to 26.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.140]   He says, "I was like a beast before you."
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.140]   Right?
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.140]   That was the end of verse 22.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.140]   However, verse 23.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:15.340]   "Nevertheless, I am continually with you.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.980]   You have taken hold of my right hand.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.220]   With your counsel, you guide me.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.860]   Afterward, receive me to glory.
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:27.280]   Whom have I in heaven but you and beside you, I desire nothing on earth.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:35.860]   My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.980]   Those are some of the most beautiful passages in Scripture.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.020]   Do you see the picture?
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.380]   You've got this beast like, right?
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.380]   I see there's all this wickedness in the world and this beast is sitting there before God
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.380]   like, "How dare you, Lord?"
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.420]   And he's got this finger pointing.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.940]   What are you doing about this?
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.420]   And God comes over and he takes the hand and he guides him.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.980]   Do you see the picture?
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.740]   When you try to picture the Scriptures, it's amazing.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.620]   Would you do that?
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.260]   Some little flea looking at you like, "Look at you, God, what are you doing?"
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.660]   You would just be like...
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.060]   Immediately backhand.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:24.460]   But God takes that accusatory finger, holds the hand, and guides him, loves him, and says,
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.100]   "You have me."
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.380]   That's the love of God.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.100]   It's astounding.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.220]   He says, "God, you're with me.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.940]   Your counsel's with me."
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.900]   And then he says this beautiful thing, "You receive me to your glory."
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.260]   Did you catch that in verse 24?
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.700]   It's like he takes it here, he takes it there, and he takes it to the top.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.660]   "You receive me to your glory."
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:52.660]   That's so crazy.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.820]   I want to challenge you right now.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:00.140]   Have you experienced that kind of love in your life?
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.180]   Because that's the Christian faith, isn't it?
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.260]   Christian faith is not a doctrinal system.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.260]   You guys have heard this before.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.980]   Christian faith is not, "Oh, I think, you know, like Jehovah's Witness, and then Mormonism,
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:22.700]   Catholicism, and then Christianity, I compared it, and this doctrinal system really works."
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.980]   That's not Christianity.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:32.740]   Christianity is, you were an evil person with evil desires engaged in evil deeds, and God
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:37.300]   just lavished this little being with grace.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:44.340]   And then you felt this massive load of love come to you, and you're forever changed.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.900]   Yes?
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.140]   Have you felt that?
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.900]   That's to you everything.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.660]   Only then can you say, "Give me more of that.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.740]   Take away the world.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.220]   I may have nothing in this life.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:06.100]   I may have nothing in this world, but my portion is full because God has filled my life."
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.860]   Let me ask another way.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:13.220]   Not just simply have you felt the love of God, but in some weird, odd way, have you
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:22.500]   drifted from the Lord, where this teaching, "Brothers and sisters, the Lord loves you,"
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.980]   does it not feel any different?
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:31.740]   Any different than, let's say, if a random stranger came to you and said, "What's wrong,
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.740]   buddy?
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   You sad?
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.740]   It's okay, man.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.660]   I love you."
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.260]   Does it feel the same way?
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.260]   Let me ask another way.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.500]   Does God's love to you feel like some kind of weird consolation prize?
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.140]   "Thanks for participating in this game.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.660]   That guy won the reward.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.940]   But at least for you, we have participation trophy."
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.660]   Does God's love feel like that for you?
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:02.300]   Where you hear the words like the Lord of the universe who created you, who sustains
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:08.780]   everything that has breath, He loves you, and yet all it feels like is some kind of
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.140]   consolation prize?
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:14.580]   I'm going to be honest.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:19.820]   There are moments in our lives where perhaps it may feel like that.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.140]   But we have to really check our hearts.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   Asaph, for him, the reality that absolutely changed everything.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:33.980]   Oh my goodness, I have God, right?
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:39.940]   I may not have the dream of Orange County Christianity where I have a three-bedroom
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:44.420]   house with 2.5 bathrooms because you got to have that .5 bathroom for guests.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.180]   I've got 2.5 kids because three is too many.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:51.100]   I've got 2.5 cars and three cars in the garage, like whatever it may be, right?
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.460]   I may not have that.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.460]   I got everything.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:59.140]   I've got God.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:04.420]   That's the reality where it has radically changed Asaph's life.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:09.860]   And if you can't get there and it feels weird, I want to challenge you right now.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:16.780]   How have you drifted where the Lord's presence is not enough?
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:22.140]   What has gripped your heart so much you want it so bad where someone says,
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.980]   "But you have God," and you're like, "I get it.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.220]   I have God, but I don't have this yet."
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:28.420]   Right?
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.420]   Is it the job?
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.380]   Like what good is God's love?
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.260]   I don't have a job right now.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:39.460]   If that's your words, you got to come to the Lord in repentance.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:45.180]   What has so gripped your soul where the love of God is not enough?
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.620]   Remember, brothers and sisters, that our Christian faith, again,
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.540]   is not a religious system, is not a doctrinal system.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.260]   It is an access to God Almighty.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:01.460]   Christ died on the cross, tore the veil, and he became the high priest of all to
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.140]   bring you to God.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.620]   End game.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:10.740]   To bring you to his eternal presence forever.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.180]   God was not in the business of trying to make you succeed.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.420]   "Oh, I know life is hard.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.780]   I just want to get you from one-year-old to 80-year-old."
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.220]   That is not God's dream.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.620]   He wants to give you eternity with Christ.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:32.980]   He wants to give you eternity with him as your loving father and you as his child.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:39.020]   Lastly, once Asaph started to realize that, look, once Asaph started to realize,
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.020]   "Oh, my goodness, look at them people."
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.540]   Initially, he said, "They have it so good."
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.020]   And then he looked at God and he was like, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.620]   God's about to pour out his wrath.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.940]   They're doomed."
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.100]   He looked at himself like, "Oh, my gosh.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.540]   My heart wanted that.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.620]   I'm like wicked inside.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.020]   I'm not pure."
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:57.220]   Right?
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.660]   That's what he's saying.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.340]   And then he realizes, "Oh, my gosh.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.460]   Why did I want that stuff?
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.460]   I have God."
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.260]   And then now he comes to a point where he redefines everything.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.180]   He redefines what is good.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.140]   Verse 26 through 28, we're going to finish off here.
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.980]   Go in your Bibles and take a look.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.980]   Psalm 73 of 26 to 28 says, "My flesh and my heart may fail,
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.740]   but God is my strength."
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.380]   That is a redefining of life.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.180]   What's my strength?
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:26.740]   My money?
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:26.980]   No.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.980]   What's my strength?
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.980]   My skills.
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.220]   No, it's not your skills, right?
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.140]   It's my job title.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.220]   It's not your job title.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.820]   That is not your strength.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:38.060]   When he realizes by faith, God is my strength.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.780]   He's the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.100]   For behold, those who are far from you will perish.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:49.340]   He realizes far from God means destruction, close to God means life.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.980]   You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.780]   But as for me, highlight this, you guys.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:59.620]   Star it, underline it, do whatever you can to memorize this.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:05.420]   For me, the nearness of God is my good.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.140]   That's Christianity in a nutshell.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:17.500]   I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell of all your works.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.940]   Wow, that is the beautiful reality.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.820]   That's the beautiful reality that Asaph have come to conclusion.
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.020]   That's his judgment now.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:34.260]   I may be poor, but I'm good, right?
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.300]   Can you say that?
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:40.900]   You may not have the perfect family, but I'm good.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.020]   I'm full.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.900]   And the devil may come as like, "Look at this new phone.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.420]   Look at this new gadget.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:51.060]   Look at this better house, better car, better everything.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:53.020]   Look at the freedom you can have.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.140]   You don't have to worry anymore."
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.260]   Dude, I'm good.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:03.220]   How do you fight the temptation of the enemy?
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:08.660]   When you recognize who you have in God and you use the new mechanism,
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:13.140]   a new definitive standard, the standard by which I'm going to say,
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.020]   "My life sucks," versus, "My life is good," is no longer the video I saw
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.940]   on YouTube, is no longer the guy who's traveling the world.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.420]   My standard is the presence of God.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.540]   That to me is my good.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.860]   That's the Christian faith.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.820]   Prosperity, shalom, peace.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.100]   That doesn't come with you being able to sell yourself.
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.780]   That doesn't come with you being able to market, take photos of all that you've
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.100]   been doing in life.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:48.700]   It comes with you being absolutely content in God.
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:55.300]   Now, I want to wrap up and review these four things in a kind of comedic way
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.780]   because I want to talk about maturity.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.460]   A lot of times when I speak in front of our church, many of you have been
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:06.780]   Christians for a long time, 20 years, more.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.860]   These aren't things that you haven't heard before.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.060]   So I want to challenge you, are you maturing?
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:18.300]   And the way I want to review this is by saying, ladies in the room who are
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:22.340]   single, because a family retreat is happening and there's a bunch of you here,
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.900]   okay?
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.340]   I like to give free dating advice and that dating advice is,
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.980]   "How can you tell if the man you are interested in is a mature man?"
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.060]   Well, let me tell you the difference.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:41.180]   Ladies, a mature man is going to have a vision that is a holistic Christian
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.820]   worldview, meaning he's going to see clearly.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:50.260]   A kid is going to have tunnel vision and he can't see the pain coming, right?
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:54.260]   When you see a little kid, it's like, "God, you're going to get hurt," right?
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.780]   That's a child.
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:59.020]   Mature individual sees the end game.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:03.060]   What's more, a mature man can humbly judge his own desires.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.780]   You know what?
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.340]   I got a weird, like, "I love the Lord, but I love myself."
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.100]   I got this weird pride as like, "I boast in Jesus, but I want to boast in myself,"
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:15.700]   and they have a humility that's open, right?
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.860]   A child, he can't see nothing but his own impulses.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.500]   He doesn't work off of humble evaluation.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.860]   He just, "I see it, I do it," right?
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:28.700]   He thinks it's great, but that's just a child.
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:34.700]   A man who is mature has a perspective that recognizes what's good.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.340]   He values God because it's good.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.700]   He values a good woman because it's good in God's eyes.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:44.020]   He knows the difference between this is a jewel of God versus this is not.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:47.500]   A child, a kid, all he knows is what he wants.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.580]   That's all he sees and he's not happy until he gets it.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:55.300]   A mature man is already secure.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:52:00.180]   He's found where to be content in God.
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:03.900]   If a kid is sitting there like, "Oh, I don't have what I want," right?
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.460]   He's always disheveled.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:06.820]   "I don't have my life."
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:12.340]   You know, and then, typically, an insecure individual will look at you as the source
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.940]   of his security.
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:17.140]   When you see that, it all fits together.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:21.300]   He doesn't know who he has, he doesn't have a vision of his own heart,
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:26.660]   and typically, his vision is short-sighted.
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:32.620]   For us, by way of conclusion, this to us is not just simply a nutshell
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.340]   of Christianity.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.860]   This to you, for those of you who have been Christian for a long time,
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.660]   is also your maturity.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.060]   Let's pray.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:58.420]   Lord God, today, Lord, through this beautiful song written by Asaph,
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.980]   we see the wrestle of the heart.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:06.020]   And God, although maybe we might not be able to sympathize or relate in every
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:13.380]   single way, we confess, God, some of these things are real and near temptations.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:17.660]   I ask, Lord, that your spirit would convict us and cause us to grow in faith
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:24.660]   to the degree where we see you, we see you clearly and accurately,
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:29.260]   and that our hearts would follow and to love you and desire you
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.740]   above everything else.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:36.060]   God, we will confess, Lord, nothing in this world satisfies,
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:42.380]   nothing in this world lasts, not anybody else and definitely not ourselves.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:48.260]   But Father God, you are eternal, and only you can be the full provision
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.900]   of our hearts.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.340]   And so, God, we thank you that in your love, you give yourself to us.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.940]   It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
