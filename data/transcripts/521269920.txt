[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11 verses 30 and 31.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.720]   Okay, Hebrews chapter 11 verse 30 and 31.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.760]   So we're going much faster.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.760]   Two verses today.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.480]   Chapter 11 verse 30 and 31.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:54.800]   Heavenly Father, we pray for greater insight, greater knowledge of Christ and what He has
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.600]   done, that all that we do may simply be a reasonable response to your great mercy.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.280]   Lord, as we continue to study your redemptive history and the examples that have gone before
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.440]   us, help us, Lord God, not to simply take it as knowledge, but the source of strength
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   for application in our lives, to put our confidence and trust in you and you alone.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.000]   So we pray for your grace and your Holy Spirit to lead and guide us through your word.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Amen.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.720]   All right, so now we're jumping into the next great event that took place.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.240]   40 years have gone by since they've come out of Egypt, and so we're skipping literally
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.520]   from Exodus chapter 14, 15, and we're just speeding through Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.360]   Deuteronomy, and then now we're at the event that takes place in Joshua.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.040]   And so, but before we jump into this text in verse 30 and 31, I wanted to remind us
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.180]   of how we got to chapter 11 so that we can understand this in the proper context, okay?
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.480]   So if you remember, the whole book of Hebrews is written to a group of people who have been
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.940]   drifting from their faith.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.680]   So they've been tempted.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.520]   In the very beginning of their faith, they were celebrating their love for Christ and
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.320]   they were fellowshipping with those who were being imprisoned, and so it was a very strong
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.700]   church, but at some point, maybe after 10, 20, 30 years, the persecution was intensified,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.120]   and so many of them started drifting back to their old life, to the Judaistic life.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.780]   And so the remedy for that for the author is to remind them of the supremacy of Christ.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.320]   So we had chapter 10, 10 chapters of talking about how Jesus Christ is better than everything
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   that they value.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.720]   He's better than the angels, better than Moses, better than the prophets, better than
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.840]   the priests, and he's a greater sacrifice.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.080]   So that's what he's been talking about.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.880]   He's been laying out Christology to demonstrate to them that this great salvation that we
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.640]   have in Christ, that if we neglect such a great salvation, how much more deserving of
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.140]   judgment would we have?
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.000]   So we had 11 chapters of, or 10 chapters of Christology.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.840]   When we get to chapter 12 and chapter 13, it's the application of those 10 chapters.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.420]   If we truly believe that Christ is supreme over everything else, then this is how we
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.420]   ought to live.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.860]   So chapter 12 and chapter 13, there's a lot of imperatives teaching us instructions on
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.440]   what we ought to do.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.500]   Chapter 11 is right in the middle where he's transitioning from the indicatives to the
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.200]   imperatives, where he's teaching us this is who Jesus is.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.280]   And if he truly is supreme over everything that we value, then we ought to live this
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   way.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.100]   And so chapter 11 is, he's saying, but that gap is because of faith, by faith.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.920]   So everything that we've been talking about in chapter 11, that if you believe this, chapter
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.560]   1 through 10, then you will do this.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.960]   And here's some examples of some people who by faith have done this, by faith have done
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   that.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.260]   And so it's important for us to recognize that I think every one of us have a tendency.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.160]   Some of us are more prone to action, and so we don't have a lot of patience for the theological
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   aspect.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.440]   We just want to, teach me the basics and then tell me what to do.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   I want to get to work.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.640]   I want to do something practical.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.880]   So we kind of leave our theology at a kind of superficial or at a basic level, and then
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.160]   we want to get to work.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   Or we may have a tendency to be on the other end, where we're so into like, we want to
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.480]   know biblical theology.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.960]   We want to know all the systematic theology.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.600]   We want to know exegesis.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.640]   And then when it comes to the application, we don't pay as much attention to that.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.120]   Well, chapter 11 really is the core of our Christian faith, where it's not one or the
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   other.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.520]   Both part is just as crucial.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.880]   Is by faith, is what we believe, not just a superficial fundamental, Jesus loves you,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.280]   died for you, was resurrected.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.340]   So now let's get to work.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.760]   By faith reminds us that everything that he says in 11 chapters, 10 chapters, is just
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.040]   as crucial as what we do, because that's the foundation.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.560]   That's the motivation.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   That's the strength.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.020]   That's the reason why we do what we do.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.360]   If you're running and doing something and you forget why you're doing that, eventually
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.280]   you're going to get burned out.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.480]   So it's by faith, faith is the fuel.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.120]   The action that they took is because they had the right faith.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.880]   So again, I wanted to revisit that before we jump into this, because we want to ask
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.520]   the question, what are we to learn from this?
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.360]   And obviously we have the same theme that's kind of going through all of it is that this
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.040]   is God's redemptive history.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.040]   He's being faithful to his promise.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.120]   And through the ups and downs of Israel's history, that you remain, God remains faithful
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.840]   throughout the whole thing.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.200]   There's two questions that we want to answer here.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   First of it is in verse 30, when it says, "By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.640]   after they had been encircled for seven days," how come Joshua's name is not mentioned here?
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.760]   I mean, he's the central figure in what's going on here.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.700]   So up to this point, we've had, "By faith, Abraham did this.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.120]   By faith, Jacob did this.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.240]   By faith, Isaac did this.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.360]   By faith, Joseph did this."
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.640]   But when we come to the falling of the wall of Jericho, Joshua is the central figure in
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.520]   this and his name is not mentioned.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.560]   We get to verse 31, and it says, "By faith, Rahab the harlot did not perish along with
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.440]   those who were disobedient after she had welcomed the spies in peace."
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.800]   Why is Rahab's name mentioned here?
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.400]   This great event that takes place through Joshua, this man of faith, and his name is
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.360]   not mentioned, and the person that is highlighted in the conquering of Jericho is Rahab the
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.720]   harlot.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.240]   Why is her name here?
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.480]   So the two questions.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.960]   Why is Joshua's name not here and why is Rahab's name not here?
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.880]   And again, whenever we do inductive Bible study, it's very important to ask a lot of
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.440]   questions because if you don't ask questions, you won't know when you get the answer.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.640]   So people who ask a lot of questions are usually the ones who end up learning.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.560]   If you come in and I have no questions, it just means even when something profound comes
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.920]   up, you're not really going to catch it because you didn't really search.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.440]   And so again, you get in the habit when we are studying the scripture to ask a lot of
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.440]   questions.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.220]   And so again, what we're saying about Joshua's name and Rahab's name is not the central
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.740]   thing that we're going to be talking about, but it is going to help us to see why it is
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.920]   written in this way.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.540]   Before we get into it, I think we need to understand the background context behind,
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.160]   before they go into Jericho, what exactly happened.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.220]   For 40 years, they come out and that history of 40 years, there's a lot of things that
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.680]   happened during those 40 years.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.260]   Remember, they got the law, they built the tabernacle, spies went and they came back
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.840]   and they were afraid and as a result, they wandered in the desert for 40 years.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.740]   And so Moses was a leader during those 40 years, right?
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.780]   Reluctant leader, but he was a good leader.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:23.260]   And but right before they are about to face their biggest challenge, up to now for 40
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.280]   years, all they had to do was when God said to move, you move.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.680]   God said to sit down, you sit down.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.460]   He said, you touch this, then you touch.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.780]   God says, don't touch it, you don't touch it.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.420]   You just have to do exactly what he had, he got told him to do.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.500]   But they were wandering in the desert.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.740]   So it wasn't like there was some, some, you know, enemies waiting to ambush them every
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.860]   corner.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.180]   But this was the real test.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:51.020]   The first time they needed to go against a fortified city.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:58.020]   God takes Moses out, this great leader out, and he puts this inexperienced leader, Joshua,
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.820]   to lead this church.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.980]   So if you are a military commander, it's a bad time to do this.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.180]   God didn't, in fact, when God removed Moses, like again, to this day, I'm not exactly sure
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.420]   what Moses did, other than God says, you didn't show me as holy.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.060]   So I've combed through that passage.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.820]   I've heard sermons, read through commentaries.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.820]   And to be honest, I don't really understand other than he hit the rock.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.820]   Right?
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.260]   And I've heard whole sermons and, you know, exposition about what that hitting the rock
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.060]   meant and why he shouldn't have done that.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.020]   It's like, I'm not convinced.
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.020]   Right?
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:38.420]   I don't know exactly what he did, but what God said was, whatever it was, he didn't present
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.020]   God the way God wanted to be presented.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.780]   He misrepresented God to Israel.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.780]   And as a result of that, he couldn't get into the promised land.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.980]   So Moses actually is begging God, like, please, look at that land filled with milk and honey.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.300]   I've been waiting 40 years.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.940]   I told you I didn't want to do this, but here's the payoff.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.460]   But he couldn't get in.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.980]   So there was no transitional time for Joshua to learn the trades and Moses to disciple
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.340]   him and raise him up as a leader.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.340]   There was none of that.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.860]   You switch him out, Joshua gets plugged in.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.660]   And then they cross the Jordan River.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.500]   And in order to get to the promised land, they face their biggest challenge.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.380]   Here's this fortified city.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:28.020]   And in fact, this is how God describes the nation of Israel, who they're up against.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.020]   Deuteronomy 9, 1 through 7.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.620]   Here, O Israel, you are crossing over the Jordan today to go into a dispensation of
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.420]   nations greater and mightier than you.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.420]   They're all greater and mightier than you.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.420]   Right?
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.660]   It's a great pep talk.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:50.060]   Great cities fortified to heaven, a people great and tall, sons of Anakim, whom you know
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:57.300]   and of whom you have heard it said, who can stand before the sons of Anak?
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.340]   I mean, I don't think God even needed to remind them.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.220]   They knew what they were up against, but God made it sure that they understood.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.260]   You're going against a fortified city.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.280]   They have a reputation of being great.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.180]   They're bigger than you.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.180]   They're taller than you.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.340]   The only thing I don't mention is they're better looking than you.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.020]   It's almost like he's deliberately trying to discourage them.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:29.000]   And you have to remember the experienced adults among the Israelites, what happened to them?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.460]   They all died out.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.460]   Right?
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.820]   So not only do they have a young commanding leader who doesn't have experience, anybody
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.220]   who's older and more mature already died out.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.620]   So it's all the kids from that generation, brand new, are going into the city.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.500]   And then right before they go, God says, they're better than you.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.420]   They're stronger than you.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.440]   You know, and they've been wandering out in the desert.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.900]   These guys aren't trained soldiers.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.340]   All they know how to do is march.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.000]   They know how to carry that box.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.820]   They're good at carrying that box.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.880]   Right?
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.620]   God tells you to sit, you sit.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.620]   He tells you to get up, you get up.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.820]   That's what they've been doing, basic training for 40 years.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.940]   So it's kind of like getting a bunch of soldiers who've been doing basic training, and then
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.800]   the biggest battle, right?
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.180]   And then they give a brand new commander, it's like, go!
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.140]   By the way, they have better weapons than you.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.260]   They have a reputation of this army.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.440]   They've destroyed everybody else before you, right?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.440]   Why is he saying that?
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.640]   Well, he says in verse 3, Deuteronomy 9, 3, "Know therefore today that it is the Lord
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.540]   your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire."
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:46.060]   In other words, if you're going in there with any kind of self-confidence, right, by human
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.740]   standards, they'll destroy you.
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.140]   And that's why I want to let you know, it is not you.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.300]   I'm not sending you in, I'm going in.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.420]   I just want you to follow me.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.260]   The Lord your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire, he will destroy them,
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.020]   and he will subdue them before you so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly,
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.800]   just as the Lord has spoken to you.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.820]   And then he goes on even further in verse 4.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.660]   And I want you to see how many times he says to them, "Remember that it is not because
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.860]   of your righteousness that this is happening."
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.800]   Verse 4, "Do not say in your heart when the Lord your God has driven them out before you,
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.900]   because of my righteousness the Lord has brought men to possess this land.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.740]   But it is because of the weakness of their nations that the Lord is possessing them before
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:34.740]   you.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.940]   It is not your righteousness, for your uprightness of your heart, that you are going to possess
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.940]   this land.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.460]   But it is because of the weakness of these nations, the Lord your God is driving them
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.180]   out before you, in order to confirm the oath which the Lord swore to your fathers, Abraham,
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.740]   Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.180]   Know then it is not because of your righteousness that the Lord your God giving you this good
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.260]   land to possess, for you are a stubborn people."
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.660]   You kind of get the idea that maybe God was concerned that they're going to become proud,
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.860]   right?
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.100]   That they're going to have such an easy time conquering this fortified city that at the
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.260]   end of that they're going to come out thinking like, "We must have done something right."
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.460]   Right?
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.300]   Maybe it's because all this marching strengthened their legs.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.300]   You know?
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.900]   It must have been something, he said.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.540]   But he wanted to make sure.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:28.660]   And the reason why he wanted to make sure is because our tendency to become proud when
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.380]   things go well.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.300]   And that was their fault.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.220]   When they were the strongest was when they were completely dependent upon God.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.220]   How could they have possibly thought that they came out of Egypt by their own strength?
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.540]   How can they have possibly thought they would have survived in the desert?
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.060]   The water and the food that they ate was miraculous food.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.180]   Right?
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.740]   Normal people would have just died within months with no food, no water.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.140]   God was providing for them.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.820]   But just in case you forgot, I'm not sending you into this city to conquer them because
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.060]   I've done enough training and you guys, we have a bunch of trained people who are able
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:12.500]   to fight and we strengthened you, we worked on your arms and your legs, we worked on strategy.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.500]   And so when we get over there, that we're going to put all that to use.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.460]   He said, "No.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.460]   They're bigger than you.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.620]   They're stronger than you.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.140]   They're mightier than you.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.500]   So make sure when you get over there that you realize I'm going over and you follow
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.740]   me.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.580]   And just in case after it's done, it is not because of your righteousness.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.940]   Not only are they greater than you, you're not righteous."
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.160]   He goes even further than that, verse seven, "Remember, do not forget how you provoke the
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.720]   Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.620]   From the day that you left the land of Egypt until you arrived at this place, you have
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.620]   been rebellious against the Lord."
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.140]   He says, "If you have any confidence thinking like, 'Oh, during the 40 years, maybe that's,
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.540]   you know, we've been good and that's why God is giving us this land.'"
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.300]   He said, "You forgot already what the 40 years was like."
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.300]   Right?
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.180]   Remember the 40 years?
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:07.860]   Right off, right before they even crossed the Red Sea, right?
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.020]   They started grumbling.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.820]   "You brought us out here to kill us here?
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.180]   It would have been better to go to Egypt."
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.780]   They crossed to the other side and they get a little thirsty.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:20.900]   "You brought us out here where there's no water?"
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.780]   Then a little bit later, they get hungry.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.780]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, you brought us out here with no food?
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.420]   God gives a miraculous manna from heaven."
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:35.020]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, you brought us out here to eat the same bread over and over?"
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.620]   So God gives him quail and he eats the quail.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:41.340]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, the same thing over and over again?"
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.900]   If there's anything in 40 years, remember how many times you provoke the Lord.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:53.660]   So just in case that you think that somehow you deserve this, it's not because of your
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:59.820]   righteousness, it's not because of your strength, it's not because they're weaker than you,
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.820]   it's because I'm going ahead.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.500]   He said, "Because the promise I made to your forefathers."
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.540]   He's being faithful to himself.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.140]   The covenant that he has made, he is keeping it.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.700]   He says again in Deuteronomy 7, 7-9, "The Lord did not set his love on you nor chose
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.060]   you because you were more in number than any of the people.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.860]   For you were the fewest of all the peoples, but because the Lord loved you and kept the
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.740]   oath which he swore to the forefathers, the Lord brought you out by a mighty hand and
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.340]   redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:41.780]   Know therefore that the Lord your God, he is God, the faithful God who keeps his covenant
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:47.540]   and his loving kindness to the thousands generation and to those with those who love him and keep
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.980]   his commandments."
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:57.180]   You know the mystery of our salvation isn't that somehow God has seen a diamond in the
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.180]   rough.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.060]   You know, every once in a while I hear somebody saying that.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:05.900]   There's something in us that God saw that maybe even we didn't see and therefore he
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.620]   chose, right?
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.340]   The diamond in the rough and he polished us and he made us as great people.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:18.660]   Which means that the non-Christians were not worth saving because there was something special
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.660]   about us.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.140]   It's us that God saw.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.260]   And he says no.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.300]   The fundamental question is he just chose to love us.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.380]   It's not because of your righteousness.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.580]   In fact, if you're honest with yourself, right?
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.160]   If you're honest with yourself, we're not even talking about before you became a Christian.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.940]   We're talking about after you became a Christian.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:47.540]   Do you really think you've lived up to the calling of what God has given you?
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:53.340]   Don't answer that because I don't want to refute you, right?
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.620]   How many of you, including myself, after we've been a Christian, whether you've been a Christian
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:05.340]   a year or 30 years or 40 years or 50 years, look back on this 30, 40, 50 years of our
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.780]   Christian life and say, "You know what?
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.180]   I know I was an unfaithful person, you know, didn't know God.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:18.900]   But after I became a Christian, majority of my life was lived in obedience.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.820]   Majority of my thoughts, my human relationships was faithful.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.460]   I lived up to the gospel that the Bible talks.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.940]   I've lived up to the calling that God has given me."
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.700]   How many of you can confidently say that?
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:40.380]   My guess is if you're honest with yourself, you have memories year after year after year
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:47.660]   struggling with certain sins, with anger, bitterness, maybe pride.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.700]   All these things that we can think of and we probably feel more unworthy today than
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.900]   we did when we first met Christ.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:05.380]   The fundamental questions of the gospel isn't, "Why did God punish the sinners?"
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.860]   That answer is pretty easy, right?
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.060]   Because they rebelled against him.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.420]   He's God.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.620]   Why wouldn't he punish them?
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.620]   If somebody irritates you, do you not punish them?
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.940]   Somebody slaps you, do you not slap them back?
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.960]   Or at least that's your temptation, right?
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.540]   So we know why rebellious people get punished.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.140]   The question is, "Why did he love us?"
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.580]   So when Jesus comes, I don't think the first question that we should be asking is, "Why
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.740]   did you create hell?
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.780]   Why is there so much suffering in the world?"
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.580]   The answer is clear, because mankind, all of sin, falls short of the glory of God.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.700]   But the question that remains a mystery, and I'm not sure exactly if it's going to make
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:55.060]   sense even after we die when we meet Christ, is, "Why did you choose us?
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.300]   Why were we chosen?
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.300]   What did we do?"
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.180]   It really isn't a clear answer, other than the fact he said, "He chose you, and he chose
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.580]   to love you, and he's being faithful to his covenant promise."
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:16.220]   See, he wanted Israel to make sure that they believe, because the moment we stray from
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:21.700]   that, and we begin to think to ourselves that, "Maybe I was bad before, but maybe if I'm
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.700]   good afterwards," and that's the difference between a good Christian and a bad Christian,
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.660]   or somebody who bears fruit, somebody who doesn't bear fruit, is somebody who works
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:34.260]   hard versus somebody who doesn't work hard.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.260]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.060]   Does the Bible tell us to pick up the cross?
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.060]   Yes.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.420]   Does the Bible tell us, like Paul said, "I buffet my body and make it my slave, after
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.700]   I preach to others that I may be disqualified?"
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.820]   Yes.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.140]   Does the Bible tell us to sacrifice?
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.140]   Yes.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:53.980]   All those things are true, but the fundamental place where the gospel brings us, always,
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:59.820]   past, present, and future, is absolute helplessness before God.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.340]   Because our battle is not against flesh and blood.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:11.740]   You can't get into a demonic wrestling match by working hard.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:20.060]   You can't change the Spirit's work by being smart, by being determined.
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.140]   Remember the Corinthians?
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.740]   There's a church that really was battling each other for righteousness.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.220]   And so the church started splitting because they said, "In order to be really righteous
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.260]   and right with God, you need to have the right leader."
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.820]   So some were saying, "I follow Apollo," some saying, "Paul," some being, "Peter."
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.780]   And it was causing all kinds of divisions.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.180]   And then Paul is trying to remind them that division is coming because of your spiritual
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.820]   pride.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.940]   That somehow, some of you think you're more righteous because you've stood in the right
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.340]   line.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.100]   Some of you think you're more righteous because you have the right training, or whatever it
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.780]   is that you think you are.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.780]   And Paul comes in and he says, "For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.420]   many wise according to the flesh."
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.060]   I want you to think about what he's saying here, okay?
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.260]   In other words, you weren't wise.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.020]   Not many were mighty.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.740]   You weren't mighty.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.100]   Not many were noble.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.720]   You weren't noble.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.180]   But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, in other words, you were foolish, to
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.180]   shame the wise.
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.500]   And God has chosen the weak things of the world, in other words, you are weak, to shame
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.260]   the things that are strong and the base things of the world, the most fundamental.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.300]   In other words, you guys were low class.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:44.740]   And despised, God has chosen the things that are not so that he may nullify the things
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.740]   that are.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:54.520]   So that no man may boast before God, but by his doing, you are in Christ Jesus.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.220]   The whole rebellion of mankind is his pride.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.700]   Satan wanted to get the glory and worship that God had.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.340]   Adam and Eve wanted to be like God.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.540]   As soon as they had the opportunity, they built the Tower of Babel because they wanted
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.780]   to get to God by their own strength.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.740]   And God deliberately destroys them and scatters them.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:19.460]   And so the fundamental rebellion of mankind is he wants to elevate himself near to God
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.220]   or above God.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:31.260]   God says he comes and the gospel message is that he's coming to destroy what the world
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.580]   considers wise.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.380]   What the world considers strong.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.980]   What the world considers noble.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.540]   And he's deliberately chosen the weak things in order to dumbfound the wise.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.580]   So basically what did he do?
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.300]   He flipped the table and that's what he was trying to tell the disciples.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.500]   They were like anybody else.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.980]   They wanted to follow Jesus and if they stay close to him enough, when the kingdom comes,
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.180]   am I going to sit to the left or to the right?
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:05.260]   And that's why he deliberately got on his knees to serve his disciples and to do the
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.020]   most menial task of washing their feet.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.940]   And he said those who are the servants in the kingdom of God, they are the greatest
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:13.940]   in the kingdom.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.100]   He was taking the weakest things and he was flipping the table over this sinful world
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.900]   that's trying so hard to get on the top.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.900]   And that's why our salvation is described by Ephesians 2.8.9, "For by grace you have
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.900]   been saved through faith that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not as a result of
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.100]   us, so that no one may boast."
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.980]   There is no boasting in the kingdom of God.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.940]   You didn't earn it.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.940]   I didn't earn it.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.940]   You didn't earn it.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.060]   There is no boasting in the kingdom of God.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.500]   A Christian who is boasting doesn't know the gospel.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.740]   He doesn't know Christ because he thinks somehow he did it.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.220]   He thinks somehow he worked harder than other people.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.140]   He thinks somehow he achieved greater things.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:00.820]   See the whole point of this Jericho, before he goes in, he reminds Joshua and the rest
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.000]   of Israel, it is not you.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.940]   This wall is going to fall but it has nothing to do with you.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.300]   If anything, you deserve to be crushed.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:19.300]   If this promise that God made was a conditional promise that God made to Abraham, it would
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.900]   have been done a long time ago.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.900]   You guys would have never made it out of Egypt.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.700]   You would have never made it through the Red Sea.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.700]   You would have never crossed the Jordan River if it was you.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.740]   That was the point that he was trying to make.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.140]   He's trying to be faithful to his own covenant.
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:46.980]   Now as fundamental as this is to our faith, it is so hard to shake.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.900]   It's so hard to shake.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.540]   Because ever since we are born, we're taught to mature.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.860]   What does mature mean?
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.220]   To be independent, to take care of yourself.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.780]   I remember when that thought really gripped me.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:09.940]   I think I was a freshman or sophomore in college and I had a job out here in Irvine.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:16.420]   I was going to Biola and somebody I knew was a manager of some restaurant over here.
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.700]   So I had to come here every day, five to one in the afternoon.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.220]   I remember working and I just happened to be really sick that day and there was nobody
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.220]   to replace me.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.540]   So I came into work.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.540]   I was just sweating.
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.780]   I had a fever.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.980]   I was a cashier and I was feeling so bad.
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.860]   I was thinking like, "I need a break."
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.180]   But there's no break because no one could take my place.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:49.420]   The boss who was there, he needed me to do my job or else he can't run the thing.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.700]   So I remember feeling so bad and it got so bad in the middle I went into the closet and
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.580]   I threw up.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.220]   I was coughing, I was sweating.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.140]   As soon as I caught my breath, I had to go back out to work.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.500]   I was there for the rest of the day, probably about three, four hours just sweating and
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.340]   just barely making it.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:13.460]   Through that whole process of misery, I was thinking, "This is life."
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.820]   That's what I was thinking, "This is life.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.980]   No one's going to help you.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.980]   Your mommy's not around.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.500]   You're not a kid anymore.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.860]   Grow up, Peter.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.860]   This is life."
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.200]   Things get hard, suck it up.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.300]   So that's been my theme of life since, suck it up.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.100]   There's certain things that you can't change.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.740]   Sometimes bad things happen.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.020]   Sometimes you're sick and you have to go to work.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.260]   Suck it up.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.380]   So that's kind of like pride myself being suck it up.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.260]   But you just, "Niis keta, niis keta."
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:54.020]   I thought I was the suck it up king and then I met my wife and she's really the suck it
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.340]   up king.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:04.380]   But the reason why this is so hard is because the world values hard work.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.620]   We talk about how many of our immigrant parents work two jobs and three jobs.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.940]   They work so hard to achieve what they...
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.940]   We value that.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:12.940]   We're stuck to that.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.900]   When we raise our kids, money doesn't grow off of trees.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.820]   You bum, get a job.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.820]   Do your work.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.460]   The harder you work, the more you can achieve.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:30.540]   So everything that we do since we're children, we're taught to work hard, to move ahead,
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.140]   to get ahead.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.940]   Even as Christians, work hard to be disciplined, to memorize scripture, to pray longer and
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:38.940]   study the Bible.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:45.140]   All of these things, again, none of these things in and of itself innately is wrong.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:53.020]   But that is so hard to shake because when it comes to our spiritual life, it does so
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.540]   much damage.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.180]   Because the very get go of our salvation is to come before God and recognize how helpless
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.460]   we are and that's what brings us to repentance.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.820]   Repentance isn't, "You know what?
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.100]   I should have gotten an A, but I got a C, but I'm going to try harder to get an A."
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.100]   That's not repentance.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:19.260]   Repentance that leads to salvation is recognizing that I can never bridge this gap.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:24.980]   There is nothing I can do to bridge this gap between me and this holy God.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.140]   And so I surrender.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.780]   I repent not only of what I did, I repent of who I am.
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.140]   And you completely surrender everything to God.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.100]   You're in charge now.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.380]   That's what begins our salvation.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.740]   At some point in our sanctification, we pick back up.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.940]   I'm going to work harder.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.780]   I'm going to be better.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.220]   We make resolutions.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.620]   And then when things don't turn out the way it does, we get frustrated.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.300]   Where's God?
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.780]   Again, don't get me wrong.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.940]   Remember where chapter 11 is.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.620]   By faith, they did all of this.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.820]   But the important part of this is by faith.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.260]   By faith.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.800]   Our strength to do anything is by faith.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.700]   Not simply our determination, not simply because of our knowledge, not because of our experience,
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.140]   but because of our connection to God.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.780]   And that's the point that he's trying to tell us.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.220]   Remember when Jesus shows up?
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.900]   You remember the zealots?
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:33.980]   The zealots were people who were willing to die to preserve Israel.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.180]   So they were always ready to go.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.820]   They had a knife carrying around.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.340]   And if they get an opportunity, they're going to knife somebody and create a revolution.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.620]   So these guys, in their own way, were picking up the cross.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.420]   They were sacrificing because they were willing to die for Israel.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.740]   Jesus didn't come to them and say, "Good job.
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.780]   Good job, zealots."
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.660]   He didn't say the Sadducees were very politically savvy.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:05.100]   They're going to preserve Israel through having a great relationship with the Romans.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.260]   They used their intellect and their influence to be able to preserve Israel.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.180]   So they were politically trying to preserve the nation.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.520]   Jesus didn't show up to the Sadducees and say, "Good job.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.260]   You guys are so savvy, and because of you, Israel is being preserved."
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.980]   He didn't say it's the Sadducees who are trying so hard to keep the law.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:31.260]   The Bible says and Jesus says, they were proselytizing, they were praying, they were tithing.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.100]   As far as discipline is concerned, they were more disciplined than anybody else.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:39.020]   And he didn't say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant, because you tried harder
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.020]   than anybody else."
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.020]   That's not what he said.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:46.300]   He said, "You pray, but you pray for other people to see.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.940]   You study the Bible so that you can show off.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:53.260]   You're proselytizing, and you proselytize and convert them and make them just as much,
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.060]   twice as much the son of the devil than you.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:01.020]   You give, but you give so that other people can recognize how generous you are.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.140]   Everything that you're doing, you're doing for other people to see."
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.260]   He didn't say, "Good job."
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.260]   You know what?
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.260]   He was always amazed.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.340]   Whenever you see the term, "Jesus was amazed," do you know what follows after that?
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.780]   He was amazed by their faith.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:23.060]   Whether they were rich or poor, whether they were strong or weak, what surprised Jesus
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.460]   was always their faith.
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.060]   What disappointment.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.320]   When he was disappointed, he said, "You of little faith."
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.860]   It was their faith.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:39.940]   It was what connected them to the Holy God, because their power didn't come from them.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.560]   Their righteousness didn't come from them.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.780]   Their fruit didn't come from them.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   It's their faith.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:51.220]   Whatever faith that they had is what connected them to this Holy God that caused them to
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.260]   be fruitful.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.940]   That's why he said, "If you want to be fruitful, work hard.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.460]   Want to be fruitful, study hard.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.900]   If you want to be fruitful," he said, "abide."
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   Abide.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.900]   Stay.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.900]   Stay.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.900]   Remain.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.900]   Remain.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:14.460]   So our primary call as Christians is to abide in Christ.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.460]   Abide in Christ.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.500]   To stay in Christ.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.740]   To remain in Christ.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.640]   To trust in Christ.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.540]   To continue in Christ.
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.580]   That is our primary call.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.260]   Anything else is human arrogance.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.780]   It's our effort to work hard to get ahead.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.280]   To move ahead.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.460]   To be better.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.020]   Stronger.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.140]   It is when we are weak, he is strong.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:46.300]   That's why the only instruction that God gives Joshua in Joshua 1, 6-9, he says, "To be
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.980]   strong and courageous.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:53.260]   For you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their forefathers.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.460]   Only be strong and courageous."
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.340]   Verse 8, "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.700]   it day and night so that you may be careful to do all that is written in it.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.340]   For then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have success."
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:10.220]   And it said, the only instruction is be strong and courageous.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.340]   Do exactly as I tell you.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.300]   Don't turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.740]   Whether it makes sense or doesn't make sense.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:22.460]   And remember, the instruction God gave them was, when you get in there, remember that
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.500]   Ark of the Covenant, remember that box that I gave you?
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:31.140]   Get seven priests to walk ahead of the rest of you and the distance was about 2,000 cubit.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.140]   2,000 cubit is about half a mile.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.940]   A little bit more than half a mile.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.460]   So seven priests, I mean, think about it.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.940]   If you're going into battle, that's the worst thing to do.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.740]   Like all they're doing is marching.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.940]   And my guess is, while they're marching, they're Muslim.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.860]   These guys are descendants of grumblers.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.860]   My guess is somebody grumbling is like, "What are we doing?
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.460]   Didn't he say we're going to conquer this land?
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.460]   How is this strange?
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.460]   We're tired."
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.820]   Every day, carry the box, seven priests.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.260]   And this is what they did for six days.
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.740]   All right.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.900]   I mean, this is going to conquer Jericho?
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.700]   My guess is there was some grumbling in there.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.940]   It's not recorded, but my guess is.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.940]   Right?
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.820]   Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, right?
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:26.100]   On the seventh day, this is the day that the Lord is going to give you this.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.100]   What should we do?
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.500]   Well, remember how you carry that box?
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.860]   This time do it seven times.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.300]   Seven times.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   That's what they did.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.180]   Exactly what God said.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.020]   Don't turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.540]   They carried this box, seven priests, right?
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.580]   And it wasn't sharpen your sword, right?
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.140]   Go in there and flank.
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.500]   You go left, you go right, and then I'll be the command when I blow the trumpet, all you
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.500]   guys rise.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.500]   None of that.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.620]   Just carry this box, right?
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:05.300]   Which the covenant was representative of the presence of God in Israel.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:11.680]   And it was to show the nation of Israel that the Lord is going to give you this, not you.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   So you know what happens.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.380]   They marched seven times.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.780]   Can you imagine how tired they were after seven?
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.380]   I know there were wonders in the desert, but seven times around the city carrying this
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:25.020]   box and then they stopped and they're like, Oh my gosh, you're so tired.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.020]   Okay.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.020]   And then, and then blow the trumpet.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:32.180]   They blow the trumpet exactly as God said, and the wall comes tumbling down and all they
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.300]   did was just walk in.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.620]   Right?
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.380]   And exactly as God said, it wasn't you.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.380]   It wasn't you.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:48.460]   In fact, the primary sin of Israel was whenever they forgot that and they became proud.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.660]   And that's when sin started coming into their camp.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:56.620]   So the same lesson that God's been trying to teach them over and over again, it is not
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.060]   you.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.500]   Your strength does not come from you.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.700]   Your might does not come from you.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.100]   Your wisdom doesn't come from you.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.660]   Your power, your fruit, it doesn't come from you.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.660]   Abide in me.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:09.660]   Abide in me.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.660]   Abide in me.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.060]   Abide in me.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.060]   Do not boast.
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.060]   Do not boast.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.060]   Do not boast.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.060]   Do not boast.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:24.060]   So Joshua, when he was ready in Joshua 3, 5, he says, "Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.260]   the Lord will do wonders among you."
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.260]   So Joshua knew.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.260]   Right?
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.260]   So that was the first question.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.780]   Why is Joshua's name not there?
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.140]   Because Joshua was not the central figure.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.420]   Whether his name was mentioned or it wasn't mentioned, it was not, that was not the point.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.500]   The point is what God was doing.
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.620]   But the second question, we're not going to spend a lot of time on this one, then why
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.180]   is Rahab's name mentioned?
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.140]   In fact, it's not just Rahab.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.140]   Right?
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:55.380]   At some point in history, Rahab was a harlot.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:02.800]   But because her name is written in the Bible, she will forever be known as Rahab the harlot.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.020]   Because that's how it was mentioned to us in Joshua, and that's how it's mentioned to
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.340]   us here.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.300]   Why is the fact that she was a harlot described here?
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.420]   David is not described as David the murderer.
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.060]   Right?
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.460]   David is not described to us as David the adulterer, David the murderer.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.460]   Right?
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.700]   God forgave David.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:28.620]   But why is Rahab's name even on this list of, I mean, think about who's on this list.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.620]   Right?
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.620]   Abraham.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.620]   Right?
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.620]   Abraham's on this list.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.140]   Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joseph.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.780]   I mean, think about the people on this list.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.820]   And then we skip Joshua.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.940]   And then Rahab the harlot.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.940]   Right?
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:50.300]   Do you think when we get to heaven, we're going to see Rahab's like, "There's Rahab the harlot."
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.420]   I hope not.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.900]   But why is that emphasized here?
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.940]   Why is her name here when Joshua's name is not?
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:04.280]   And think about what exactly did Rahab do?
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.140]   That was worth being on this list.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:12.380]   Well, the only thing that we know is Joshua 2, 8 through 11, this is what Rahab says.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.060]   The spies come to spy out the land and she basically protects them.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.140]   But the reason why she protects them is what is mentioned in verse 8.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.820]   "Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof and said to the men," this
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.180]   is the men, the Israelites who are hiding, "I know that the Lord has given you the land
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.300]   and that the terror of you has fallen on us and that all the inhabitants of the land have
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.980]   melted away before you."
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.060]   In other words, she was scared.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.540]   Before they even came, there was a reputation of the Israelites.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.500]   And this is what she says.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.020]   Verse 10, "For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea."
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.660]   Remember when that happened 40 years ago?
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.900]   Dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.980]   I said, "Wow, the Egyptians couldn't find them.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.660]   God delivered them from Egypt.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.060]   They heard about that.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.780]   And what you did to the two kings of Amorites and beyond the Jordan to Sihon and Og, whom
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.940]   you utterly destroyed.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.580]   When we heard of it, our hearts melted and no courage remained in any man any longer
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.860]   because of you.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:23.420]   For the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above and on the earth below."
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:28.140]   Think about this great faith that made it into the hall of fame, right?
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.220]   What was it that she did?
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.580]   Look at the way it's described.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.580]   By faith, Rahab the harlot did not perish.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.820]   Did not perish along with the other disobedient.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.860]   That was the claim to fame.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.060]   She didn't die.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.740]   That's why she's on this list of people, right?
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.780]   The cloud of witnesses that went there.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:56.500]   Rahab the harlot, by faith, did not perish along with the others who were disobedient.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   She was trying to save herself because she heard that here's this nation coming.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:09.660]   Clearly they're not powerful, but there's something supernatural going on.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.300]   And she believed it was their God.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:18.660]   I mean, what kind of God do you serve that even the Egyptians can't bind you?
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.860]   And so the terror fell upon everybody else.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:25.220]   But the difference with her is she decided to side with Israel.
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.780]   She lies.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.460]   They're not here, right?
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:34.300]   There's nothing necessarily noble about what she did other than she was trying to save
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.660]   her neck and she was trying to save her family.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.180]   That's it.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:44.340]   But the reason why she made it on this list is because by faith.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.060]   It's because she believed.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:55.020]   She believed in the God of Israel more than whatever it is that she was holding on to.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:59.140]   So the point of this isn't about Rahab, it's not about Joshua, it's not about Moses, it's
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.660]   not about Abraham.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.660]   It's about by faith.
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:06.860]   That's why each of these passages start with by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:16.820]   That even Rahab the harlot was preserved and even in her imperfect life, known as a harlot,
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:24.380]   because of faith, she made it into the Hall of Fame.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:29.980]   There's going to be a lot of people in heaven, I believe, that we're going to be surprised
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.180]   to see.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.780]   You got there?
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.060]   How did you get up here?
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.660]   I know your life.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.780]   I know what you did.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.780]   You're constantly struggling.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:46.220]   Yeah, but I believed.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:53.140]   There's going to be some people up there that I think many of us are going to be surprised.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:58.140]   And then there's going to be some people up there thinking like, how come he's not here?
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.260]   How come she's not here?
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:06.700]   Because you and I have a tendency to measure everything by what we see.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.700]   What did they achieve?
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.700]   What did they not achieve?
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.700]   What did they do?
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.700]   How much did they sacrifice?
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.140]   We measure everything by what we see.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:16.620]   God measures our righteousness by our faith.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:21.100]   God measures our production by our faith.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:28.780]   And so by faith, even somebody like Harlot made it onto this list of Hall of Fame.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.460]   In fact, eventually she ends up marrying an Israelite.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.780]   She becomes a great, great, great, great grandfather of King David.
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:44.100]   And then King David is a great, great, great, great, great grandfather of Jesus.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.060]   And so she made it onto this list.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:54.260]   I don't know about you, but our God is amazing.
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:00.940]   I mean, it humbles us and lifts us up at the same time.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:06.540]   It destroys our pride and fills us with hope all at the same time.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.220]   Like, you're nothing.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:13.100]   They'll kill you.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:19.180]   And then you're filled with confidence and courage at the same time.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:27.140]   He destroys our pride because only when our pride is destroyed will He be lifted up.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.140]   And let me finish with this.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:33.620]   Remember the story of Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman, right?
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:38.500]   And those two stories are really meant to be read together because, you know, John is
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.540]   introducing the gospel and Nicodemus comes out because he's considered the most righteous
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.420]   man because he's on the Sanhedrin and he's a Pharisee among Pharisees, so he kept the
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.780]   law perfect.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.420]   So he comes and remember, he's afraid of his reputation.
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.780]   He comes at night so that his friends wouldn't see.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.620]   And he's conversing with Jesus like, "How do I get to heaven?"
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.500]   Jesus says, "You must be born again."
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.220]   Born again?
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.220]   How does a man be born again?
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.020]   He's like, "Well, you can't.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.620]   That's the work of the Holy Spirit."
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.580]   So he tells this man who had a reputation of being holy, who's already made it to the
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:16.340]   top of the heap, all of that's not going to help you at all, right?
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.580]   You have to be born again.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.820]   The very next chapter, he meets a Samaritan woman.
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.980]   We don't even know her name.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.980]   She's not even mentioned by name.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.300]   She's just Samaritan woman.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.420]   By the Jews who's considered half-breeds, right?
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.360]   They were compromisers.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.440]   They weren't considered righteous.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.220]   And Jesus actually pursues after her.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:41.620]   He's come to the middle of the day and she was probably considered a harlot among the
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.620]   Samaritans.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.380]   And he talks to her and he draws her out and says, "The water that I give you will give
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.180]   you eternal life and you won't be thirsty again."
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:56.140]   And then she meets Christ and she becomes the first evangelist to the Samaritans.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:00.220]   The Samaritans come to Christ as a result of her.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:04.580]   But if you read that two-story together, here's this man who's filled with pride, who's top
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:09.940]   of righteousness according to Israel, he humbles him and says, "You must be born again."
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:16.100]   And then he chases after this woman who was living in sin and then raises her up to tell
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:21.620]   them that the gospel brings the mountains low and the valleys high and the entrance
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.660]   into the kingdom is the same door.
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.800]   It's the same door.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.620]   Whether you are high, whether you are significant, whether you are educated, whether you are
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:38.100]   talented, no matter how old you are, no matter how awful you think you are, no matter what
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:43.820]   your past is, no matter how much you've fallen, it is the same grace of God that brings us
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.020]   through the same door.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:56.700]   So the point of chapter 11 is by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:05.380]   It is not, it is not because of my faithfulness that our church has gotten here.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:12.500]   It is not because of the faithfulness of a few of the leaders that our church got here.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:22.020]   And I'm not saying that as a humble brag because I know myself better than you know me.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:27.340]   And God knows me much better than even I know myself.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:35.700]   Whatever fruit that we are allowed to experience, God is pursuing his own glory.
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:42.980]   If there's anything that I have to work toward is to make sure that we don't touch that glory.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:47.900]   It is man's arrogance to think that somehow if we have the right smart people, disciplined
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:55.580]   people, trained people, good people, that we'll see good things.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.340]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:05.900]   When we recognize that, we can be more patient with people who are struggling.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:11.540]   We can be more patient with people who are not up to par.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:16.060]   We can help them, we can assist them, but we can be more patient because we see ourselves
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.460]   in the same boat.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.300]   Because we're all saved by grace.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.460]   We're all working to get to God.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:31.100]   So whether you are Rahab, whether you are Joshua, by faith and by faith alone, we're
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.540]   going to make it to heaven.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:41.700]   I pray that this truth that Hebrews 11 keeps pounding over and over and over and over again
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:48.740]   would really transform our paradigm of how we look at our spiritual life and how we work
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.900]   toward honoring God.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:50:00.940]   Because what God has called us to show the world should look different than the world.
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:07.060]   In the world, you work hard, you make a lot of money, you become something successful,
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:13.580]   you become influential, then you become honored, then people follow you, then you are adored.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.980]   That's the world.
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.540]   But the kingdom of God is completely different.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:27.700]   The kingdom of God challenges the principles of this world where he dumbfounds the world.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:36.140]   Where people who are nothing, people who recognize that we have nothing, and yet this community
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:40.060]   glorifies and magnifies Christ.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:44.540]   By faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.620]   Let's take a few minutes to pray again as we ask the praise team to come back up.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:53.540]   To take some time to reflect and think.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:51:01.660]   All of us, to some degree or another, some of you are A students spiritually, or maybe
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.380]   you think you are.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:08.700]   Some of you are F students, right?
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:16.900]   You're like, "Oh my gosh, I keep struggling with the same thing over and over again."
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:21.460]   And many of us fall somewhere in between.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:25.460]   Because all of our eyes are focused on ourselves.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:30.220]   And that's the whole point, is to take our eyes off of ourselves and see God.
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.820]   Because if your hope is on yourself, look at God.
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.740]   You will lose all confidence.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.580]   You will lose all hope.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:44.820]   And yet when we look at the cross, God restores all of it back.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:49.580]   So let's take a step back and think.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:54.580]   And to thank God that it is by faith and by faith alone.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.460]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leaves us.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:06.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
