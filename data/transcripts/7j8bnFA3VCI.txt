[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.920]   You'll see the blue canopy.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.920]   We have some of our members there.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   We'd love to meet you and also provide you some more information about the church.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.920]   I would like to highlight some important announcements for us today.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   The first is that for all the men, we have a men's ministry fellowship that will take place on November 9th.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   And that's going to take place from 9 a.m. through lunch.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   It's just $10 to participate.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   It's a great time to come together, fellowship, praise, and learn.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   So please make sure you mark that on your calendar and sign up.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   Today is a particularly busy day.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.920]   We have our members meeting at 2 p.m.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   So please make sure for all the members that you show up here in the sanctuary by 2.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   And right before that, we're going to be having our youth group fundraiser.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   So we're preparing for a retreat come early in the year, in 2025.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   So the students put together a really delicious Mediterranean bowl.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.920]   We will be serving lunch after this service and also the third service.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   For those of you guys who are serving, please make sure to make your way to support and also to have lunch.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   There is a child safety training day on Sunday, October 20th, which takes place from 1.30 p.m.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.920]   If you'd like to -- first, there is a membership requirement.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   But if you'd like to volunteer with students at any extended period of time, we do require that you be safety trained.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   So there's an opportunity here on October 20th.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   Please make sure you sign up for that.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   There is a reformation night taking place October 31st, Thursday night.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.920]   So the registration for all the student participants are open.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   So please make sure to put that in your to-do to sign them up.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   And it's going to be a great time.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   You'll have a teaching about the reformation, a carnival games, and more.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   The last thing I want to mention is the regional Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   So as you know, we've been announcing it a little bit here and there that we're going to come together in various people's homes.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   Thank you to those who signed up as hosts.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   And then we need to put people in these groups.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   So please make sure you sign up early because that's going to be quite a task getting all these people into various homes.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   It's going to be Sunday on November 24th at 5 p.m.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.920]   So please make sure you sign up to participate.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920]   Okay.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:26.920]   Today, after our worship set, we're going to be having the privilege of hearing Kaylee Jung come up and give her testimony and be baptized.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.920]   At this time, we're going to be having a time of offering.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   So those of you who have checks, please know at the end of service you can visit the drop box right next to the entrance.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.920]   Otherwise, we'll give our offering digitally.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.920]   Let's pray.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to you.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   You are the God who gives mercy every single day, and you sustain us.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   And, God, you lavish on us so much love through your son, Jesus Christ, and through your providence.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:00.920]   And so we thank you, and we ask, God, that we would respond to you with so much gratitude in our hearts,
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.920]   seeing the privilege just to know you, to be known by you, to sing to you, and to be able to enter your house.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   And I ask, God, that even in our offering and our giving, help us to see it just like that,
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   that we are just simply responding in worship to all that you have granted to us.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:23.920]   We do pray, God, for our church, that constantly our faith would be growing, our love for you would be growing,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   and in everything, Lord, we would be expressing our worshipful heart to you.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   Amen.

[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:51.240]   Hi, my name is Kaylee John, and this is my testimony.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.880]   I was born into a Christian family
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.800]   and professed to be a Christian.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.160]   As time passed, attending church steadily
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.840]   became more of a burden, and I purely went out of obligation.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.360]   I became more separated from my Christian identity
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.000]   as my desire to conform with the world grew.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.960]   And with the secular influence of the world,
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.840]   I began to question God's existence as a whole.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.600]   I learned about sin and the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.160]   many times in church, but these teachings
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.040]   just became routine to me.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.400]   As I grew up, I began to experience
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   the repercussions of my sin.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.200]   I idolized myself and my identity in many ways,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.480]   and I came to hate who I was.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.400]   In my ignorance, I did not recognize
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.600]   my suffering came from the result of sin,
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.080]   and I began to question if life even had a purpose.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.880]   If I had a relationship with God,
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.320]   I was seeking the transactional benefits of following Christ.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.160]   But because life wasn't going my way,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.080]   I selfishly thought a good God couldn't exist,
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.120]   and I began to resent the idea of him.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.040]   By God's magnificent timing, I was
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.080]   sobered with the depth that comes with grief,
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.320]   and I was drawn back to reality from my state
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   of dark and sinful thinking.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.280]   One tragedy in particular caught me in a vulnerable time
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.400]   and made me reconsider my life.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.360]   I found it a coincidence that among all the unbelievers
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.200]   in my family, these deaths were of the strong believers.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.640]   It was here that I was challenged
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.440]   to think about God's authority over life and death.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.820]   I questioned the existence of a living God,
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.280]   as this couldn't have just been a pure coincidence.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.880]   Through this season, I would constantly
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.920]   think about death and the possibilities
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.680]   of the so-called heaven, and through my confusion,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.320]   I found more of a purpose to seek attendance in church.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.440]   Although I continued to seek out church with a hardened heart,
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.480]   there was this one Sunday where a certain topic was discussed
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.480]   that changed my perspective.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.760]   Through this sermon, I began to grow
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.800]   curious at the possibility that there
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.120]   could be a God who loves me and knows every part of me.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.720]   And through my questioning why I was created,
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.000]   I thought maybe the creation of my life was wanted all along.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.800]   It was still clear that I was seeking God
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.280]   with a self-centered mind, but the possible truth
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.880]   of God's omnipotence sparked a spiritual hunger
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.320]   cue in my brain.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.560]   By God's faithfulness, I was brought to a church
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.200]   rooted in the scripture.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.880]   Going through scripture word for word,
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.440]   I was amazed and realized that context changes everything.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.000]   And in a way, the Bible no longer
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.840]   became a fable but a tangible source of God's inerrant word.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.120]   With these teachings, my curiosity and knowledge
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.640]   began to grow, and I came to know
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.720]   bits and pieces of the gospel.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.400]   However, much of this knowledge remained in my head,
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.080]   and there was still no conviction within my heart.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.000]   I would learn about sins and would immediately
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.840]   think of ways to rid of these sins through my flesh,
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.280]   but it was in this way of thinking
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   that blinded me from the truth.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.040]   I finally sought personal prayer,
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.160]   surrendering the works of my flesh
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.640]   and patiently trusting in God's will
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   that he would reveal the parts of the gospel that had not yet
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.160]   penetrated my heart.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.720]   Through God's timing, he continued
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.600]   to show me more of his good character
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.080]   and the innate state of my sin.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.800]   In John 14.6, Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the truth
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   and the life.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.400]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.160]   I had heard this verse my whole life,
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.880]   but it was not until the point in which I was saved
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.760]   that I understood what it meant.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.840]   I recognized the weakness of my flesh
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.640]   and that no amount of perseverance in my works
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.020]   would be surmountable to make me righteous in front of God.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.560]   It was in this helplessness that I
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.960]   recognized my need for a savior.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.880]   That savior was Jesus Christ, and it
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.720]   was through Christ and Christ alone
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.240]   that I could be forgiven in front of a holy God.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.120]   Second Corinthians 5.21 says, "He
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.720]   made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.240]   so that we might become the righteousness of God in him."
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.840]   It was the good news from God whom I once hated and rejected.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.600]   God could have justly practiced his judgment and wrath upon me,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.720]   but he showed me more of his goodness
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.800]   even in my sorrow and shame.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.040]   In God's supernatural love, a love
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.640]   that only a holy God could have, saw
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.520]   the entirety of my wickedness and yet still
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.240]   chose to save me by the crucifixion and resurrection
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.520]   of Christ.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.280]   By God's grace, I finally came to see the glory that
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.560]   was carried on that cross.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.040]   Since professing my faith, I learned
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.400]   what it means to love others as myself,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.560]   to rejoice in all things, the importance of evangelism,
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.180]   and to live for the purpose of expanding his kingdom.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.180]   Living my life in full worship of the Lord
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.620]   is the least I could do for what I received,
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.960]   so may I continue to pursue to live a life in a manner worthy
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.480]   of the gospel.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.520]   Even now, where so many of my sins are unrealized,
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.740]   God allows me to live in his amazing grace.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.680]   All praise and honor and glory be to God
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.640]   that even in our fallen state, he
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.920]   continues to redeem those who believe and live
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.720]   in accordance with him.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   Colossians 3, 1 to 4 says, "Therefore,
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.380]   if you have been raised up with Christ,
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.120]   keep seeking the things above where Christ is.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.560]   Seated at the right hand of God, set your mind
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.160]   on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.600]   For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.680]   When Christ, who is our life, is revealed,
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.480]   then you will also be revealed with him in glory."
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   Thank you.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.960]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:24.200]   Thank you for that testimony.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.460]   As you go into the water, you understand
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.480]   that this represents the union with Christ in his death
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.440]   and to come out, union with Christ, resurrection time.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.920]   I pass you now in the name of the Father,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.920]   in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:49.360]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:29:08.560]   OK, thank you again, Kaylee, for that testimony.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.280]   It was such a privilege to fellowship in that way,
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:17.040]   thinking of this exact same story and experience for us
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   where we're given light by the Lord to recognize
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.120]   our sin and to receive messages of salvation.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.960]   This morning, I have a unique privilege
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.720]   to think about evangelism, missions, and the gospel
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.000]   as already the days have gone fast.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.280]   And next Saturday, our team, missions team to Taiwan
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.640]   is going to be leaving from the John Wayne Airport here.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.600]   And we'll be leaving Saturday evening at 6.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.840]   But at a previous members meeting,
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.360]   I introduced the team to you, Pastor Peter, Kim, and I.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.280]   We'll be leading the team, meeting Pastor Alex there
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.560]   in Taiwan.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.560]   And we're going to be fellowshipping
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.360]   with this church out there called Hope Church,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.680]   primarily working with college students.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.320]   Pastor Alex has set up our schedule
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.360]   where during the daytime, we're going
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.840]   to be going to college campuses, presenting English lessons,
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.040]   doing English discussions, and connecting with the students.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.080]   And in the evening, we'll be hosting English Corners
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   where casually students can come.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.400]   We'll build relationships.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.120]   And by the end of the week, we'll
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.760]   be ministering at the church, but also
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.720]   going on tours and hikes with the students
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.640]   that we've built relationship with.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.120]   So please make sure to pray for us
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.200]   that it's a pretty brief opportunity,
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.040]   but that we would make the connection
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.000]   and we would have opportunities to share.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.680]   Just so that you guys can pray individually,
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.160]   previously I had very small little icons.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.360]   I have full slides for each one.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.640]   And we're just going to go through them really quickly.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.080]   The first individual is Daniel.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.560]   Daniel Hsu, the next individual is Joanne Chin.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.200]   We also have Justin Wu.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.560]   It's a nice photo.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.720]   We have Kim Ting.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.760]   We also have Jay Lee.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:09.320]   We have Tim Tang, Tiffany Chen, David Lee, Sam Wang, Daphne Su,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.720]   Vanessa Yu.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.800]   All right.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.560]   So please, again, we do request that for the week
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.960]   that we're gone, there's a lot of travel time, et cetera.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.560]   And we just really want to ask you to pray for us
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.240]   that the missions trip, we would be bold,
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.120]   we would God provide opportunities,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.200]   and that he would provide providentially those times
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.560]   where we can really share.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.120]   Let's take a moment to pray together.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:37.600]   Heavenly Father, God, we know you
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.280]   have ordained the preaching of your word to go forth.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.000]   And we ask God that regardless of age,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.480]   regardless of circumstance of life,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.800]   that that would be at the top priority of the opportunities
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.320]   that we're looking for.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.800]   But we ask God that you would bless it.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.880]   Oh Lord, we pray for your spirit to minister to us
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.600]   that we would be convinced, convicted, bold, courageous.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   God, we would be faithful, accurate to your word,
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.160]   and that we would represent you in the name of Christ well.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.800]   We ask God that it would be a blessed time where
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.120]   we could honor you.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.600]   And also, Lord, we would share in the joy
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.600]   that if one person, if a lot of people, whatever fruit
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.960]   you will bear, God, that we would rejoice with the heavens
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.480]   and with the saints when one lost individual is found.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.920]   We thank you, God, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.920]   As a way to get us to think, I have a pop quiz question
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.480]   for you, not necessarily a pop quiz, but maybe just asking
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.280]   you to remember what was the sermon topic last week?
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.600]   Any volunteers?
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.940]   I'm just kidding, I'm not gonna make you raise your hand
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.040]   in this large group.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.800]   Last week, Pastor Peter really, really sets the stage
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.640]   for the sermon today.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.240]   And because he established and set the problem, okay?
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.000]   And the problem was, in his preaching through the gospel
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.200]   in Luke, he said God was very, very clear and explicit
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   that we Christians are going to suffer for his name.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.520]   By identifying with Jesus Christ, we're going to be hated.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.100]   When we try to live righteously, people will,
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.800]   the darkness will try to overtake us, deceive us,
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.360]   if at all possible.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.080]   And so what we have is a massive wall of resistance,
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.560]   rejection, persecution, and hardship anytime we try
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.600]   to be a faithful Christian.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.960]   But the problem is, we live with a lot of fear.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.480]   Every single one of us, we have different personalities
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.220]   and gradients of what we're accustomed to,
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.120]   but we struggle with fear.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.500]   And so in the face of a great expectation
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.640]   that we would be so bold to name the name of Jesus,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.600]   we actually have a lot of anxiety
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   that things will get awkward.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.180]   We have a lot of fear that we'll get rejected.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.440]   Sometimes we're very apprehensive because we think
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.260]   that we won't know what to say.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.440]   And sometimes people kind of give up
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.640]   because I've heard people say,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.480]   ooh, that kind of thing doesn't work.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.400]   Cold turkey evangelism where you go out, say,
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.560]   hi, my name is, have you heard the name of Jesus?
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.160]   Like, when does that ever work, right?
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.140]   And so people have discounted just straight evangelism
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.480]   in that way, but here we are thinking about going
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.880]   across the seas to do just that,
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.440]   straight cold turkey evangelism.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.680]   Hi, my name is Mark.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.460]   Have you ever thought about eternity?
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.620]   Have you ever heard the name of Jesus?
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.720]   So we're wrought with fear.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.560]   What do we do?
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.440]   Now, Pastor Peter, really, again,
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.640]   it was such a convicting message.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.600]   I took copious notes, but sometimes I forget,
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.000]   so I'm gonna do a review with you.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.540]   He made that problem or presented the problem even worse
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.640]   because of what the scripture says.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.040]   The scripture said, as a review, in Luke 9,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.360]   that he was saying to all of them, the disciples,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.500]   if anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself,
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.520]   take up his cross daily, and follow me.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.280]   All of a sudden, we have a criteria requirement
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.640]   for just to be a disciple.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.000]   You have to deny yourself.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.080]   Verse 24, whoever wishes to save his life will lose it.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.720]   Whoever loses his life for my sake,
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.280]   he is the one who will save it.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.560]   So any element of self-preservation is going to cause us
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.920]   to not experience the joys in the Lord.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.080]   Verse 25, for what is a man profited
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.840]   if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.220]   For whoever is ashamed of me and my words,
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.000]   the Son of Man will be ashamed of him
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.720]   and of the holy angels.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.760]   In other words, yes, you have my sympathy
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.560]   because I feel fear when you walk up to somebody.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.720]   I feel more fear when I walk up to somebody I know,
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.880]   when I try to evangelize to friends and family, et cetera.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.000]   But if I am so ashamed of the name of Christ
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.160]   that I don't speak, the admonition here is
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.720]   then Christ will not represent you.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   That's what he said.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.480]   He posed a problem, that is a massive problem,
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.680]   that when Christ comes in his glory
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.860]   and he comes not as a merciful servant of all,
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.160]   but rather he comes righteously, the judge of all,
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.440]   with authority on the righteous scepter,
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.080]   for him not to represent you is a massive problem,
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.700]   the greatest problem.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.360]   What are we supposed to do?
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.000]   And so he posed a question to us last week,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.960]   how will you gain the boldness that you need?
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.360]   Where does boldness for the disciples come from?
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.520]   And as a review for you, he said,
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.860]   number one, it comes from full conviction of faith,
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.340]   that by faith, if you see the difference
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.100]   between the path that leads to life
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.780]   and the path to destruction, you will move.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.980]   And if you see with your eyes that another person
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.080]   is on that road, ready to be hit by a dump truck,
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.620]   you're going to move because you're moved
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.420]   by what you see in conviction, amen?
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.580]   And then he mentioned that boldness comes
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.340]   from the assurance that Christ's very presence is with us.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.240]   It was him who said that all the authority
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.380]   was given to him, and lo, I am with you
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.040]   to the end of the age.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.720]   How empowering is that?
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.400]   And then he spoke about the love of God,
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.900]   the love of Christ that absolutely compels us.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.440]   That sermon was so good, I'm just giving it to you again.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:43.600]   But without implying that it was in any way incomplete,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.360]   I would like to add letter D, point four, as my sermon.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.520]   That for the boldness we need, we also need
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.900]   to develop a true heart of a servant to the Lord Almighty.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.420]   We have to have the mind, the heart, the desire,
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.620]   and the perspective of a servant.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.520]   In this whole endeavor to see the situation
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.680]   and scenario accurately, you also have to have
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.520]   the posture and the view of yourself.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.720]   In God, he has his vision, he has his desire,
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.640]   he has his will, he has his truth.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.020]   But he also has a big plan of salvation.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.800]   In that plan of salvation, do you have a servant's heart?
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.640]   And so I move to the first point, point one.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.000]   A true servant sees the big picture.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.120]   A true servant sees the big picture.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.740]   You need the servant's heart for boldness
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.040]   because this boldness comes from a servant's perspective
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.240]   on the master's big plan.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:52.880]   God has various things he is working on,
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.240]   but you know that God is so powerful,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.820]   such a master of the universe, he has written
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.760]   the beginning, the middle, and the end.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.520]   He has a metanarrative to his redemptive plan.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.680]   And it is not an unfolding plan by which we,
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.440]   somehow, not as servants, but rather as his consultants,
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.980]   get to change his plan.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.840]   Let me make this point by another way.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.080]   Let me pose you a question, okay?
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.760]   What would you say to me if I came to you and said,
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.060]   "Well, I've got a big plan.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.480]   "I've got such a plan, it's huge."
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.200]   You ready to hear?
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.680]   We're gonna reach a billion people for Jesus.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.880]   We're gonna convert a billion people.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.120]   You and me, brother, let's go.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.080]   You and me, sister, let's go.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.360]   I'm gonna create a conference, a team,
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.480]   a association of churches.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.240]   It's gonna be called the Billion Converts Conference.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.440]   See what I did there, BCC?
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.280]   All right.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.820]   And you're sitting there like,
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.500]   you kind of wouldn't know what to say.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.400]   I like your enthusiasm.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.880]   Take a moment to think, what would God think about that?
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.920]   Little Mark saying, "We're gonna reach a billion people."
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.140]   Do you think he'd pat me on the back and say,
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.740]   "I get your heart, that's good."
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.400]   Take a moment to think.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.660]   I pondered, what would God say?
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:23.660]   I would imagine our Lord and Master being very annoyed.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:28.240]   I would imagine him being incredibly annoyed.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.320]   I think he'd be annoyed because he's sitting,
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.120]   God would sit there and say,
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.560]   "You know, my plan of salvation and how the history,
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.060]   "not just in the past, but the forward-looking history
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.240]   "of events are going to go, I was not silent.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.100]   "Were you listening?
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:48.440]   "I have said repeatedly, wide is the gate,
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.040]   "broad is the way to destruction,
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.040]   "narrow is the gate, few, were you listening?
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.060]   "Throughout all of history, I've been saying,
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.980]   "I will preserve a remnant, were you listening
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.320]   "when I said remnant, remnant, remnant, remnant,
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.120]   "were you listening?
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.640]   "When I told you that the darkness is so vast,
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.280]   "the sinfulness of man is so stubborn,
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.520]   "but to that stubborn and dark place,
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.860]   "I'm gonna shine my light, but the people were rejected
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.560]   "as a testimony against them, did you listen to me?"
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.840]   I want you to think about it another way.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.080]   Imagine you are the CEO of Chick-fil-A, okay?
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.600]   And you already have enough money,
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.320]   you don't need any more money.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.800]   You have plenty of money, okay?
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.620]   But your whole thing was, I wanna bring value
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:39.660]   by adding to the fast food industry, a personal touch.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.760]   It's gotta have great service,
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.380]   it's gotta have a sense of community.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.600]   We will never serve frozen chicken, why?
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.860]   Because I wanted to add more value.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.280]   But here comes consultant Mark.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.080]   "You know what, we're gonna sell a billion
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.700]   "chicken sandwiches, you know?
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.880]   "Trust me, we're gonna like fast freeze this thing,
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.280]   "we're gonna put it in Costco,
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.920]   "once you get into Costco, you're gonna make bank.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.280]   "Trust me, we're gonna reach a billion people
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.200]   "with chicken sandwiches."
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   You're gonna look at me so annoyed.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.060]   "Hello, I don't need your consultation,
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.680]   "you don't have the same vision,
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.320]   "you're not gonna make a billion dollars, go away."
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.300]   Right, why?
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.600]   That is not a servant's heart.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.840]   You have your own vision, you have your own agenda,
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.160]   you have your own picture.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.000]   You don't have God's picture, right?
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.420]   Take a look at Matthew chapter 24, verse eight through 14.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.600]   In Matthew 24, verse eight through 14,
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   it is a picture that Christ himself said multiple times.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.480]   Not just once here, multiple times.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.980]   In Matthew 24, the scripture says,
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.760]   "But all these things are merely
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.000]   "the beginnings of birth pains,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.200]   "when they will deliver you to tribulation
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.120]   "and will kill you.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.360]   "And you will be hated by all nations because of my name."
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.680]   Take a moment to think.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.800]   The vision of God for the moving of the gospel
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.200]   includes the suffering of his children.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.180]   Do you think God has not thought through that?
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.780]   What right does any child or any consultant
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.520]   have to look at this and be like,
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.920]   "Nah, we don't need to do it like that.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.660]   "Trust me, we don't need to do it like that."
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.640]   We can make that gate a lot bigger.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.200]   That is where Christendom actually starts to fail
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.280]   and go astray because they don't get the big picture.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.940]   Verse 10, "At that time, many will fall away
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.680]   "and will betray one another and hate one another.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.960]   "Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.100]   "because lawlessness is increased.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.480]   "Most people's love will grow cold."
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.860]   Doesn't this already describe the coming end of age,
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.360]   the stuff we experience and the stuff that we see?
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.640]   I can understand someone saying,
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.440]   "Man, this is tragic.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.600]   "Man, this is heartbreaking.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.960]   "The people are going to go from bad to worse
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.800]   "and then even worse and more wicked."
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.120]   Such is the coming age.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.080]   And then it says,
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.060]   "But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.480]   "This gospel of the kingdom
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.680]   "shall be preached in the whole world
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.540]   "as a testimony to all the nations
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.240]   "and then the end will come."
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.800]   God has given us this strange,
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.600]   perhaps to some people unacceptable,
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:49.200]   but actually glorious picture.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.520]   I believe because the scriptures has said so,
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.980]   that every single person will bow their knee
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.200]   to the Lord Jesus Christ, amen?
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.920]   But why?
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.040]   Do you know why?
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.680]   Because they are deathly afraid.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.040]   Sadly to say, people will not bend the knee
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.500]   and bow themselves to Jesus
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.160]   because they have fully accepted him as king over his heart
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.640]   because when Christ comes next,
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.680]   he is so powerful, so authoritative,
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.560]   even the rebellious ones will not be able
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.680]   to help themselves.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.280]   They'll either go face flat
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.300]   or they'll die in his presence.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:29.360]   How dare we, to God Almighty and to Christ,
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.100]   say, "Is that loving?
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.640]   "Do we have to do it like that?
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.600]   "If we package this thing a little differently,
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.280]   "can we just get more in?"
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.920]   That is how you ruin the church.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.560]   That is how you ruin the gospel.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:47.040]   The most glorious thing is not to always have
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.760]   people and converts just come in,
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.120]   so here I now ask you this question,
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.860]   even thinking about missions.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.880]   If you have a proper perspective of the big picture,
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.580]   you will be able to answer the question on the specific.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.360]   Is a missions trip or your evangelistic outing
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.540]   only successful when people repent and are converted?
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.640]   I think you know the answer.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.640]   The answer is no, no.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.460]   Why?
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.720]   Because God will be glorified
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.160]   when he gives the testimony of his grace,
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.640]   extending his gracious arm to an obstinate people.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.960]   God has already painted the big picture.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.920]   Many, even in the face of the sacrifice of Jesus,
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.800]   even in the beauty of his glory, will reject him.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:38.580]   But God be glorified, amen?
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.080]   His word has gone forth, amen?
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.240]   And we have represented him accurately
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.440]   as a God of holiness, the God of mercy.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.160]   In this way, even when we think about our missions trip,
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:55.600]   yes, I am not saying that we have no interest
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.960]   in the salvation of people.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.640]   You know that, right?
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.520]   But Apostle Paul says I have become all things
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.880]   to all people because in the hope to save some.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.920]   Apostle Paul is not doing the John Baptist thing,
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.640]   going into the desert and just preaching
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.560]   and people coming to him.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.280]   He's going to the centers, he's going to the marketplace,
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.600]   and namely the synagogues, right?
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.000]   Why, because he wants to preach, he wants to save.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.560]   But the heart of the servant doesn't all of a sudden
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.760]   have his own agenda.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   He says no, Lord, even when people reject me,
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.320]   and yes, your plan has my suffering,
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.560]   your plan has so much risk for me,
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.480]   I'll serve, I'll preach.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.000]   This is the way the heart of the servant is.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.500]   Turn over to Acts chapter 20, verse 22.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.920]   Acts chapter 20, verse 22.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.800]   It says and now behold, bound by the Spirit,
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.520]   I am on my way to Jerusalem,
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.760]   not knowing what will happen to me there,
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.600]   except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.280]   to me in every city, saying that bonds
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.640]   and affliction await me.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.680]   But I do not consider my life of any account
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.120]   as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.280]   in the ministry which I receive from the Lord Jesus
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.720]   to testify solely of the gospel of the grace of God.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.620]   This is the heart of the servant.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:24.560]   You see, you and I, we naturally are bent
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.960]   on judging by flesh, judging by sight,
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.800]   and so when things don't work, when we get hurt,
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   when there's danger and threat, we automatically think
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.460]   something's wrong with the plan.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.740]   But the servant who sees the big picture says,
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.160]   this is what God has ordained.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.600]   The only thing I'm sure of is not Apostle Paul saying,
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.000]   it's gonna be like what Apostle Peter did.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.360]   It's like 3,000 people converting
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.000]   and coming to the Lord in one day.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.360]   All he knew was when I go in there, I'm gonna get beat.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.520]   The only thing he was sure of was affliction.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.680]   The question to us is, do we see that big picture
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.480]   and are we able to say I will serve
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.180]   when there's that kind of risk to my life?
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.900]   That's the heart of the servant, amen?
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.640]   So I move now to point two, that the heart of the servant
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.300]   has this understanding of the master's scheme,
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.560]   meaning his plan, meaning the way things are gonna unfold,
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   even when it goes completely contrary to his natural mind,
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.680]   because the way of God is so much greater,
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.960]   and even the foolishness of God is so much wiser.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.920]   Point two, though, is that a true servant seeks to please.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.240]   A true servant has at the tip of his tongue,
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.880]   what can I do for you?
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.780]   A true servant has the tip of his heart.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.120]   I want to make you happy.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.300]   I want to please you, Lord.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.240]   Now, I wanna ask you this interesting question,
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.300]   because that's not something that is novel and new.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.620]   You've probably heard it so many times
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.360]   in your Christian life.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.880]   But within the Christian jargon
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.640]   and within some of the cliches,
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.920]   I do think there has been some confusion,
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.280]   specifically when it comes to you going out
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.440]   and let's say doing the, what we call,
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.760]   cold turkey evangelism.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.920]   You just take a pamphlet with you, go to the mall,
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   hello, I'm Mark, can I talk to you for a minute?
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.760]   It's like, no, oh man, and then, you know?
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.720]   And then, naturally, I think a lot of people,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.240]   sometimes I've heard people say this,
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.720]   because they get rejected so quickly,
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.400]   they're like, I don't think I was called for this.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:41.020]   Missions, have you thought about missions?
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.880]   And perhaps some of you are already,
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.760]   like, immediately discounting yourself
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.480]   from the service to God in the mission field,
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   because you have thought, that's for people who are called.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.260]   I've never heard the calling.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:51:00.880]   So question, are you waiting for a call from God
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.360]   to take steps to serve him?
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.760]   Are you waiting for a memo, a post-it note,
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.060]   maybe a divine, like, do it?
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.160]   What are you waiting for?
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.160]   And the reason why I ask this,
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.360]   because there are two separate individuals,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.880]   and one individual, yes, although it is better than nothing,
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.560]   if he calls me, I will go.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:27.480]   It is shy of the true servant's heart, right?
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.760]   Because one person is waiting for,
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.120]   is he gonna tell me to go?
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.640]   I guess I'm willing.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.520]   The other person is like, what would you like me to do?
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.560]   I'm ready to go.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.480]   Do you want me to go?
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.320]   I'll go, right?
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.600]   Like, another person is looking for the opportunities,
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.080]   not waiting for a sign, a call, or a specific word,
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:51.600]   but this individual is looking to please.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.220]   So in 1 Thessalonians chapter four, verse one,
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.320]   here's an important passage for us on this topic.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.600]   The servant is looking to please.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.200]   It says, finally then, brethren,
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.320]   we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus,
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.660]   that as you receive from us instruction
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.540]   as to how you ought to walk and please God,
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.120]   just as you actually do walk, so they're already doing it.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.200]   He says, I want you to excel still more.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.920]   Wow.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.820]   It is on you to look for those opportunities
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.000]   to do that which you're already convinced
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.600]   pleases the heart of the Father.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:32.280]   You're not waiting for, can you do this now?
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.000]   Because you're already looking.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.140]   That's the heart of the servant.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.540]   Now, we ask this question,
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.680]   we know we should be in a heart posture
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.040]   where it's like, Lord, I want to do your will.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.000]   I want to serve your kingdom.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.380]   And yes, you have this masterful plan of salvation.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:51.660]   Yes, it's difficult, but I'm willing.
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.560]   What prevents us from being there as true servants?
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.460]   And here I want to bring up an interesting question to you.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.920]   Do you currently feel like
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.120]   you have way too much going on in your life?
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.360]   Do you currently feel like there are so many to-dos
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.860]   on your list of tasks that you're just kind of praying,
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.400]   like, Lord, help me?
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.820]   Are you one of those people where sometimes you've prayed,
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.980]   like, God, please just help me get through the day?
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:25.040]   Now, to that, if you're feeling like that today
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.080]   and you're here, my sympathies to you.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.480]   Some days I feel like,
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.220]   you know, you're aghast.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.480]   You're just saying, God,
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.280]   give me strength to finish off the week.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.220]   There's just been so much going on.
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.020]   So tired, okay?
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:46.280]   So as a sympathetic word to you, be careful.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.080]   If you allow yourself to continue to pray
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.520]   nothing but, Lord, help me survive.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.600]   God, help me get through the week.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.520]   Please give me strength to do this and that,
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.900]   and I've got, oh my gosh,
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.880]   I got, like, oil change to do on the car
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.760]   and kids to take to soccer practice,
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.320]   and I gotta meet up with these people,
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.820]   and I gotta prepare for this plan,
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.660]   and then next thing you know,
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.040]   I'm like, school's gonna start,
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.200]   and this job is moving,
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.160]   and da-da-da-da-da is happening.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.440]   All of a sudden, what you will find
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.540]   is that you are starting to treat God
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.320]   like an executive assistant.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.600]   You're the executive, he's your assistant,
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.920]   and most of your prayers have to do with,
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.600]   help me get the stuff in my life done.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.160]   I find that this is a danger
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.360]   of modern-day life as a Christian.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.620]   We are so busy, amen?
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.760]   Again, this is not to just put guilt,
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.040]   because sometimes the good things,
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.560]   where we have both opportunity, time,
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.500]   and we're trying to fill our lives with good things,
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.360]   but all of a sudden, majority of our prayers
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.720]   sound like, God, here are the tasks,
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.240]   I need this, this, this, and this, and this.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.080]   Help me.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.320]   Who's assisting who?
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.360]   Who is assisting who?
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.000]   But the heart of the servant has said,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.880]   God, I've got, like, what bond servant,
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.160]   what slave says, God, Master, Lord, Father,
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.440]   I've got all this stuff going on.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.320]   Please don't add stuff to my plate right now,
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.360]   I can't do it, right?
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.920]   What slave says, Master,
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.720]   can you help me get all this stuff done?
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.160]   The slave is saying, God, I'm willing to clear,
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.280]   I am willing to clear my schedule for you.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.880]   I've been watching you work over there,
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.680]   can I do that, knowing still,
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.720]   you have an endless amount of things to do.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.840]   You know why?
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.080]   Because the role of the slave is permanent.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.680]   Listen to this, 2 Corinthians chapter four, verse five,
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.760]   Apostle Paul gives a perspective of himself,
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.240]   and he says, for we do not preach ourselves,
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.200]   but Jesus Christ as Lord.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:46.320]   And then he says, and ourselves as your bond servants
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.620]   for Jesus' sake.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.440]   Notice what he did there.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.880]   Because he is a bond servant to Christ,
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.960]   he is also a servant to the church,
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.200]   to the people of God, amen?
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.720]   But the idea of bond servant,
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:02.000]   here is the official book definition
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   of the word bond servant, doulos.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.560]   It is a permanent relationship of servitude.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:13.080]   That is not a, once I get my stuff done,
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.600]   once this season is good.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.080]   It says, in this discretionary definition,
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.340]   the will of the slave is altogether consumed
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.100]   in the will of the master.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:27.980]   The servant is bound to serve.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:31.820]   The synonym for a bond servant is just slave.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.980]   When was the last time the slave was like,
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.580]   I'm just so busy.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:40.780]   I'll get to your priorities
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.220]   when this season of life is better.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:47.480]   The servant's heart is looking to please God today.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:51.520]   The servant of God is looking to please at all times,
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.840]   watching the Father and saying, do you need this?
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.680]   How can I serve you?
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.400]   Who do you want me to serve?
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.280]   He is on the ready, looking.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:02.600]   Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians chapter four,
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.200]   verse one through two, Apostle Paul says,
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.840]   let a man regard us in this manner,
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.660]   as servants of Christ, stewards of the mysteries of God.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.820]   In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.960]   that one be found trustworthy.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.740]   Trustworthy.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:23.760]   I gotta be honest, my memory stinks.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.400]   I apologize to all of you who have ever messaged me
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.240]   and I have not replied.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.200]   I also apologize if you've ever asked me to do something
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.020]   and I have not been found trustworthy
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:37.300]   because I am too absent-minded or preoccupied.
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.580]   Why do I say that?
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.500]   I was thinking about the servant's serving attitude.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.660]   If I can't serve you,
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.760]   I'm probably doing the same thing with God.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.700]   And I don't want to.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:53.980]   In my heart, I have a deep desire to be trustworthy.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:58.340]   You know, when I was saved as a young high school student,
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.240]   as a junior, I gotta be honest,
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.540]   my older brother took me to church
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:06.300]   and I was kind of dumbfounded and scared by the people.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.860]   I was saved as a young student
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.880]   in the midst of a revival generation
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.900]   where every Saturday was massive revival, but I loved it.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.920]   And the reason why was because at first,
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.860]   I heard the people pray and they were praying with passion.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:24.860]   God, I surrender everything, whatever you ask, I'll do it.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.880]   I'll give up my life, I'll sell my possession,
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.120]   whatever you ask, I'll do it.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.760]   And they were praying.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.440]   And they were praying, just use me, God,
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.720]   use me for whatever you want.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.960]   First, as a non-Christian,
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.840]   all of that sounded crazy and cultish, right?
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.780]   People saying, just use me, take me.
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:45.580]   It's just complete surrender and you're like,
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.420]   I'm outta here.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:50.540]   But then I remember once I heard the gospel
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.220]   and the pastor took interest in me
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:56.500]   to ask me about my own sin, my regrets,
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.100]   and I received the weight of grace,
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.460]   I was saying the same thing.
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:05.060]   And I remember just saying to God, I surrender everything.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.820]   And I remember the very first song
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.240]   that I learned on the little guitar,
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.460]   it was three chords, actually, not four, three chords,
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:15.860]   D, B minor, and G, he just repeated over.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:16.900]   But the song was so simple,
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.780]   I actually tried to find it for the sermon
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:21.460]   and I actually couldn't find who wrote it.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.860]   It's just simply called Here I Am.
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.780]   Super short chorus, and that's it,
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.660]   the whole song is just a little chorus.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:30.300]   Here I am, nothing much to give to you.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:34.960]   But here I am, asking for the privilege to be used.
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:37.760]   To be used by you.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:43.900]   Use me, dear Lord, make my life a living sacrifice.
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:49.420]   Use me, dear Lord, to be a light in the darkest night.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:52.260]   Lord, for your glory.
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.100]   And as good charismatics, we're just saying that
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.160]   over and over and over again.
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:03.300]   But to this day, that to me has been my mantra.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.140]   And I wanna ask you, amongst all the things you're praying,
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.500]   have you recently prayed, God, use me?
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:20.340]   To whatever degree, doesn't have to be A, B, or C.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.580]   Use me to your good pleasure.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:24.680]   I wanna see you happy.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.700]   I wanna refresh the saints and make them happy.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.700]   Just use me for your glory, for the glory of your kingdom,
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.820]   your church, your son, just use me.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:40.020]   I pray that that would be our heart
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.240]   because that would make us bold.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:46.180]   That would make our eyes open to see what he's doing.
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.060]   And even if what he's doing doesn't make sense
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.160]   to everybody else, we'd be on the ready.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.480]   Moving to my third point then,
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.480]   the true servant is satisfied when he is used, amen?
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.580]   The true servant who has the right posture and attitude,
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.420]   when he is used by God, he's filled with joy.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.620]   When he knows in his mind that this is the will of God
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.980]   and he's doing exactly the will of God,
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.300]   he's both content, secure, and he's sure of himself.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.300]   There is a level of confidence you can't give,
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.780]   but only comes from someone knowing
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.820]   I'm doing the will of God.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.180]   And that's boldness.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.440]   I will be honest with you, life has been incredibly busy
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.240]   for years for me.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.360]   For years, it's just been incredibly busy.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.680]   But I've been so blessed because I get to do
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.240]   as much ministry as my heart wants.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   I have so much freedom here and now, I'm so happy.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.160]   If I ever complain to you about my job,
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.980]   you have permission to rebuke me.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.760]   But kindly, okay?
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.480]   But let me give you some words on how I want you
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.320]   to rebuke me.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.460]   If you ever hear me say, "Ugh, I'm meeting too many people.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.840]   "Ugh, I don't wanna go to the mall."
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.400]   Or, "Ugh, why do I have to go on this mission trip?"
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.520]   If I ever do that in front of you,
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.200]   I want you to look at me, shake your head,
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.280]   and go, "I thought you were a player."
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.320]   And walk away.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.800]   And I would know right away what you mean,
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.200]   I'll bow my head and confess, I'll repent, and I'll be good.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.560]   What do I mean by that?
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.960]   I thought you were a player.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   Imagine with me a child who is learning basketball,
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.660]   and he joins a basketball league, and he joins a team.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.600]   But then upon the coach giving him minutes,
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.640]   all of a sudden, the student, the child is complaining,
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.300]   "I wanted to start off the bench.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.160]   "Why'd you make me start?"
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.880]   And the coach is like, "Hey, hey, I need you."
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.720]   And he's like, "Oh my goodness, all I have
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.620]   "is like three minutes in me.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.520]   "I can't play 10 minutes."
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.640]   The coach is like, "Dude, the game is like 40 minutes.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.840]   "What's wrong with you?"
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.380]   And the student's like, "Why are you giving me the ball?
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.800]   "Giving me like 20 shots?
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.340]   "What the heck is this?"
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.680]   Okay, no student ever said that.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.160]   No player in the game is complaining
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.560]   that he's getting minutes.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.520]   His complaint is, "Why aren't you giving me more minutes,
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.340]   "coach, I'm ready.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.120]   "Give me the ball, give me that rock.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.240]   "I'll take the first shot, the last shot, every shot."
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.840]   Why, because he's a player.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.640]   If I'm complaining, that must mean
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.880]   that I'm like one of those kids
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.980]   where his parents forced him.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.360]   Like his mama was saying, "You need to do a sport
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.500]   "'cause you're fat and lazy.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.340]   "Do a sport."
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:37.680]   And he's like, "Oh, Mom, I don't wanna be that kid."
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.520]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.720]   If I ever complain, no longer do I have
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.040]   the heart of a servant.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.840]   I have a heart of a grumbling child
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.680]   who's being forced to do something I know is good for me.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.400]   And those are two incredibly different heart attitudes,
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.240]   amen?
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.880]   Well, there are a lot of Christians.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.600]   Sometimes, admittedly so, where we're just doing things
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.640]   'cause I know it's good for me, but there's no heart in it.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.560]   And you know what it's like.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.000]   Have you ever taught a child?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.400]   You know they don't wanna do it,
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.820]   so at every step, you have to give another instruction.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:16.240]   Do your homework, write your name, do the first question,
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.440]   show your work, stop writing so nasty
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.960]   like you're writing with your toes.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.520]   And every step of the way, you have to give them instruction
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.920]   because they're doing it because they know it's good
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.240]   and they have to.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.480]   There's no heart behind that.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:36.220]   Brothers and sisters, is that the way our heart is?
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:39.800]   If so, that is not God's design for you.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.840]   God's design for you is to be satisfied in the work, amen?
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.400]   God's design for you is to have your heart filled
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.860]   because you're doing something valuable, worthy,
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.440]   and that which is glorious to God Almighty.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.400]   And that is for every single one of you.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.400]   Now, do I believe every single one of you
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.360]   should be a missionary?
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.960]   The answer is no.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.840]   If you heard a pastor say that,
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.240]   it's because he's just using it
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.280]   in the broadest sense possible.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.840]   You are, by God's design, a vessel of truth, amen?
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.720]   So every single one of you, yes,
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.120]   you actually signed off on it, if you remember.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.520]   Point number nine, covenant, nine.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.320]   I commit to sharing the gospel both locally and globally.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.360]   And yes, you are the missionary in the broadest sense
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.720]   because you are a witness.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.240]   If there was a trial going on,
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   you are the person who is supposed to come on scene
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.500]   and say, I saw something, what did you see?
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:34.480]   I was a crazy sinner living for myself,
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.880]   but God broke me and then he had mercy on me.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.780]   He's so good.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:41.620]   That's your testimony, amen?
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.040]   Every single one of you is supposed to carry that.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.560]   There is no Christian who's supposed
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.380]   to be silent about that.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.440]   But not every Christian is supposed
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.620]   to be an official missionary
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.680]   because there's qualifications for that,
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.120]   because there's gifting for that,
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.560]   because there's opportunity for that,
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.600]   because there are commissioning from the church for that.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.880]   There are various things.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.600]   That's just like basketball, okay?
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.700]   Every single one of you is on the team.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:09.920]   Not every single one of you needs to be center, right?
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.720]   Those of you guys who understand basketball,
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.600]   there's a huge guy in the middle
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.480]   whose main job is to rebound,
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.520]   whose main job is to get the easy buckets,
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.780]   and he's running the offense from the center.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.080]   Not every single one of you is supposed to be point guard,
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.560]   but every single one of you
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.040]   should know how to dribble and pass, right?
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.080]   That all makes sense.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.160]   Why am I saying this?
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.880]   It's because whatever you're doing,
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.160]   you should be happy to play,
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.120]   happy to dribble, happy to pass.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120]   But you have to be ready,
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.680]   and you have to have that eager servant's heart.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.380]   If the coach asks you to play point, play point.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:54.040]   If some of you in here have already discounted
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.180]   the opportunity for you to do more for the Lord,
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.480]   go out on an evangelistic event.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.720]   Go out and try short term missions in the summer,
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.880]   and you just automatically said, "That's not for me,"
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.420]   don't do that.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:11.000]   Have the servant's heart to be like, "Oh, shoot.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.280]   "You want me to try?
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.680]   "It would make me so happy,
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.840]   "'cause I'm trying these different positions,
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.040]   "and I'm actually learning."
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.860]   This is the natural steady growth of a Christian.
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:23.200]   You're doing the daily disciplines,
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.680]   you're reading and growing in knowledge,
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.280]   and then you're growing in the disciplines,
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   and you're seeing how God would use you in the church,
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.680]   and that the church affirms you,
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.180]   and the church sees your skill,
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.840]   the church sees your giftings,
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.360]   and then they give you more opportunity,
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.700]   and that God has said, "He who is faithful little,
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.120]   "more will be added unto you as a servant of God."
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.120]   Do not hold yourself as the consultant to God,
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.160]   and be like, "No, you can't use me."
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.000]   Don't do that.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.020]   Be willing in your heart.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:51.860]   Why?
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.800]   The true servant is satisfied
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.980]   to whatever degree God uses them.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.680]   Small or big.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.360]   Official, non-official.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.980]   Specific point, or just a member of the team.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.960]   The true servant is satisfied
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.280]   to whatever degree God uses them.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.680]   To make this point, I go to a strange passage,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.480]   strange, I think you guys probably know it,
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.440]   but strange in the sense
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.880]   that I had such a hard time imagining it.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.760]   Acts chapter five, verse 40.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.240]   Acts chapter five, verse 40.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.800]   They, that's the Sanhedrin,
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.120]   they took the advice,
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.580]   and after calling the apostles in,
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.120]   they flogged them,
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.860]   and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus,
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:37.840]   and then released them.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.000]   You guys know what flogging is?
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.040]   You guys have probably heard that
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.720]   because Jesus was whipped.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.920]   You guys have heard that there is a device,
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.040]   basically it's just a whip,
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.800]   but sometimes they call it the cat of nine tails,
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.560]   or they have different terms for it.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.560]   They would have multiple strands of leather,
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.640]   and on it they would embed bone,
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.680]   sharp stones, rocks, and metal beads.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.520]   Why?
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.000]   Because they would beat the person.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.040]   Did you know that in common flogging,
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.440]   they would beat the person front and back,
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.280]   and they would rip chunks of skin away from their bodies?
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.600]   You know that many people did not survive
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.200]   because of the amount of bleeding that would happen.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.160]   People who were flogged were permanently scarred for life.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.120]   They were deformed.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.320]   It's so crazy to think that,
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.280]   try to imagine it,
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.880]   and then read the next verse.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.240]   So, they went on their way
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.600]   from the presence of the council,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.680]   rejoicing that they had been considered
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:41.200]   worthy to suffer the shame for his name.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.160]   And every day,
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.920]   in the temple and from house to house,
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.520]   they kept right on preaching and teaching
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.880]   Jesus as the Christ.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880]   Oh my gosh.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.400]   How do you,
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.920]   how do you picture, like meditate,
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.440]   like the whole story?
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.040]   I mean, how scary would you be
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.800]   if you had the authorities,
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.840]   the whole council rebuking you?
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.080]   You better be quiet!
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.320]   And it wasn't just a verbal threat.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.600]   It wasn't just time in the cell.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.520]   They beat you to death.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.440]   And then all the disciples come together and say,
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.000]   "We got to serve him."
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.520]   Do you see that?
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.360]   They mocked us.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.480]   They called us little Christians.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.640]   And then they said, "Let's do it again."
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.320]   That is the heart of a servant that has joy,
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.480]   and the joy to the degree that they shared
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.560]   in the sufferings together.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.520]   It's really hard to picture, isn't it?
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.080]   But brothers today,
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.120]   brothers and sisters today,
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.320]   we're imagining we want to be that bold.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.600]   We want to have that kind of servant's heart
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.920]   looking for the joy.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.000]   We, you and I, look for this joy
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.360]   set before us when God, our Savior,
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.720]   Christ, our King, would look at us and say,
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.560]   "Well done.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.600]   "Well done, my faithful servant."
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.400]   We can start having those moments of joy today.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.800]   By way of conclusion,
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.280]   there is another passage in Acts chapter 21
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.880]   to circle our thoughts.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.000]   I got to be just honest with you.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.800]   Last week, Pastor Peter mentioned it,
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.360]   and I guess kind of meditation on the thought.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.640]   He said, "We are in a unusual, abnormal time."
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.320]   In previous generations,
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.720]   if they said, "I'm going across the seas to do missions,"
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.440]   that means you're not coming back.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.680]   But in our generation, one week, go, come back.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.240]   No threats.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.440]   We have it so good, right?
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.000]   And I got to say,
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.320]   I'm confessing that it's hard for me to imagine
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.400]   and put myself in these disciples' shoes
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.320]   when they are joyful that they suffer
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.160]   for the name of Jesus.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.800]   I'm going to be honest, it's hard, yes?
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.760]   But nevertheless, I am so challenged,
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.560]   and I am so moved.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.760]   This is a moving verse.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.960]   This is a radically challenging verse.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.600]   Acts chapter 21, verse 12.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:17.440]   He is with a prophet and some of the disciples.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.360]   Apostle Paul says,
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.640]   "When," or this is actually the author saying,
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.200]   "When we heard this,
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.880]   "we as well as the local residents began begging him
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.120]   "not to go up to Jerusalem."
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.160]   Okay, just putting in context,
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.600]   Apostle Paul is traveling.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:35.640]   He leaves Ephesus and prays with the Ephesus elders.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.240]   He's crying and he's going on his journey.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.080]   Upon coming here, the leaders of the church
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.800]   and also a prophet essentially says,
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.640]   "Let me see your belt,"
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.280]   takes off the belt, binds his leg,
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.080]   and says, "You're going to die like this.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.600]   "They're going to bind you.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.520]   "If you go to Jerusalem, you're a dead man."
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.840]   Paraphrase.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.240]   And that's why the others are like,
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.920]   "Don't go.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.360]   "Do not go there."
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.760]   Look what Apostle Paul says.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.840]   "Then Paul answered, 'What are you doing?'
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.640]   "Weeping and breaking my heart.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.800]   "For I am ready not only to be bound,
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.240]   "but even to die at Jerusalem
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.520]   "for the name of the Lord Jesus.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.960]   "And since he would not be persuaded,
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.640]   "we fell silent,
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.320]   "remarking the will of the Lord be done."
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.720]   Wow.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.560]   Take a moment to imagine that scene.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.880]   The loving fellow brothers is like,
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.040]   "What are you, you can't go there?
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.720]   "Do you know what he just said?
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.840]   "Look at you, you're already beat.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.880]   "Look at you, you're like damaged.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.280]   "What are you doing?"
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.920]   Probably had all of these rationales like,
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.040]   "You could do more over here
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.360]   "and you could do this over there."
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.400]   Apostle Paul believed in the absolute sovereignty of God.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.680]   Right?
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.800]   And that is so challenging for us.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.800]   Now, saints of old,
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.600]   and we've heard here of saints even today,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.160]   people who will sacrifice everything,
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.120]   sell their business,
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.080]   people who are athletes and millionaires saying,
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.560]   "You know what, forget that.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.000]   "I'm gonna go serve the Lord."
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.280]   That is so challenging.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.640]   Now, at the same time,
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   we don't want to put them in a different class.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.320]   When you read Apostle Paul's words,
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.440]   is he superhuman?
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.400]   Is he just a different breed?
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.120]   Is he just built different?
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.960]   No.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.920]   He keeps telling us, "I'm just a servant."
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:34.880]   My guess is, God just kept showing him his word,
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.440]   showed him a vision of the gospel and kingdom ministry,
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.240]   and to this, Apostle Paul said,
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.680]   "Let the will of God be done.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.160]   "I trust him.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.480]   "I trust the master.
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.040]   "He is king of the field.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.800]   "If we sow the seed, he will make the growth."
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.640]   Amen?
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.160]   And that is the heart of the servant.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.120]   Let the will of the Lord be done.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:57.960]   Let's pray.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:03.720]   Heavenly Father,
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:10.160]   sometimes, God, we do have a hard time
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:15.160]   sympathizing and relating to the apostles of the scripture,
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:19.400]   but God, they were men who were your bond servants,
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.880]   and we, likewise, we're the children of your kingdom.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.240]   We have the spirit of God,
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:32.920]   and we, too, want to grow in our heart of service to you.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.440]   We want to grow, Lord God, in our heart and perspective
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.400]   of being about your kingdom and your work,
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.480]   so I pray that for every single one of us individually,
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.960]   we do ask, God, that you would use us,
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.840]   and then, as a church, Lord,
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:51.880]   use us mightily for your glory and kingdom.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.240]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.640]   - Let us stand for the closing praise.
