[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   We gotta start like right now?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   So, Johnny, let's pray together and then we'll start here.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Heavenly Father, thank you that we're here listening to your word.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Thank you God that we're here as a church.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Thank you for these seminars that have been prepared.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   But more than anything, God, we always want to thank you in every prayer for the gift of your Son,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   by which everything else we pray matters.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And so God, we give this time to you,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   that it be a time where we understand what it means to be Christians, to be peacekeepers,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   to be pursuers of peace in the midst of conflict and sin,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   and that we would desire this because this is the type of God that you are.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Okay.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Well, oh, that's awesome.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   So, I've been working feverishly to cut this down.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   We're going to be moving very quick today.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   So, there might be some things that we kind of skip over, some things that we gloss over.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   My ask of you is to take as much of the principles that you can,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and it's going to be your job to apply them to your life.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So, we're going fast because I actually have like 63 slides,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   which probably we're not going to get through, because we don't have enough time.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   But let's start with the first.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So, you're a peacemaker, resolving personal conflict.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I have the definition written down for you already on the worksheet.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's indifference and opinion are purpose to frustrate someone's goals or desires.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So, if you think about that, try not to, yeah, I'll kind of cue you.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So, variations and tastes that might create conflict, if you think about it.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   For those of you who are married, you might have seen that in a lot of your vacation.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   You go to a vacation and one of you just wants to stay at the hotel and watch TV and sleep in,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and the other one wants to go and see everything, see the world.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   From top to bottom, you have it all packed, and it creates conflict.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   There's hostile arguments when you're fighting and quarreling with people.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   That's maybe the type of thing that you're kind of thinking of as you're thinking of resolving personal conflict.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   But the one thing about conflict that's for sure is that you can't dodge it in life.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And I think there are multiple ways that people do try to dodge it.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   First, they'll try to dodge it by ridding your surroundings of people of conflict.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So, if you just stay away from people who will create conflict in your life,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   if I avoid them, then maybe I can dodge conflict.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Another way is by being a good person.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   If you're thinking, if I can just be a good person, then maybe I can dodge conflict in life.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And in the middle of that, even then, we think that maybe turning to God, whatever that means, will make everything better.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We have to think a little bit more sophisticated than that, the Hukouki speaking.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And so, this is not true.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   We know that in a sinful world, we're going to be coming up against conflict with every person that we come across in many different types of ways.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And so, with this notion that there is going to be conflict, when it inevitably comes, how are you going to deal with it as a believer?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's what we're going to be addressing today.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And so, hopefully, this conflict is going to lead to reconciliation, whether in major or minor ways.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And with that, we're going to be looking at four primary causes of conflict.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So, the first one, we can go to the next slide here.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Oh, I forgot about this one.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Well, this is the reason why we're doing this.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   This is Vision 3 to Glorify God by building a community through love and accountability.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And to really want to build a community, you know, you think of coming to church,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and when you kind of think about what church is, you want it to be a place where everyone's kind of holding hands and singing together,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and smiling, and happy all the time.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   But as soon as you have a church that's actually like that, you have to kind of question,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   is this a church that has gone deep into relationships?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Because as soon as you do, you know, again, for you married couples,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   it might have been okay to get married, and then you'd be able to see all these different parts, all these different things.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Maybe even for people who have ever dated, you're like, "Oh, this is the perfect guy. He's the perfect girl. He's the one I want to marry."
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   But when you get into it, you're like, "Wow, he's disgusting," or whatever it might be.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So when you start building a community, when you start getting deeper into your relationships,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   this concept of loving one another and holding each other accountable gets into a place where things get sticky.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And so reconciliation is going to be necessary, peace-making is going to be necessary,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   because we are going to be seeing people with different mentalities.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   We're going to be addressing that a little bit.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So what are the four primary causes of conflict?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   The first one is our misunderstandings.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So Joshua 22, verse 10 through 34, we can't have you turn there right now,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   but if you remember the story of nine and a half tribes and two and a half tribes,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   it was Agad, Reuben, and a half tribe of Manasseh.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   They were kind of divided up, and what happened was, because this was after the time of all the conquerings,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   of the time of Joshua, into the land of Canaan, a time of peace was beginning to come rolling in.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And so with all the conquering of the land, they began to distribute which land belongs to which tribe.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So two and a half of the tribes were separated pretty far past this Jordan River, which was the eastern part.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So there was the western Israel and the eastern Israel, as well as the north and south.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So the eastern people were like, "Oh man, this river is going to stop us."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And so what they did was they erected an altar.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And so if you think about where an altar is supposed to go, that's supposed to stay at the holy land.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   That's supposed to be over there.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And so when they made it, nine and a half tribes came up in arms,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and they came up against this border and said, "What are you doing? We declare war on you."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And what happened in that setting was the two and a half tribes were like, "Whoa, this is a miscommunication.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   We know that this is an altar that's supposed to take care of that.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   This is actually an inaugural altar.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And this altar is supposed to be here to remind your children and our children, way past the time when we're gone,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   that we have an understanding that we are the same people, of the same God."
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And so a misunderstanding could produce a conflict.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Secondly, differences in values.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Differences in values.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   In Acts 15.39, this is a very famous passage where Paul and Barnabas, who were doing missionary journeys together,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   they separate because Barnabas wanted to take John Mark, and then Paul wanted to take Silas.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And so regardless of what was going on there, it was definitely a difference in value that was happening.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And so that caused a conflict between the two.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Third, conflict could be caused by competition over limited resources.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   So in Genesis 13, 1 through 12, there's the story of Abraham and Lot, and their herdsmen, their people,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   are kind of fighting against each other because they have big flocks,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   and they're fighting against the same land, so Abraham says, "Okay, you choose the land you want to go to,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   and I'll go to my own land."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So that was kind of a conflict.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And fourthly, this is the obvious one, sinful attitudes or habits will cause conflict.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And most of the time, all these things are kind of playing with each other.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   In Galatians 5.15, it's that passage where it says, "But if you bite and devour one another,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   watch out that you are not consumed by one another."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And these people are fighting each other because of their sinfulness.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Now, why is it so important for the church to learn to reconcile alone?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Well, this is our theme passage.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I didn't realize it would be, but it's the same one.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   But in Philippians 1.27-5, it says, "Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   so that whether I come and see you or amass it, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   one mind, striving side by side with the faith of the gospel, and not frightened in anything by your opponents.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ, you should not only believe in Him, but also suffer for His sake.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Engage in the same conflict that you saw I had, and now hear that I still have."
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   any affection and sympathy, complete my joy of being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and having one mind, do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And then verse 6-11 talks about that passage with Christ's humility, where He doesn't grasp the deity, to His Godhood,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   and instead He dies on the cross for us, and then He's exalted.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So this passage, if you look at it as a whole, you begin to see a lot of this unity talk.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It talks about being of one spirit, one mind, it says that we're engaged in the same conflict.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It says, Damian 2, verse 2, "Complete my joy of being of the same mind again, same love, full accord, one mind."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Verse 3 and 4 talks about what that looks like, do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   count others more significant than yourselves, don't look only to your own interests, but the interests of others.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And this all has this unity talk, all has a purpose behind it.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And you can kind of glean some of the purpose, in verse 27 it says, "Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ."
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   It has something to do with the gospel that comes through Christ.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   That the gospel is going to make it so that this unity is very, very important.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And then if you continue to read down, even in verse 28, you see, "This is a clear sign to them of their destruction."
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   What's it talking about?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Christian unity is going to signal to other people destruction, but of us, of our salvation.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   So this unity has something to say about our salvation, that in ending saved people, a unification happens.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And then in verse 5, if you can't be clear enough, "Have this mind among yourselves."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And on this, this humble talk, before and after this passage in verse 5, it says, "This is yours in Christ Jesus."
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   "Have the mind of Christ," is what it says.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   So, it's so important for the church to learn to reconcile well.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Unity is very, very important to our gospel proclamation.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   That if this is gone, that the power of salvation that's given to us, and that message we proclaim to the world,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   is not only going to be diluted, but we do the exact opposite of what we want to do to the world.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   So, if we're out there, you know, proclaiming the gospel to our co-workers, and to our friends, and to our non-believing family members,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and yet we are in conflict with someone, and we have no desire to resolve, no desire to reconcile,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and we're just bitter at heart and mind, and there's a division in the church because of this.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Or maybe even within the church, maybe you look across the aisle, and there's somebody that just drives you crazy.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   But you just decide, "I hope you avoid them all my life."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   If that happens, we are doing a disservice to the gospel, because it means that we haven't fully understood what it means in our own lives,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   what God has done for us.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   So, in John 13, 35, it says, "By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   That's how people will know, by the love that we have for one another.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Alright.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   So, again, in this seminar, it's going to be very important for you to understand that we can't go into it case by case.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   We're going to be throwing out there a lot of principles, and so there might be a conflict that you're thinking of in your mind,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and it might not fit perfectly with some of the things that we're bringing up.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   But you're going to have to do the legwork of kind of drawing the principles and the biblical principles to what's going to work for you in your case.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Okay?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   So, before we go into the main part of it, I want to ask you to think of some conflicts that you've been in recently.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   This is going to be very helpful for you as we continue this seminar.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Okay?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I'll give you like ten seconds to think of a conflict.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   It could be small, it could be big.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And as you think of that, think of how you generally respond to conflicts like this.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Okay?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   So, maybe in this conflict, how are you responding to it?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Or in the past, how have you responded to it?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   So, if you don't have one, as an important example, you still have to use your imagination, but if you get into an argument with a friend,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and you're visibly frustrated with your friend, and you feel it,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   their smiling face just makes you angry for some reason.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   So, you're frustrated.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   How do you respond to that?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   What do you do to your friend?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   So, do you stop talking with them?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Do you just avoid the topic of whatever that topic is?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Those are the kinds of things that you need to think of.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Alright, go to the next slide.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And then the next slide after that.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Okay, this is called the slippery slope.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   So, you're going to see three on this side, six in the middle, three on this side.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And I'm going to kind of take you guys through this.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   So, on the left side there, it's called peace faking.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   You're going to see denial, flight, and suicide.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Alright, so peace faking.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   The first one is denial.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   I'll just drop that one down.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And this is like someone who says, if you've ever met someone, like my dad was like this.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Like he'd get a really bad injury, and then I said, "Dude, Dad, you should go to the doctor for that."
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   He said, "No, no, no, go away."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   That's not going to go away.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   You've got to go to the doctor.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Your finger's going to come off, that kind of thing.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And so, it's a person who just says, "If I don't think about it, it will get better."
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   That's what denial is.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And so, this is peace faking.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   You're just pretending that peace is there, even though it's not actually there.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   So, in conflict, it's that person who says, "It's going to be okay,"
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and that this situation will resolve over time,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   that I don't really want to deal with it or talk about it right now.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And all the while, it's getting worse.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And while you're pretending that it's okay,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   probably the relationship is beginning to poison,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   your heart is starting to get hardened,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   and a myriad of other things.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   The second one is flight.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   So, it's pulling away from a relationship, quitting a job, filing for divorce, changing churches.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Flight might be legitimate in extreme circumstances.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   You guys can look at these passages on your own.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   I'm sorry we can't.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   But an extreme circumstance could be some kind of physical abuse,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   or maybe you're flying from a conflict because you need some time to air it out.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   You're not thinking clearly, so you need to breathe, pray.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   So, there might be some circumstances for flight.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   But in most cases, it only postpones a proper solution to the problem.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And in a church, usually as far as it gets after some kind of fight,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   it will be a change in the church.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And you see that.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   So, people will be like, "I can't deal with this.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I just don't feel safe at church anymore."
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And they'll say things like that.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And so, they will move churches instead of reconcile.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And at the next church, pretend like, "I can just go on with my life."
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Third one is suicide.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   We don't need to talk about this one too much.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   But if it gets far enough, it can go to that side.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Now, next slide.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   On the spectrum, we're going to be looking at the right side now.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And the right side is peace breaking.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It all rhymes if you remember.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Peace breaking, peace breaking, assault, litigation, and murder.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   So, these are attack responses aside from the escape responses.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So, next slide.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   First is assault.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   So, assault is using various forms of force or intimidation, such as verbal attacks.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   This includes gossip.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   This includes slander.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Physical violence or efforts to damage a person financially or professionally.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Such conduct always makes conflicts worse.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   This can also be done under the guise of venting.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I think you guys have already had that.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Small groups are a perfect place to do that.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   You're going to assault someone, but you're doing it in a godly way.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   No, you're assaulting them.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And so, it's gossiping, it's slandering, these kinds of things.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Like, a bunch of you guys are licking each other.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   That's a type of assault, too.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Whatever the case, there's obviously no thought of God.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   You're just sharing because it's heavy on your heart.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You're not even thinking of the other person's well-being.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   You're just saying, "I'm struggling with this."
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   And so, that's not good.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   By the way, you can assault someone while you're smiling.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   That's possible.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   You could just pass by them, pretend like everything's okay.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But it's not, and you are assaulting them in many different ways.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I think the majority of peace-breaking scenarios fall into this category.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   The next one is litigation.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   This is very rare in most church circles, but I've seen it happen.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Coming from a Korean church background, I've seen it happen to a lot of Korean churches around me.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   But litigation has happened where it goes to the court system.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And then lastly, I know it jumps really quick, but a murmur.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   That is the worst way to peace-break.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   It can get pretty bad.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   As humans, we've seen things like this happen all over the news when conflict gets to that point.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   People will murmur.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   You're thinking peace-breaking and peace-breaking and peace-breaking,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   and trying to see where the white category is.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   We're like a generation where we love ISFJ, IDMT.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   We like that kind of stuff. Don't categorize it.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Because it's going to change.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And it's going to be this thing where with a person that you're closer to,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   or maybe someone that you had a relationship with pre-Christianity,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   or it could be a family member, or it could be a new co-worker.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   You could be peace-breaking and just going all over the spectrum.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Instead of peace-making, which is kind of in the middle.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   For example, this is just one example.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   You could be someone who denies, and then you'll flight, flight, flight, flight, flight, to a point.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And then finally, it just gets so out of hand in your mind and heart that you're going to assault.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And then you leave the church. You flight again.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   These things, you can kind of characterize it into however works for you.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Alright, so the next slide here.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And this brings us to peace-making.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   That's right in the middle, and this is where we want to design.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   You don't want to go to this side. You don't want to go to that side.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And what we talk about for the rest of today is going to be about that.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Now a question for you. Don't answer it for real.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   But is conflict always bad?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Does it always stem from sin?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   The answer is no. It is not always bad.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   As we said, the difference in opinions or desires, or even simple miscommunication,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   these things can create that rough of a temptation.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And that in and of itself, what comes out of our hearts might be sinful, but the conflict itself might not.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I like this. I'll meet you. I like this. I'll meet you.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Oh man, you know, like there's a conflict.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   But it's not wrong. You want anything.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   So what we want is to seek unity in our relationships, not uniformity.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   That's important to realize.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   We're not asking everyone to say, "Okay, then we all have to just kind of bow to our own desires and say, 'Whatever you want, go listen.'"
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   That's not what we want.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And so Ephesians chapter 4, verse 1-13, next passage,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   it's kind of a parallel passage to Philippians chapter 1-27, very similar thoughts.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   In verse 1, it says, "I therefore, Christian for the Lord, urge you to watch him and awardly the call of the Lord which you have been called."
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And it kind of describes what that looks like.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   "With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   there is one body and one spirit, just as you were called to, one hope that belongs to your call,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   For grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift."
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   So it talks about what it looks like to walk in a man worthy of a calling.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Unity. Love.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   If the gospel that's been talked about in chapters 1-3 is real to you, then there cannot be division within the church.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And then it talks about the differences in people.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   So we have all these different people, different types of people doing different types of things,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   all doing the work of equipping different types of people.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Alright, next slide.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   So peacemaking.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Now before we go to the first one, let's look at some passages in Matthew.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Okay. I'm just going to have to describe it to you. Do I have that there on your...
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   I do not.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   So in Matthew chapter 5, verses 21-24, you can just write that one down.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   But peacemaking there is necessary in moving the entrances to your church.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   That's the passage where it says, you're at the altar, you're trying to offer up an offering.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And it says, if you have something against a brother, what are you to do?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Leave it at the altar, go to your brother, reconcile, come back, and then offer it.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And you know that when you gave your offering at church?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   This is a really hard thing to do, right?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   But it says that peacemaking is necessary in removing entrances to worship.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Now you could be tempted to just say, I'm not going to think about it, I'll just think about the character of God and worship Him.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   But then there's going to be a big discount for your life.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Because if He is the God that you're worshiping, that has demands on your life,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   and that conflict needs to be resolved.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Because you're thinking, you have forgiven me of my sin.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Praise the Lord, and you're singing with tears flowing down on your face,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   saying, thank you for forgiving me of my sin, thank you for reconciling with me.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And then you turn to your brother, and this guy is far from you,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and you have no desire to go and reconcile with this guy.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And so, we need to be able to do that.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   It is causing a hindrance to your worship.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   In Matthew chapter 18, verses 15-17, this is another thing.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Peacemaking is a command given to reconcile and restore.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   It is a command that ultimately is a tribulation, eventually, as we kind of go.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   But it is a command that we need to reconcile with each other,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   and then restore for all our brothers and sisters.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And the third one comes from Matthew chapter 5, verse 9.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   This is the one where the attitudes, where it talks about blessing, are the peacemakers for,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   they are going to be called what?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Sons of God.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   If you kind of go through, step by step, through the Beatitudes,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   you will see that peacemakers being called sons of God,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   that means, if you want to be seen as a child of God, you need to be a peacemaker.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Or if you flip it, conversely, by being a peacemaker,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   by pursuing a reconciliation, a peace with everyone that we have conflict with,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   they are going to say, that person looks like a Christian.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I see God in that, I see Christ in that person.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Something very different than what the world looks like.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And here are the six categories of peacemaking.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   First, is to overlook an offense.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   In Proverbs 19, it says, "A man's wisdom gives patience, it is his own to overlook an offense."
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   So in peacemaking, sometimes it is okay to just overlook it.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Sometimes, there are going to be things like someone,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   there was this guy, there was this friend that I had,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   who like sniffled like crazy.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   I wanted to sniffle all day, like that, right?
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And it drove me up the wall.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And so, you look at that, it's like, well, it's not, you know,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   this is probably, I just came up with that example, that's a bad example.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   There are little things that drive you crazy, that like,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   that's not his fault, and that's why I just said that example.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   But if it were to be his fault, right?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   There are little things that might come up that you can just,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   well, it's okay, it's not that big of a deal, I'll overlook it.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   It's not really hurting anyone to do that.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And in an overly sensitive culture like today,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   I think this is more than necessary.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Just overlook an offense.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   If someone did something, they said something a little bit,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   maybe, that hurt your feelings.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Okay, that might have happened, and if that happens again,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   maybe you've got to address it.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   But if it was just a passing comment, and they really didn't mean any harm,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   like, you don't have to be like this, like,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   people always go after you, like a vigilante.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I don't know, you don't have to be like this person, like,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   it is my job to track down every single person who says something
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   that will, you know, bother anybody, and kind of call them out on it,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and say, "That's not encouraging like Ephesians 4 says."
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   You know, that's not edifying.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   But we can't imagine a church like that, oh my goodness.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   So sometimes it's okay to overlook an offense.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Secondly, reconciliation.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   So this is a step more now.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   If an offense is too serious to overlook or has damaged the relationship,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   we need to resolve personal and relational issues through confession,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   loving correction, and forgiveness.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And there are a lot of passages about this.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Colossians 3.13 says, "Forgive as the Lord forgave you."
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   That command is, you know, that's just one command.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   But imagine the consequences of that in our lives.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Think about the person you got into conflict with.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   This is going to change the way you live and the way you relate to people.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Thirdly, negotiation.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And then even if we successfully resolve relational issues,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   there might still be some material issues to go over.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   You know, like we might say, "I forgive you."
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   "Oh, sorry, I forgive you too."
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   But afterwards, like that condition is still going to be there, right?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   There's still going to be some residual effect.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And so this is where you need to negotiate.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Hey, next time, maybe if you say it this way,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   it won't have any feel about it.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And maybe if I respond in this manner,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   then you can kind of think about it and say, "Remind me of what we talked about last time."
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   So negotiating is going to be the next step after reconciliation.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   The next one is mediation.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   There's going to be times when you guys are just--
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   you can't come together with agreement, right?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   A third party is going to help you mediate.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Kind of hear both sides and say, "Hey, you're being crazy here.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   You're being unfair here."
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And then that mediator is going to help.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   You'll see examples from that in Matthew 18, 16,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   where it says, "Bring in other parties."
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And then number five is going to be arbitration.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   When you and an opponent cannot come to a voluntary agreement on a material issue,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   you may appoint one or more arbitrators to listen to your arguments
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   and render a binding decision to settle the issue.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And that sounds a little bit like legalese stuff, but this is kind of talking about now--
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   maybe there needs to be someone who says, "Hey, can you just make a decision for us?"
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   In a kind of a simple example, there are two people that are dead set.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Like one person--what do you say?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   One person wants to go to Ruth Chris, one person wants to go to Panera,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and like everyone--they're just dead set on it, right?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And then the third person comes in and says, "Hey, you've got to make a decision for us
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   because we can't make a good decision."
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And then the third person will make that decision.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Number six, accountability.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And that's exactly what it sounds like.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Now, how do we go about peacemaking?
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   How do we pursue reconciliation?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   This is the step-by-step kind of road that you can take--
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   if we go to the next slide here--to pursue peacemaking.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   You can just drop down on the next slide.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   All right, so the first is going to be glorify God.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Second, it's going to be get the log out of your own eye.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Third, it's going to be try to restore.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And fourth, it's going to be reconciled.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   It's called the 4 G's of reconciliation.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Now, this is from a guy named Ken Sandy, who kind of has a ministry all about reconciliation.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And so this is where all of this material is coming from.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   So these 4 G's, I've used them many, many times in my own life to help me,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   and it's been very, very helpful.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   I believe it's very biblical, and I believe that God is glorified through this process.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   So the first one is glorify God.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Next slide.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   All right, so drop down the verse here, please.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Now, we love that passage.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I think we looked at this, and sometimes we say,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   "Well, it can't really mean do everything for the glory of God."
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   But that's what it means.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Do everything for the glory of God.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   So even conflicts, they are to the glory of God.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Conflict provides opportunity to glorify God.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   In every conflict that you come across, whether there's sin involved or whether it's just differences,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   you can actually bring the glory to Him.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Now, example, think about with your parents.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   It doesn't matter how old you are.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   I got that, like, you know, 15-year-old Nathan, I thought, like, that guy was, like, rebellious and stuff.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Even now, when my parents use a certain tone of voice, rebellion erupts in my heart.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And I'm convinced that no matter how old we get, even though we grow in appreciation and we mature a little bit
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   and the gospel has wonders to transform our hearts, there are just certain things.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   When parents say something, I'm like, "Ah!"
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   So it's not easy to be peacemaking with them.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Remember, just denying that a problem exists, that's not enough.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Sometimes the older you get, it gets better at being denied.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   It gets better at, like, just sweeping things under the rug because it's, like, too far gone.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   There's nothing that's going to change them.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   There's nothing that's going to change me in this situation.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   That's a lie.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   The gospel will change us.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And we can glorify God as long as we don't keep running from that situation.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   We have to tackle these things.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Now, so with this example of parents, you can have a natural inclination to rebel against them.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Again, when they use a tone of voice, maybe when they bring up a sore topic.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Maybe when you look at how hypocritical they are, you're like, "Whoa, you're like this."
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Maybe it's the fact that they didn't take time to understand you.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Like, "Why do I have to glorify God in this situation?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   They're not even trying to understand my point of view."
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   We might have these justifications behind it.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   But your sole goal in your relationship, in this relationship that you have with your parents, if there's a conflict, your sole goal is God's glory.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Like, it's sad that, like, I have to remind myself of that, but that's the truth.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   When we talk to our parents and it's making me feel something and sin is starting to come up, what's your goal?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   God's glory. That's what it is.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Glorifying God is the first step in peace making.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   We have to change how we view this.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   It could be a comment about you still being single.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   "How many times have you gotten dumped?"
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   "Are you dating anyone?"
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   You hate, like, family reunions, right?
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Because you're like, "Oh my gosh, is this going to happen again?"
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Like, auntie's going to say this again or whatever.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   It's going to happen.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   About you not having a job you approve of.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   It could be about your weight or your appearance.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   It could be that you think you're too opinionated at the expense of your life.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Even good things.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   "Why are you so involved at church?"
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   "You shouldn't be at a church like that."
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And these things can cause, you know, even these good things.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   "I know I'm right. I shouldn't be going to church. I shouldn't be committed to church."
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   And if there's sinfulness coming out, maybe you are not glorifying God, even though you're doing it in the name of God.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   You have an opportunity in those moments to glorify Him.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Or, if you're not glorifying Him, what's happening?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   You are robbing Him of His glory.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Most likely, you're glorifying yourself.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   This is step one in the most important in Legionary Conflict.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   This is the anchor.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   So what does it mean to glorify God?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Pastor Aaron talked about it a little bit today.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   So, next slide.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   First one is to bring attention to God.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   What does that mean? To bring attention? To display Him? To reveal His perfection?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   His other attributes? That's what it means to glorify Him?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Basically, it's with your own life, it becomes like this compass that points up to God all the time.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   We were created in the image of God.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   What does that mean? We reflect Him.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   What does that mean? When people see us, they see Him.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So we want to be bringing attention to Him.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   If you've ever driven a new car, you don't hide it, right?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   You're not ashamed of the new car.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   So, what happens? You get in this car, and you get that first stop light.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   "Yeah, I'm going to go get a new car."
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   And you want to display Him.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   You don't want to hide who God is.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   You want to glorify Him. You want to bring attention to Him.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   You want to draw eyes to Him through your life and in this conflict.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   So, it's not to win the argument.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   It's not to win in that conflict.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   But it's to bring attention to God.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   That is your dead set on that.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   This is what I'm going to do.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   I want to, in this conflict, to make that other person and everyone around us see who He is.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Secondly, next one, what does it mean to bring glory to God?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It's to please God. That's another way glorifying God happens.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   It goes hand in hand with it.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   How can I please God? How can I honor God in this situation?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   If you are enamored in that conflict of pleasing yourself,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   to get some kind of twisted gratification of yourself,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   then you are glorifying yourself and not God.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Thirdly, emulating God.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Glorifying God has an aspect of this.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   You will emulate the one you desire to glorify.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Pastor Aaron brought up a lot of examples.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   When you see these people, when you see this thing happening,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   and you are worshiping, there is an aspect of glorifying happening here.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   And then...
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I have a passage, I was thinking whether we should go through it or not.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   You can either emulate God, or if you're not emulating God,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   you're emulating something that's not of God.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   You can think about it as worldly or demonic, satanic.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Next passage, in James 3, verse 13-15,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   it talks about the wisdom that comes from above.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And this is in the context of not just your tongue,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   using your words in a very harmful way,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   but also in the context of what's causing division amongst the church.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   People who are quarreling and fighting.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   It says this right in the middle of this.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   "Who is wise in understanding money?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   By his conduct, let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   do not boast that you have lost the truth.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   This is not the wisdom that comes down from above,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   but is earthly and spiritual and demonic."
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And what is saying here in the Little Old Conflict?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   It's saying you can have a heavenly perspective and a heavenly heart,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   or you can be looking like something that is demonic and worldly.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And it doesn't give any option for you.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And so emulating God is going to show this,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   that God will be glorified in a situation like that.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And lastly, is to look at Him.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Looking at God. That's what it means to glorify.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   That you're constantly just set on Him.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Your eyes are fixated upon Him.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Because that is glorifying Him.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   That is the action of what glorifying will do.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Glorifying will make it so that you stare at that thing you're glorifying Him.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I think John Cooper uses a term that I really love.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   He says, "Mom, stare."
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   You're just staring at it.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And so in a position of conflict,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   the temptation is to not look at God, but what happens?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   First thing that probably happens, you're staring at yourself.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Like how you should kind of feel.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   "Ugh, I don't like that."
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   And then what happens?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   You look at the cause of the person that made you feel that way.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   So your eyes drifted on the person.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And then lastly, or if not all, eyes look at God.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   But we flip that all day backwards and say,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   in any conflict what you do is you look at God,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   you long stare at God, you glorify God,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   and then you love that person,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   and then you look at yourself next.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   You are not...
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Your job is not to love yourself.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   But in a conflict that's what we're doing.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   We're just loving ourselves first.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   And in that we're breaking the laws and the prophets, right?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   We're breaking what it means to exist as a Christian.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   I love myself and so I'm going to fight for what I want
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   instead of saying, "Love God, not love yourself."
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   So our eyes are in the wrong places.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Okay.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   We're going to skip all that.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Let's go to the next slide.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Let's skip this one.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Okay.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I have on there for you the trust part, trust in Him,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   but we're going to skip that part.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   We're going to come to these helpful questions.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   These are some things that will help you kind of think through things.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   So number one, who are you estranged with and why?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   So that's going to kind of tell you,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   are there people in your life that you have conflict with?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Secondly, has the peace and unity of the Christian community
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   been disrupted by your dispute?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   So if you're thinking about a dispute with anybody,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   a conflict with anybody, even here at church,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   has the peace and the unity not been broken because of that?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Thirdly, what effect might this dispute have on the reputation
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   of Jesus Christ?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   So if a non-believer were to come in and see
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   and you were to describe to them this conflict,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   what's going to happen to the reputation of Jesus?
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Fourthly, how would your feelings and attitudes and behavior change
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   if you started to see the conflict as an assignment from God?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Now, you have this conflict.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   If God were to say, "Here's what's on your plate,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   what are you going to do with it?"
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   If that happens, how will your attitudes and feelings,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   what will your behavior, what's going to change about it?
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Fifthly, this is the last one we want to take,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and then we'll get to the real thing.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   What good might God be trying to bring into your life
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   if you were to respond in a biblical manner?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   What good might He be trying to bring?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   How is this conflict for your good?
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Because we know that as biblical truth,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   but we don't often see it as that way.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Next slide, and we're going to go on to the second one.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   So the first one was the glorified God.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Now your eyes are on Him.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   All your thoughts are on Him.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   You want Him to be glorified.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   You want Him to be exalted and be set in His majestic place.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Then you draw your attention a little bit
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   and kind of go digging into your heart to see what's going on.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   So get the log out of your own eye.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   I'll instruct the verse now.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   and then you will see clearly to take the speck
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   out of your brother's eye.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   This is from Matthew chapter 7, verse 5.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Don't go to the next passage, just read the whole thing.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   In Matthew 7, it says, "Judge not that you not be judged.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   For with the judgment we pronounce you will be judged.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   And with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Or how can you say to your brother,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   'Let me take the speck out of your eye'
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   when there is the log in your own eye?
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   and then you will see clearly to take the speck
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   out of your brother's eye."
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   So notice how here it doesn't say anything
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   about not taking the speck out of your brother's eye.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   It says you take the thing out of your own eye
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   in order for you to restore your brother as well.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   So in a conflict, it doesn't mean that like,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   no matter the fault of the other person,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   I'm just having to confess everything,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   and then that person can get what he's got free.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   We'll get to that one in the third G.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   So it doesn't forbid correcting another.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Maybe the way you can think about it,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   this is talking about premature judgment and correction.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   So obviously you cannot see another's fault
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   if you have your own sin clouding your vision.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   And if we think about this word right here,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   'hypocrite', if we think of hypocrisy,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   we might think like,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   we might think like,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   don't say anything to someone
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   if I'm suffering the same problem myself.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   So if we talk about dishes,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   like it's a roomie,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   and they're not doing their dishes,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   and you can say,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   with a clear conscience,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   "I'm not being a hypocrite,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   and me being angry with my roomie,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   because I do the dishes."
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   See, if I weren't doing my dishes,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   and then my roomie wasn't doing his dishes,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   and then I was calling out on that,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   that would be hypocrisy, but I'm not.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   But this passage is not talking about something like that.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   This kind of hypocrisy is if you have sin
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   that's coming in your heart.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   So it doesn't have to be the same thing.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   It has to be,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   he's not doing his dishes,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   and it's causing in you anger.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   So you go to them,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   and you say,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   "Do your dishes!"
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   See, that's hypocrisy.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Because you're starting to say,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   "A, Christ would have done the dishes."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   He would have.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   He would have.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   He would have served.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   He washed his disciples' feet
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   while you were being a hypocrite.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Even though it's not the same thing.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Does that kind of make sense?
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Okay.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   Here are two logs to look out for in the next slide.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   The first log is
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   overly critical, negative,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   or overly sensitive attitude.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   So ask yourself,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   do you have those in a conflict?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Do I have an overly critical attitude?
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Do I have a negative attitude?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Do I have an overly sensitive attitude?
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   And maybe a way to kind of summarize this
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   is like, are you being unfaithful?
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   That's a way to think about it.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Now my daughter, Annie, has been driving me crazy.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   She just won't stop talking.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   And it's just, it's not funny anymore.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   So, and then she'll say something,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   and then on top of that,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   what she started doing is like,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   if something happens,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   and she's talking and talking and talking,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   and then it's not going her way,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   she starts to cry.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And that drives me crazy.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Because sensitive people,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   like, that'd be number one.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   People who are overly sensitive,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   if they get too sensitive too quickly,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I go, "Come on, stop that."
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   So with Annie, this is tough, you know?
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   So the other day, what was she doing?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   She was crying in the backseat
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   about the fact that she dropped something.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   And I think it was like a little cracker,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   but she had like 20 more in her hand.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   I was like, "Annie, just get another one.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You have 20 more in your hand.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   We'll pick it up later."
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   And she was crying about the one that she dropped.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   And then I looked back and I said,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   "Annie, stop being a baby!"
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I did it, kind of in an angry voice.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   "Annie, stop being a baby!
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Are you a Hudson? Are you a baby?"
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   And then she started crying more and more.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And I was thinking about it,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   I'm like, "Oh my gosh, she's a baby."
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I'm talking to a three-year-old.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   And I'm saying, "Mature!"
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   And it's like, it's not fair.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   So I think that was a big black for me.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   It's a place where I was being overly critical of Annie,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   and it's not fair.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   So in this, you can actually overlook certain offenses.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   She was actually complaining too much.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   And I could get on it.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I could say, "You memorized this in Cs!
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Don't complain!
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   You memorized this!
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   You know it by heart now!"
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   I could have said that.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   But that would have been a lot in my head.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   I could have left out what I could have said.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   "Annie, it's going to be okay.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   I could have walked her through that.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   I could have done a lot of things."
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   But in my frustration, "She's been doing this all day.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   She's crazy.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I have a crazy child.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   I'm thinking this in my mind.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   What's the matter with her?"
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And then I attacked her.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   A three-year-old kid.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   I'm 32.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   A three-year-old kid.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Now, as we think about this, we have to actively,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   in places of conflict, be able to analyze our heart
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   to be able to see the wrongs.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Here's a second one.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   The second one is actual sinful words or actions.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   I don't think that one needs too much stuff.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   So, the temptation in a conflict is constantly to look at
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   and blame the other person.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   But what you want to do there is to stop.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Just stop looking at them.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Stop blaming them.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Stop caring about what they're saying,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   about what they're doing.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   And you've got to be able to look at your own life.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Right at their choice.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   It doesn't matter how wrong they look.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   You are wrong.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   You are in sin.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   That's what we need to practice.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   If there's anger there, if there's frustration there,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   we like to use frustration to get out,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   to wiggle our way of saying angry.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Frustration is anger.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   We're working.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   We say, "I'm just frustrated."
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   No, no, we're angry.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   And so in that, we can think about the bitterness
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   that's welling up in our hearts.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   We can think about the resentment.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Are you clamming up in a situation like that?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Are you seething inside with words that you want to say?
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And so we need to go beyond the confession
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   of the wrong behavior and face up to the root cause.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   We've got to dig into our hearts.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   If you want to find the lodge,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   you have to be able to see deep, deep down
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   into what's causing it.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Like in that situation with my daughter,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   I could have been like, "I've got to stop being angry.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   I've got to stop yelling."
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   But if you do that, it's not going to help you.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Because you're going to just stop trying to use words
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   and you're going to go, "Willpower?
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Stop crying."
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   You do that, and she keeps going on a certain point,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   "Daddy, stop crying.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Daddy, stop crying!"
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   It's going to be like that.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   But what you want to do is dig down inside
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   and ask yourself, "Why is this causing me anger?"
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   And that's the law of your searching.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   And I can't take you through that today.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Maybe one day.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   All right, so conflict, by the way,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   can be fueled by normally good desires.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Maybe a good desire can be something like
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   craving to be understood, craving to be loved,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   or respected, or vindicated.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   These are okay, but you've elevated to a sinful demand
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   and selfishness.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   All right, and to the next slide.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   So look at this overlooking offense part.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Let's drop down the four questions.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   We've got to see what this...
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Here are some four questions that you can ask
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   if you can overlook this offense
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   or if we need to kind of proceed.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   So is the offense seriously dishonoring God?
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   Has it permanently damaged the relationship?
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Is it seriously hurting other people?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Is it seriously hurting the offender himself or herself?
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   So if you look at this, if it's no, no, no, no, no,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   you can consider maybe this is something that you can overlook.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   So now this isn't a passive process.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   You might think this is where you stay...
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   This isn't a time where you stay silent for a moment,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   like I'm going to overlook it this time.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   If you do it again, I'm going to get you.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Okay, that's not what this is.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   This is an active process.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   You're deliberately deciding not to dwell on it.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   This is decisive.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   And you're motivated by the character of God.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   And...
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Okay, can you go back to the slide?
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Okay, so this is...
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   These principles that come from who God is.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Good sense makes one slow to anger,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   and it is His glory to overlook offense.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Proverbs 17, 14 says,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   "The beginning of strife is like letting on water,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   so quit before the quarrel breaks out."
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   All right, let's go down to the back two steps--
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   or forward two steps.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Oh, boy, I don't know if we're going to do this.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Okay, that's Scripture section,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   youth transformation.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Now, I had a full exercise
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   we were going to do through Philippians 4, 2-9.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   I'm not going to get to that.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   But if you were to read through this,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   you can see in a conflict how,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   if you were to daily be in Scripture
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   and be saturated through it,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   that it would start to change your heart
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   and transform your heart.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Okay, you could do that on your own.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   All right, next slide.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   What about my rights?
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Your rights don't matter.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Okay?
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   All right, so Paul talks about rights in 1 Corinthians,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   dropped down to the next paragraph.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   He talks about legal rights, marital rights,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   dietary rights, rights of the apostles.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   And then he says, "At the end of all of that,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   do all to the glory of God.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   or to the Church of God,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   just as I try to please everyone in everything I do,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   not seeking my own advantage,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   but that of many that they may be saved.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Be in it."
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   And I love this.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   We like to break it off here,
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   but this is connected.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   "Be in it, here is a need, that I am of Christ."
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   He's saying this is the type of Christ that we serve.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   It is a person who has thought of the other
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   before himself.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   And so, if we think about our rights,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   we do not need to hold on to this.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   We do not need to cling to it.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Where would we be if Jesus held on to his rights?
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   We would be in hell.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   And that is not something that we want--
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   we're a place we want to be.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   And so for us, if we can claim that,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   how can we ever say, "My rights are so important,"
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   to keep other people from something like that?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   [audience murmurs]
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Let's just finish off with this.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   I'm going to stop.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   All right.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Next slide.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   So Romans 12 talks about,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   "If possible, so far as it depends on you,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   live peacefully with all."
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   And the highlight here is vengeance is mine.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   I will face the Lord.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   And that means you do not need to hold on to your rights
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   because God will be the avenger.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Okay?
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Okay, next slide.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Getting the law out of your eye,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   it addresses actually a core root of idolatry.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   And so this is what you want to get out.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Here are the four things that are--
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   let's go to the next one.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   And the next one--sorry, guys.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   You're dropped on all four.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   You're going to have a desire in your heart.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   "I desire my roommate to do--"
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   "I desire my roommate to do his dishes."
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   And then I demand that I go to him.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   I demand it in certain ways.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   I've been patient six times.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   I've done his dishes six times.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Now I demand, "Hey, do your dishes."
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   And the third one, I judge.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   You're judging him.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   And then fourthly, what happens in your heart then is I punish.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   So go to the next.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   I punish him.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Okay.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Next slide.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   And go to the seven A's of confession.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   And go through this one.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   I am so sorry, guys.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   I didn't think it would take this long.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   Okay.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   And the quotes are all there.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   So these are ways you need to confess
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   before you're able to go and address another person.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   So the seven are address everyone involved,
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   avoid if, but, and maybe you know that well, right?
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   You say, "I'm sorry, but if you didn't say that,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   I wouldn't have thought this way.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   I wouldn't have done that."
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   We all know that we do need some of that.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Married couples, yes?
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Okay, number three, admit specifically.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Don't say, "I'm sorry for making you feel bad about it."
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Say, "I'm sorry for," and go deep down into specifics
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   of what you did wrong and how you offended them
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   and how you might have offended God.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Fourthly, acknowledge the hurt.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   It doesn't matter where you are.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   When you're confessing to someone,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   you want to acknowledge what you did.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Fifthly, you accept the consequences.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Sixthly, alter behavior.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   So make sure that you're changing as you come,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   you're confessing, or else it's not a real confession.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   And the seventh, we ask for forgiveness.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   This is all before you're able to go and address
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   what's going on in their lives.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Okay?
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   -Bye.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   -Bye.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   -Come back.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   -Okay.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   On your sheet, I gave you guys a list of possible laws.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   You guys can kind of take a look at that.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   It starts with reckless words,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   and it ends in good things you want too much.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   So check yourself and look,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   and then I don't know, one day maybe we could do the final two.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   I will end this prayer, and then we'll go to the next one.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Let's pray.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   that you reconciled with us
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   that we might be reconcilers in this world.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   And by the pursuit of peace,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   we pray that we can then say,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   "We're doing this because you are a God of peace
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   who has offered salvation, grace, mercy,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   and compassion unto us."
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   And so we extend the same to others.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   God, help us never to receive this grace
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   and withhold it from others.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   May we be dispensers of peace,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   dispensers of grace,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   that you might be glorified in our lives.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.780]   Okay, I'm sick.
