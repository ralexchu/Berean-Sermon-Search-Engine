[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400]   - Hi everyone, my name is Diane Lee and I'm a first year student at UC Irvine.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.300]   Growing up in a Korean Presbyterian church for the majority of my life, I was always
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.840]   surrounded by God's word and the church.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.680]   I collected biblical head knowledge, which was something I prided myself of as a young
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.680]   child.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.800]   However, I was not able to accept these biblical truths in my heart.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.520]   Although I never doubted God's existence or Christ's sacrifice that was mercifully gifted
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.280]   to us, it never became a personal testament to my faith until much later in my life.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.400]   At the age of 12, during a junior high summer retreat, I experienced what I thought was
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.400]   true salvation.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.000]   It was the first time my biblical head knowledge pierced my heart and allowed me to see what
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.720]   it truly means to follow Jesus and live for his kingdom.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.720]   However, my emotion driven spiritual high died down as soon as we drove off from the
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.120]   retreat site.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.000]   This pattern continued for the rest of my years in junior high and high school.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.720]   I saw my spiritual life in waves that would rise during and after a spiritual revival
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.000]   and later die down during the stagnant periods of my life.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I was afraid to let go of my sinful desires because I was self driven and prideful in
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   my worldly accomplishments.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.240]   I had no desire to turn away from sin.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.760]   In fact, I wanted to reap the benefits of salvation without dying to my worldly desires.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.060]   Despite my lack of true salvation, I was under the impression that I was truly saved because
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.440]   of this, I made the choice to get baptized in ninth grade through the sprinkling of water,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.520]   motivated by my selfish desire to join an exclusive club of young baptized believers.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.360]   Even in my sprinkling baptism, I was driven by external motives and I lacked a true heart
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   of repentance.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.920]   During my senior year of high school, in the midst of the pandemic, I fell into a period
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   of depression that stemmed from the contentment I felt sitting in my sin.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.760]   At this point in my life, I pushed God away and placed my trust on the world rather than
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.360]   God's promises.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.920]   I was a slave to sin, feeding into my own desires while still considering myself a believer
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.400]   because I believe the events of the Bible to be true.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.280]   I try to fill the emptiness I felt with sinful pleasures and although only God can bring
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.040]   true joy and fulfillment in my life, I had no real desire to turn to God nor put my trust
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.620]   in him.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.640]   After all the time I spent constantly relying on the world, my older brother urged me to
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.520]   read the book of Ecclesiastes as a reminder that the pleasures I find in the world are
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.400]   fleeting and temporary, but God's promises are forever.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.480]   Ecclesiastes 2, 11 says, "Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.000]   and the labor which I had exerted and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.400]   there was no profit under the sun."
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.120]   Through the book of Ecclesiastes, God convicted my heart and reminded me that my depression
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.480]   stemmed from my desire to worship myself through what the world had to offer.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.160]   For the first time in my life, I understood the weight of God's promises and how they
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.240]   are so much greater than the futile pleasures I had been pursuing for my entire life.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.280]   Coming into college, God continued to reveal his glory to me and ultimately led me to a
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.160]   church that would grow my faith and give me a solid foundation of the word.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.600]   I came to Berean by mere chance when a mutual on Instagram recommended me to come to Berean's
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.520]   college welcome event.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.120]   God led me to Berean in the strangest way and continued to get me plugged into the church
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   by his grace.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.920]   Towards the beginning of my first winter quarter, I felt a deep need to examine my heart and
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.760]   where I stand before God.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.080]   I realized how much of my life had been displeasing to God and how much I went to church for my
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.240]   own self-justification.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.960]   Although my head knowledge of the Bible led me to think that I had salvation, I couldn't
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.800]   let go of my worldly desires and try to love both God and the world thinking that I can
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.120]   enjoy the pleasures of both, although God's promises truly outweigh the world's.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.260]   I became a true believer at this time when I truly died to my worldly desires and offered
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.720]   up my whole life, not just part of it, to Christ.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.000]   By his grace, God planted this conviction in me after 19 years of being a superficial
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.320]   churchgoer.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.160]   The spirit has allowed me to see the weight of my sin and how it isn't possible to love
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.200]   both my sin and God.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.360]   As a sinner, through the resurrection of Christ on the cross and the atonement for sin, I
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.400]   am truly able to come before God as his child.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.680]   Ultimately, as a true believer, I now live not to fulfill my own desires, but I live
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.440]   to glorify God in all that I do, for his promises are eternal and much greater than anything
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   that this world could possibly offer.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   Thank you.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   [applause]
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440]   [pause]
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   >> And you understand when you go into the water, you're in the United States, right?
