[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   The reason why I say that is because we're going to look at a very familiar story in
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.160]   the book of Exodus chapter 3.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.600]   So please turn your Bibles there.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.800]   And while we're going there, you are familiar with the story, nation of Israel oppressed
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.880]   by the Egyptians.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.560]   God calls Moses and God has a plan of deliverance.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.080]   And in so having this plan radically changes Moses' route in life, radically changes what
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.560]   Moses is doing.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.280]   So let's go there.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   So we're going to, sorry give me a second here.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.800]   Exodus chapter 3, I'm going to start reading from verse 7.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.000]   It says, "Then the Lord said, 'I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600]   Egypt and I've heard their cry because of their taskmasters.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.240]   I know their sufferings and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.840]   and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.800]   and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.000]   the Hittites and Jebusites.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920]   And now behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to Me and I have also seen the oppression
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280]   with which the Egyptians oppressed them.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.520]   Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.520]   out of Egypt.'
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.200]   But Moses said to God, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.440]   out of Egypt?'
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   He said, 'But I will be with you and this shall be the sign for you that I have sent
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   you.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.240]   When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.'"
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.480]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.160]   Our Heavenly Father, we want to thank You so much for Your Word.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.240]   It is truly Your light unto our path and God is Your wisdom to us.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960]   I pray, Father Lord, that every single one of us would continue to be exposed to Your
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.600]   Word and God, that our hearts and our minds would be transformed by it.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.440]   We want to pray, Lord, for the work of Your ministry.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.640]   God, as You lay out for us the story of Moses, I do pray that You grant to us a vision of
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.680]   Your plan, a vision of what You are doing and God, that we would fully embrace it.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.680]   Lord Father, we thank You.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   Amen.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   Okay.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.000]   So, as we take a look at this passage, again, a very familiar passage that many of you have
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.320]   heard and have read before, I want to highlight essentially three truths about God's plan.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.240]   And the three truths that I'm going to highlight, they are obvious.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.360]   So if my title headings are like really boring, I apologize.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.960]   They're just obvious truths, but need to highlight them because sometimes, although obvious,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.240]   very difficult to apply, very difficult to accept.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.400]   Well, as we take a look at the story, first, if I draw your attention to verse 7 through
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.760]   9, you see the situation by which God comes to.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.520]   The Lord says, "I surely have seen affliction of My people who are in Egypt, heard their
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.840]   cry of their taskmasters, and I know their suffering."
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   Okay?
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.560]   So, He describes their plight, their problem and dilemma in a kind of variety of ways,
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.280]   their affliction and suffering and their cry.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.840]   And we know that the oppression of the Jewish people throughout their history has been intense,
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.200]   to say the least, right?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.480]   Well, here specifically, they have been enslaved.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.520]   They have been beaten down.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.560]   And when we read this, you know, previously, if you remember the story of Moses, there
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.120]   was a generation when the Pharaoh actually murdered all the male babies.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.400]   Just think about the kind of suffering a people would go through when their children are murdered,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   right?
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.080]   The generation of children are murdered.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.400]   So their suffering is not only long, because for 400 years they've been in Egypt, it's
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.840]   intense and it is impossible for them to get out of.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.520]   Let's make this clear.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.000]   The people needed deliverance from the outside.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.980]   This is not one of these like good Disney movies where it's like, "Believe in yourself.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.400]   Let's gather together."
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   You've got these farmers or these slave people, you know, learning and training and it's like,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.440]   "Let's gather together and overpower the Egyptians."
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.600]   Like that is not possible.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.040]   Again, generation of males were killed.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   Think what that would do.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.240]   So if I said, you know, "These slaves were weak," I mean, that would be an understatement,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   right?
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.480]   They were intensely, intensely in need and so they absolutely needed deliverance.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.840]   And I'm just trying to repeat this idea, impossible for them to do on their own, okay?
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.160]   Impossible for them to do on their own.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.840]   So with that said, we go to the first truth about God's plan of deliverance.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.200]   Ba-dum.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.400]   There's Moses.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.200]   First truth of God's plan of deliverance, that in God's plan of deliverance, God uses
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.600]   His people to do the impossible, okay?
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.840]   I want you to think about this for a moment as we read.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.640]   I just try to make it very clear this is an impossible task for the people.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.600]   And so when you take a look at this, look at verse 10.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.440]   "Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.320]   out of Egypt."
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.920]   Think about how Moses would have received that.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.760]   When Moses hears this message from God and God saying, "I have come down," he's thinking,
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.760]   "Yes, great.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.200]   That's amazing.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.720]   I will send you."
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.040]   It's like, "Wait, what?
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   No."
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.560]   It was impossible for an entire people.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.720]   How would it be possible for one?
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.760]   Impossible for many Hebrews.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.040]   How is it possible for one Hebrew?
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.480]   It is impossible.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   But let's observe this, again, clear and obvious truth that's been ruled throughout history.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:25.960]   God has so chosen that upon endeavoring on this impossible task, He regularly uses His
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.100]   people to accomplish it.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.320]   And that's found all over the place.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:37.200]   For example, if we look at Matthew chapter 5, starting from verse 14 through 16, okay,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.480]   Matthew chapter 5, verse 14 through 16, we know that the generation is wicked, depraved,
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   and dark.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.360]   We're in the kingdom of darkness, right?
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.620]   What does He say to all that?
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.920]   Jesus says, "You are the light.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.640]   A town built on a hill cannot be hidden, neither do people light a lamp and put it under a
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.640]   bowl.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.800]   Instead, they put it on a stand and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.200]   In the same way, you let your light shine before others that they may see your good
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.440]   deeds and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:16.960]   Christ's design, you know, God's plan, His program, how we should perceive the situation
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.160]   right now is we are to be the light.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.480]   In this decaying, dark generation, you're supposed to be the light.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.920]   Here's another passage, Acts chapter 1, verse 7 through 8.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.760]   The disciples are asking this question like, "Where's going to be the kingdom?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.240]   How is the kingdom going to come?
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240]   Is it going to be now?
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.960]   Are you going to do it?"
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.080]   And Jesus says, or here, He says, "So when they had come together, they were asking Him,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.400]   saying, 'Lord, is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom of Israel?'
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   And He said to them, 'It is not for you to know the times or epochs which the Father
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.640]   has fixed by His own authority, but," look at this, "but you will receive power when
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.400]   the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, in all
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.560]   Judea, Samaria, even to the remotest part of the earth."
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:13.480]   It has been a regular pattern that in God's plan of redemption overall, He uses His people.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.160]   That's an obvious, this is not like groundbreaking new stuff that you've never, ever heard before.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.360]   This is stuff you've heard many times.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   So why am I saying this?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.560]   It's because there is a problem.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:33.120]   The problem is, although this is God's landscape for us now and then, many times we say, "Oh,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.960]   not for me."
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.660]   We have multiple excuses.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.520]   We have times when we just don't think that's God's will for us.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.440]   I don't know what it may be, but we sound a lot like Moses.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.680]   Take a look at chapter 4, Exodus chapter 4, when Moses is speaking with the Lord.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.720]   You know that there's a series of questions Moses asks the Lord.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   "Me?
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   Who am I?
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.760]   What am I going to say about you?
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.480]   And what am I going to do with da-da-da-da-da?"
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.480]   And then eventually Moses starts to disagree with God, and this is what he says.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.760]   In chapter 4, let's see, passage verse 10 through 13, okay, 10 through 13, "Moses said
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.600]   to the Lord, 'Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since You have spoken
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.040]   to Your servant, but I am slow of speech and tongue.'
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.080]   Then the Lord said to him, 'Who made man's mouth?
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.760]   Who makes him mute or deaf or seeing or blind?
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.480]   Is it not I, the Lord?
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.760]   Now therefore, go, and I will be with your mouth, teach you what you shall speak.'
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:39.640]   But he said, 'Oh, Lord, my Lord, please send somebody else.'"
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.400]   We have plenty of excuses.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.640]   I mean, even in the, "I am not eloquent," and "I can't," I mean, you're pretty eloquent
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.160]   when you're giving your excuses, you know, pretty much.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.920]   And I just want to say, I mean, for me too, there's so many excuses for not doing what
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   the Lord has said.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.800]   Well, you know, one of the things that I experienced out in China this year at this trip was, man,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.520]   I was silenced by just seeing who was there.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.480]   We got to China just about three, four days early before the camp started, and we had
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.160]   training and we had a chance to go to the wall and stuff.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.840]   And while we were doing the training, we met other, like, missionaries and workers who
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.680]   were there, other teachers.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.360]   There was a 72-year-old man.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.720]   He's just like a water sanitation worker guy working for the government in Seattle, and
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.000]   he tells me his story.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I've been here 14 years.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.160]   What he does is he takes two weeks of his pay time off, and then he asks his boss, "Can
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.840]   I take two more weeks without pay off so I can go to China?"
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.480]   His boss said, "Yes."
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   So he flies every year.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   72.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.960]   By the end of the trip, he was kind of wheezing and stuff, and I was like, "Oh, are you okay?"
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.520]   But he's up with us.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.240]   He goes to dorms with us, visits at night after dinner's over.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.600]   He does the whole thing.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.280]   We also had two little girls.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.280]   They weren't little, actually.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.940]   They were taller than me.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.160]   But there were 16 and 17, youth group students.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   "Where are you from?"
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   "The Netherlands."
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   "What?
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.160]   I don't even know what the Netherlands—like, are you Dutch, Holland?
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   What do I call you?"
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.600]   You know, but they were there, and we were engaging, and they told me that, yeah, one
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.240]   of them got saved, like, you know, at a youth camp.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.760]   They gave their life to the Lord.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.000]   It's their second year out there.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.480]   They're serving the Lord.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.960]   The family that is orchestrating this whole thing—they were the facilitators, kind of
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.240]   the program directors of this camp—like, amazing people.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   His name is Wouter.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.560]   It's spelled W-O-U-T-E-R, Wouter.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.720]   Amazing man.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.360]   Super humble, super, like, like-minded, godly.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   He's got his wife.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.280]   They've been out there eight years serving.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.960]   Four kids—five, three, one and a half, and one six weeks old.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.320]   They were at the camp the whole time.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.360]   I was like, "Dude, nothing's stopping you guys."
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.640]   So I had, like, there were moments—I had a lot of mosquito bites, and some days I was
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.280]   just drowsy, and I was just, you know, the itch in me to complain, like, "Oh, no, no,
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   no, I'm so tired.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.520]   Oh, no, no, no, itchy mosquitoes, and na, na, na, na, na, na, na," right?
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.240]   I look at them and just can't.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.240]   People around you, you just can't say anything, because if you do, you're just going to look
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   dumb.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.440]   I've been through that, and that just inspired me.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.280]   Now, I say that not to be like, like, "Every one of you, get out there!"
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.080]   Like, no, I don't believe that it's for every single one of us to be missionaries, because
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.160]   we're not.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:27.240]   Not every single one of us is called to go out to the mission field, you know, et cetera,
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.480]   et cetera.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:35.800]   However, certain callings are absolutely clear, and we are without excuse.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.720]   And although it is obvious, many times we push it afar, like, "That's nice.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   I'm so encouraged by that.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   Good for you."
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.000]   But we don't think it's for me.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.320]   But I know every single one of us, no matter what stage of life you're in, God has called
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.500]   you to shed light in your environment.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.400]   God has not called you to be silent.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.680]   God has called you to be vocal about His grace, about His glory, and all that He has done
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.760]   for you, to speak in thanksgiving, to sing songs.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.880]   God I know, God has called every single one of you, even if you don't have to go all the
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:15.400]   way out to China or some remote part of the world, God has clearly called you, amen?
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.720]   And we have to not just like, "That's nice."
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   We have to buy that in.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.920]   Like, we have to accept that and say, "That's for me."
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.520]   And so, there is a progression of thought there.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.360]   Have you guys ever prayed something like this?
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.920]   "Lord, if it be Your will, use me to minister to my coworkers."
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.520]   Progress from there.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520]   Progress from there.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.960]   What do I mean by that?
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.400]   Let me give you an example, okay?
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.880]   There's a bad way to apologize to somebody, especially you men, I'm giving you a tip of
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.400]   advice.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:59.880]   If your girlfriend, wife is upset, do not say, "You know, if I hurt you in any way,
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.520]   if you're mad, right, I'm sorry."
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.120]   Because what does that sound like?
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.640]   "Well, if you're going to make a big deal about it, then here."
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.480]   You know, that's what it sounds like.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.080]   Because you can't say, "If."
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.960]   You should know if they're mad.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.320]   You should know if you did something stupid.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.480]   You should know.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.280]   What I'm saying there is likewise.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.480]   If you come to the Lord like, "If this happens to be Your will."
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.160]   No, God has said.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.840]   It is absolutely crystal clear.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.120]   God uses His people for His glory and His work and His kingdom and His ministry.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.920]   So it's not for you to say, "If it be Your will."
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.840]   It's for you to say, "I know this is Your will."
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.800]   Now again, the practical applications of that, whether you should go out on the mission field,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.160]   whether you should take initiative to do a certain kind of ministry, that's yes, for
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.560]   you to work out with fear and trembling, for you to pray and take the lead of God.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.360]   But when it comes to the overall ministry of God, for you to evangelize and be a light,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.440]   no, that is God's program for you now.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.120]   And let us not be wishy and washy about that.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.080]   Here's an interesting passage I would like you to go to, John chapter 17, verse 14 through
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.720]   20.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.360]   John chapter 17, verse 14 through 20.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.720]   Jesus is praying before He goes to the cross.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.420]   This is famously known as Jesus' high priestly prayer.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.000]   And in that moment, Jesus prays for His disciples in this fashion, okay?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.480]   John chapter 17, verse 14 through 20.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.880]   Jesus says, "I have given them Your word and the world has hated them because they
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.480]   are not of the world."
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.520]   I want you to think about that, okay?
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.320]   Current landscape, your ministry, is it always going to be successful?
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.600]   Jesus told you already what it's going to be like.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.920]   "Just as I am not of the world, I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.960]   you keep them from the evil one.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.800]   They are not of the world, just as I'm not of the world, but sanctify them in Your truth.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.680]   Your word is truth, as you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.600]   And for their sake, I consecrate myself that they also may be sanctified in truth.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.320]   I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.760]   word."
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.320]   So what is God's design?
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.600]   I'm just talking about like current circumstance.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:35.640]   You should have a worldview of how you fit your role in God's program.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:41.000]   God uses His people to accomplish the impossible.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.920]   That's what God does.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:50.720]   So for us, I don't want to hear stuff like, "I don't want to do this because I..."
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   Why am I using that voice?
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.720]   I don't know.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   Sorry, I'm just going to use it.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:00.840]   "I don't want to do this because God has only called me to be sender, never speaker.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.680]   I don't want to do this because I know it's not going to work.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   I don't want to do this because..."
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.160]   We have so many excuses.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.960]   This is God's program for us now.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.240]   Now moving forward to the next part.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.560]   Point number two, let's look at...
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.560]   Oops, sorry.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   Point number two, God's plan is gold.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.920]   God's plan of deliverance is absolute gold.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.920]   Okay?
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.680]   What do I mean by that?
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:33.640]   Well, when you look at Moses' words after the Lord, God, speaks to him and tells him,
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.360]   "This is why I've come.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.080]   I'm going to deliver the people."
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.140]   And he says, "So therefore, I'm going to send you."
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.480]   Take a look at verse 11 and on.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:49.920]   Moses says to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.480]   out of Egypt?"
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480]   Okay?
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.480]   "Who am I?"
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.480]   Right?
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:02.000]   Now, Moses receives a lot of criticism for that question and partially rightly so.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.520]   When God says, "Go," it's not for you to all of a sudden be like, "Not me.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.520]   I can't do it.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   Oh."
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:15.120]   You know, like to throw a pity party for yourself because that's not trusting in God's plan.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.280]   God's plan is gold.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.040]   You should have confidence in God's plan, but you saying, "Who am I?"
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.960]   That just means you're way too much thinking about yourself, right?
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.280]   So rightly so, Moses receives a ton of criticism.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   You hear every commentary.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.040]   He receives a ton of criticism for saying, "Who am I?"
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.440]   However, I was thinking about it and every single one of us would say the exact same
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.760]   thing if we were him.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   Why?
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.280]   Because the story goes, Moses at this time is not a young man saying, "Yeah, let's do
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.840]   it," you know?
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.320]   He's 80.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.360]   So when you see the photos where he's all gray, that's accurate.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.120]   Scripture says that he spent 40 years in Egypt, 40 years in the wilderness of the Midianites.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.920]   He was just a shepherd.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.160]   So here's a weathered man with lots of sorrow in his life.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160]   He calls himself the sojourner.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.840]   You know, he's like, "I don't belong anywhere."
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.080]   And he names his son a sojourner and all this kind of stuff.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.080]   He's a sad man.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   He's not motivated.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.040]   He's like, "Yeah, I'm going to lead these people."
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.840]   Not only that, he can't lead these people.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   Why?
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.160]   Because he lived his life in Egypt as an Egyptian.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.220]   He was in the palace.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.200]   So imagine he coming to the Hebrews and saying, "I'm going to lead you guys."
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.960]   The Hebrews aren't thinking, "Yes!
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.520]   You know, you were always faithful."
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.960]   No, they're thinking, "Are you kidding?
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.360]   You're an Egyptian.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.880]   You're like an Egyptian dropout."
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.200]   What's more, the Egyptians don't like him because remember, when he left Egypt, he killed
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   the man.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   He killed an Egyptian soldier.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.960]   So it says that Pharaoh was after his life.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.360]   They wanted to kill him.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.000]   So he's hated by the Egyptians, hated by the Hebrews.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.640]   He's old.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.440]   He's not thinking, "Yeah, I can do it."
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.240]   He's thinking, "Are you serious?
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.320]   Who am I?"
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.520]   We would say the exact same thing.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:09.000]   He's failed prince, murderer, dropout, so to speak.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   That being the case, there is a reality.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.900]   Every time we're doing a work of God, like a ministry of the Lord, we're going to get
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:21.920]   a quick, like a really quick rush of looking at our resume and realizing, "I am not qualified
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.920]   for this task.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.280]   I am not qualified for this position."
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.760]   Now, if we stop there, that's sad, right?
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.360]   It's like give up, throw your hands up and like, "Yeah, this is impossible."
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.680]   But God expects us, knowing we're not qualified, to still have confidence.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.360]   Did you know that?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.620]   So first part of God's plan, in God's plan of deliverance, He uses people to do the impossible.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.940]   In that circumstance, you're going to feel like, "I'm not qualified," but He expects
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.060]   you to have confidence.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.060]   Huh?
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:59.260]   How in the world do you have confidence when the task is impossible and you don't feel
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.260]   qualified?
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.140]   Well, the answer comes in.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.720]   You have to have confidence in God's golden plan.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   Take a look at this, verse 12.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.140]   This is amazing to me, okay?
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:17.080]   Verse 12, "God says to Moses, 'But I will be with you, and this shall be a sign for
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.080]   you.'"
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.660]   Is this where He does the miracles of the snake and the hand and the bosom and it comes
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.660]   out like snow?
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.660]   No, this is what He says.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.700]   "This will be a sign for you, that I have sent you.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:34.800]   When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.040]   That's weird to me.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   Is that weird to you?
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.800]   Moses is sitting here saying, "Who am I?
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   I can't do this."
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.520]   And God says, "I'm going to give you a sign that you can."
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.400]   And God doesn't say, "I raised you up in Egypt.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.360]   I was there, you know?
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.960]   I trained you.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.120]   You're trained in military arts of the Egyptians.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.760]   You're trained as a prince for this purpose.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.440]   You are ready, my son."
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.480]   You know, like that would be a great movie, you know?
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.840]   Like believe in yourself.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   You can do it.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.760]   And that would be an awesome movie.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.440]   But that's not what God says at all.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:16.760]   God says, "The proof that you are sent by me is after the fact.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.480]   When this plan is accomplished and you're going to stand on this mountain and worship."
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.840]   He's not even giving a sign.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.840]   The sign is going to be then before the act.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.400]   The sign is after.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:36.280]   After God's golden plan works to the T, Moses is then going to know, "My goodness."
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.920]   What is he saying?
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.480]   For us, we have to have absolute confidence in the power of God, the power of His plan,
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.320]   the power of His Word.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.240]   There is where our confidence lies.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.280]   So shaky people, all of you who are nervous, all of you who are fearful, because to tell
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.240]   you honestly, here is the problem.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.380]   That many of us, the reason why we don't evangelize as we ought, we don't speak up, is because
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.380]   we're what?
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.380]   We're afraid.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.000]   We're afraid it's not going to work.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.240]   We're afraid it's not going to bear the kind of result we want to have.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.400]   Why am I so afraid of talking to my boss?
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.200]   Like when I was working in the secular field, not Pastor Peter or the elders, like why am
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.760]   I so afraid of talking to like, you know, in your workplace environment, your managers
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.600]   and your coworkers, because you're afraid exactly of what's going to happen when all
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600]   this goes sour.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.440]   It's going to be mega awkward.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.560]   It's not going to work.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.360]   They're going to reject me, and we're just afraid.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.520]   The fact of the matter is when we do that, we've lost confidence in God's golden plan.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.440]   Part of the reason why even those of you who are shaky in your voice, even those of you
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.880]   who are timid and all introverted, why you can still go and evangelize is because you
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.720]   can bank all of your confidence and boast on Christ and His power.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:59.600]   You believe the gospel to be powerful, so powerful it'll transform and save people,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   amen?
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.060]   So you bank on that and you go.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.520]   You bank on that and you speak.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.880]   Christians, Christians have this weird, weird balance.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.760]   Absolute no confidence in the flesh or my own ability.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760]   We know we're incapable.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:22.520]   We know our resume is horrendous, but we have absolute boldness because of Christ.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.000]   That should be our regular scenario.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.800]   I want to point you to a passage, 2 Peter chapter 3.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.240]   Okay, 2 Peter chapter 3.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.680]   Go over to 2 Peter chapter 3, verse 1.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:43.920]   It's a little bit lengthy passage, but in line with our theme of thinking about God's
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:51.120]   plan of deliverance, how you fit into that role, but also how much confidence we can
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.520]   have on God's Word, how much confidence we can have on God's plan, this passage fits
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.480]   perfectly.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.240]   He says this, starting from verse 1, it's a little bit of a lengthy passage, please
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.040]   follow along.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.680]   This is now the second letter that I am writing to you, beloved, in both of them, I am stirring
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.400]   up your sincere mind by way of reminder that you should remember the predictions of the
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.280]   holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles, knowing
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.080]   first of all, listen to this, the scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing,
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.000]   following their own sinful desires.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.600]   They will say, "Where is the promise of His coming?
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.880]   For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   beginning of creation."
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.720]   For they deliberately overlooked this fact that the heavens existed long ago and the
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.800]   earth was formed out of water and through water by the Word of God and that by means
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:51.000]   of these, the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.120]   But by the same Word of the heavens and earth that now exists are stored up for fire being
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.000]   kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.160]   But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is a thousand years
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.200]   and a thousand years is one day.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.480]   The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise as some count slowness, but is patient towards
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.200]   you not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.880]   The day of the Lord will come like a thief and then the heavens will pass away with a
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.920]   roar and the heavenly bodies will be burnt up and dissolve and the earth and the works
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.160]   that are done on it will be exposed.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.400]   Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you be in lives
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.840]   of holiness and godliness?
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.440]   Why do I say that passage fits perfectly?
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:45.800]   Because the scoffers all around you, the people of unbelief are going to tell you God's plan
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.520]   failed.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.040]   God is not coming, Christ is not returning, look how long it's been.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.360]   I bet you the time of Moses, 400 years, you know people are probably saying God's plan
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   failed.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.520]   God's forgotten us, He has rejected us, He has nowhere to be found.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.160]   But God's plan is golden.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:12.800]   To the degree, Apostle Peter says, just like God through the power of His Word already
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.240]   judged the world with water, God will judge the world with fire.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.800]   And you know this for certain, do not, do not forget this fact, God's Word will stand
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   true.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.880]   That's the same thing for us, that's the same challenge.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.240]   God's plan will work, not the way that we think, not what the kind of results that you
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:39.000]   want to see, but according to His way and His design, God's plan will work and you can
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.880]   bank on that.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:47.840]   So with that kind of encouragement, we have confidence to be witnesses for the Lord.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:28:00.440]   Next and the final point, God's plan was, is, and will always be for His glory.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:07.240]   God's plan was, is, will always be for His glory.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   What do I mean by that?
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.040]   Well, let's head back to Exodus chapter 3 and start looking from verse 13.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:21.640]   Okay, Exodus chapter 3, starting from verse 13.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:27.720]   So after God encourages Moses' heart, God says this, starting from verse 13 down to
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:33.360]   verse 17, "Then Moses said to God, 'If I come to the people of Israel and say to them,
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.560]   'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   what shall I say to them?
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.840]   God said to Moses, 'I am who I am,' and he says, 'Say this to the people of Israel,
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.760]   'I am has sent me to you.'
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.720]   God also said to Moses, 'Say this to the people of Israel, 'The Lord, the God of your
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.360]   fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob has sent me to you.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:04.680]   This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.'"
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:12.120]   God's plan was, is, and will always be for His glory.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   God is saying, "Moses, earlier you asked, 'Who am I?'
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.320]   And I'm showing you it's not really about you.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.780]   My plan is golden.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.560]   Have confidence in my plan."
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.760]   And now He's directing the attention, Moses essentially asks, "Who do I say you are?"
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.440]   And God says, "I am that I am."
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.320]   I wish we could spend a whole lot of time there because you know that the name that
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:40.080]   God has revealed is so packed with rich theology, that He is eternal, He's self-sufficient,
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.840]   that He is.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.640]   But as we're talking about truths of God's plan, likewise, then God's plan serves His
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.200]   nature.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:57.680]   He is the glorious One who has been working long before Moses ever entered on the scene.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.360]   He is working now, and He is going to work out His plan into the future, and all of that,
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:08.240]   the whole entirety of His plan is absolutely going to be for His glory.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.000]   But here's the problem.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:20.080]   Many of us, by subtle and maybe unintending ways, sometimes diminish or try to diminish
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.280]   His glory.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   How do we do that?
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.080]   By trying to play chess.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.400]   Do you guys remember this?
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.720]   On your old computers playing chess?
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.400]   What do I mean Moses is trying to play chess?
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.120]   What do I mean that we try to play chess?
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.720]   Well the fact of the matter is, Moses, when he starts to ask these questions, he says
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:48.800]   he's starting to roll his brain and saying, "Well, okay, but if I go and I say, 'God
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.600]   sent me to you,' they're going to be like, 'What God?
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   God didn't speak to you?'"
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.640]   Remember, you're an Egyptian dropout, so he's like anticipating their move, and then
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.280]   he's anticipating His move, and then he's anticipating God's move, and then God's
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.240]   trying to tell him, "My plan is golden.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.200]   I have detailed every single part of this plan to the degree that God has said, 'This
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.320]   is how a Pharaoh is going to reject me.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.720]   This is how a Pharaoh is going to reject you, and this is what you're going to say, and
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   this is going to...'"
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.880]   God has detailed every single part of that plan, but Moses is still doing what?
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.720]   He's still doubting, and he's still trying to play chess.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.360]   How does that diminish glory?
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.600]   Let me give you an example, okay?
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:33.320]   We have said that God has, okay, I'm just saying now, okay, there is an impossible task
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.160]   at hand, the deliverance of God's people.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.040]   We are incapable, right?
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.120]   And the results, we are not sure.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.680]   Imagine if you're at work, some of you guys work for engineering firms, or maybe you guys
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.120]   work for accounting firms, you guys work for whoever it may be, your business, okay?
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.640]   Imagine that your senior CEO or president or whatever constantly assigns you tasks that
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:02.640]   are absolutely impossible, and then He assigns it to people who are incapable, and maybe
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.720]   you never feel like you're equipped, and you never feel like He's properly training you,
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.840]   and then the results are always botched.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.240]   How would you feel?
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.660]   You would feel all of a sudden an incredible amount of distrust for your boss.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.080]   Is this the way you make decisions?
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.180]   Is this how you're going to treat us?
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.880]   Is this what we're working for?
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   This is pointless.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880]   Da-da-da-da-da, right?
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.320]   See, that would all, and in everything, that would be appropriate, I guess, in the work
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.600]   environment, in a business environment where your objective is to produce, or your objective
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.680]   is to make money, your objective is to grow your business.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.120]   This is what I'm saying.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.040]   Our mentality is so skewed when all of a sudden we're like, "This is impossible.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   This isn't effective.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   Look at the results."
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:55.200]   Well, that's what Moses is thinking.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.960]   I know what the results are going to be.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:04.080]   This is not going to work, and in so saying that, he diminishes the glory of God.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   Why?
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:11.960]   Because God's plan, His plan of deliverance was, is, and will always be for God's glory.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:18.780]   God has said that whether the Egyptians know Him, repent, turn around, even you guys, whether
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:23.720]   you repent, turn around, whatever you do, regardless, what's going to happen?
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.000]   God will be honored.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.280]   Turn your Bibles to Exodus chapter 14, verse 17 through 18.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.640]   This is quite profound.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:38.720]   It changes our paradigm of how we're interpreting success and failure.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:44.240]   It changes our paradigm of how we're interpreting success and failure, because take a look at
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.120]   this.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.800]   Chapter 14, verse 17 through 18.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:55.680]   God says, "As for me, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.360]   go in after them, and I will be what?
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.560]   Honored through Pharaoh and all his army through his chariots and his horsemen.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.960]   Then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I am honored through Pharaoh, through
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.680]   his chariots and his horsemen."
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   So God is being honored even in the hardness of the Egyptians.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:18.120]   God is being honored even when the chariots are chasing the Hebrews to the sea.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.920]   Then how dare we all of a sudden be like, "This is not going to work.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.440]   Boo, I'm not doing this."
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.600]   That's dishonoring to God.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.920]   Why am I saying this?
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:32.520]   Because oftentimes we in our, I don't know what it is, but sometimes as soon as we think
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.080]   this is not going to work, we give up.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.200]   We live in a generation, we know that the people aren't going to listen to us.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.640]   I don't know if some pastors or missionary has come after a mission ship and they come
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.000]   over and they're like, "The harvest is white.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.680]   It's time for harvesting.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.760]   Let's go reap and all we need is more workers."
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   Right?
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:57.280]   Well, the reality is many of you have tried going to share the gospel and you know it's
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.200]   slim pickings.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.840]   The reality is many of you have gone out and felt like, "Oh my goodness, there's nothing
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.840]   out there."
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.880]   You see, we have the task of warning people.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:13.520]   God has called his people throughout all generations, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, everybody.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.960]   You go and warn the people around you that wrath is coming and if you don't warn them,
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.360]   their blood is on your hands.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.920]   Did you know that?
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:29.680]   You have this task, this crazy huge task of warning the people around you.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.240]   But here's the crazy part.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   Here's the crazy part.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.660]   In the New Testament, there was a rich man who lived his life to the fullest.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.840]   He enjoyed everything the world had to offer.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.260]   There was a poor man who was poor and begging, but the rich man wouldn't even give him anything.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.640]   The two die and guess what happens?
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.260]   The rich man is burning in hell and he looks up and he realizes the poor man is sitting
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.120]   next to Abraham's bosom and enjoying life.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.360]   And the rich man says, "Please, just give me a drop to quench my thirst."
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.640]   And Abraham says, "No.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.600]   There is a chasm between you and me and I can't do that."
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.840]   And so the rich man says, "Please, just send me.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840]   Send me to my brothers.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   They're wicked and stuff.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.840]   I just need to warn them."
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.680]   And you remember what Abraham says?
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:13.920]   "Even if you come back from the dead, they will not turn."
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.120]   The scenario that we have is an interesting scenario.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:24.440]   You and I are tasked with what is seemingly an impossible task, but please remember your
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:31.640]   motivation to go and persevere to be a light of the gospel to the people is not because
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.000]   you thought it was going to work.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.280]   It's because it's for the glory of God and whether people repent or don't repent, God
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:45.320]   will be glorified as the great holy God who had mercy, who sent his message to stubborn,
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.200]   stiff-necked people.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.320]   It reveals the nature of God's glory that even though there's a mass of people who are
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:37:01.200]   rushing towards the wide gate, he still makes his gospel spread to his servants.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.940]   That's just one way by which God is glorified.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.440]   So my challenge to you is not get discouraged because you've been out there and you're like,
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.680]   "Oh man, you know how hard it is and you just give up."
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.720]   No, whether people are hardened, whether people repent, whether people come around, whether
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:23.760]   they are pharaohs, people of high position, low position, whatever it may be, by us being
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   faithful to the task that God's plan of deliverance is going forward through us and his plan is
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.960]   golden, may God be honored.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.960]   Amen?
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.560]   Let's pray.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:47.120]   Lord God, we are all the more humbled that, Lord, you would reveal yourself to us.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.400]   And then we're then even more exceedingly humbled that you would so choose to place
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:59.200]   such a gracious, precious gospel in our hands to carry to the lost.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.480]   I pray, Father God, that every single individual here would hear this calling and God would
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.600]   not only just receive it but make it a part of their heart so that our hearts would be
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.480]   in tune with yours.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:17.160]   We know, Father God, that you are seeking the lost, you are seeking and pursuing sinners.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.960]   And I pray, Father Lord, that you would give us the same spirit and the same desire.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.520]   Lord, use this church, use every single individual, whether young or old, rich or poor, whatever
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:33.000]   life circumstances is in, that God we would truly be a light unto the dark place.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.860]   And in so doing, Lord, that we would give glory to you.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.960]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name, amen.
