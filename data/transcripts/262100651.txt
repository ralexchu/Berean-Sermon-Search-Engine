[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   It's an honor for me to be standing here before you today on this Palm Sunday.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.760]   My name is Peter Chung.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.720]   It's only at Berean I get called by my last name as well because people get confused with
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.840]   Pastor Peter, so it's Peter Chung.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.320]   So my name is Peter Chung and like Pastor Peter mentioned, I'll be rejoining the staff
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.320]   next Sunday.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:34.240]   I was one of the pastors here until 2009 and as Pastor Peter mentioned, in 2009 my wife
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.400]   and I were sent out to Beijing, China to lead the team there.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.320]   It was supposed to be a one-year chapter in Beijing that turned into a nine-year journey.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.800]   In 2012, we were planning to be in China long-term as Berean's full-time missionaries, but in
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.640]   2012 Compassion International recruited me to Korea to work as a vision trip leader and
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.560]   one of the main speakers for Compassion Sponsored Children and our global partner churches.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.280]   And I was working for Compassion in Korea for about five and a half years.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.280]   My main job was to take people to the field, so basically it was my job to travel.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.240]   I averaged about 56 flights a year, but whenever I flew, I visited children, families, and
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.000]   churches in the slums, fishing villages, dump sites, and rural hidden corners in various
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.520]   parts of the world.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.160]   And so on average, I spent about 100 days of the year with the poor.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.720]   So we were supposed to be away from Berean for just one year, but somehow it turned into
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.840]   nine, and our family's back, and we're looking forward to this new chapter in ministry.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.000]   I don't get nervous, but for some reason, first service, I was like super like nervous
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   and tense.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.160]   I'm not nervous now, okay, but I think we're nervous and excited just to be back.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.200]   Berean has changed a bit since we've been gone.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.080]   Jeremy was in elementary school when we left, and I'm the one who started Berean So, students
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.480]   of the word, but now all the kids that are in there, most of them didn't exist when we
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   were here.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.400]   There have been many changes, and at the same time, many things have remained the same.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.640]   I was just kind of tickled the other day when I saw on the church's Facebook page that the
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.360]   Passion Week chart, I made that for the church in 2008.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.600]   I was a little bit shocked that it's still being used.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.920]   The core values and the visions of the church and commitment to Christ and to his word have
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.520]   changed a little bit in the sense of it's gotten deeper, and so I'm so excited about
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   that, and I'm excited to jump back in.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.880]   So bear with us as we acclimate ourselves to living in the States, adjusting to this
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.360]   church and beginning this new chapter of our lives back at Berean.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.600]   I was at the cafe, and Jen and I said the most encouraging thing to me that I've heard
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   all week.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.520]   I told her, "I feel like a newcomer," and she's like, "I feel like a newcomer, too,"
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.960]   and that was so encouraging for some reason.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.360]   But we're looking forward to getting to know you and to doing life with you.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.840]   I'd like to start by reading our passage for today.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.800]   Please turn in your Bibles to Luke 11.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.960]   The passage is going to be up on the screen on the wall here, but I think it'll be helpful
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.120]   for you to have your Bibles open.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:35.320]   I'll be reading from verses 9 to 13, so Luke 11, verses 9 to 13.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.040]   And I tell you, "Ask, and it will be given to you.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.720]   Seek, and you will find.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   Knock, and it will be opened to you.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.800]   For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.680]   And to the one who knocks, it will be opened.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.720]   What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   serpent?
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.480]   Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.120]   If you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.080]   will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?"
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.760]   Let me pray for us briefly.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.680]   Lord, this is your day, and we pray that your word would be honored.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.600]   Help us to understand your heart.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.780]   Help us to understand your purposes in our lives, and help us to love Christ.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.400]   And I pray that we would leave here understanding you a little bit more and resembling Jesus
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.800]   a little bit more.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.760]   You are our audience, so would you receive our worship and our praise today?
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.400]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.920]   Today is Palm Sunday, the day in which we remember the Lord's triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.000]   As you guys know, Jesus enters Jerusalem on a donkey to shout of, "Hosanna to the Son
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   of David!
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.880]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.040]   Hosanna in the highest!"
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.320]   And you're going to see that all over your, like, Facebooks and stuff today.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   Hosanna!
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.080]   Hosanna in the highest!
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.880]   It says in Matthew 21, verse 10, that the entire city was stirred up.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.400]   Because they're saying, "Who is this?"
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.520]   And there was so much excitement in the crowd, the energy level was high, and everyone was
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.200]   waiting expectantly.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.240]   They were excited.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:36.320]   But just a few days later, many in this crowd would be crying out, "Crucify Him!
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.800]   Crucify Him!"
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.600]   Why?
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.040]   Because, over the course of the next few days, Jesus would turn out to be a very different
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.200]   Messiah from the one people expected.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:59.660]   You see, the Jews had been asking, they had been seeking, they had been beseeching the
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.920]   Lord of Heaven to come in power, to come in majesty, to come and restore.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:13.000]   They had been asking, they had been seeking, but they rejected the Son of David.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.200]   Why?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.680]   Maybe it's because Jesus loses it at the temple.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.680]   He angrily overturns tables and disrupts business.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.600]   He gets into heated debates with religious leaders, some of whom the people probably
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.440]   respect it.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.680]   And Jesus, over the next few days, teaches and says things that no Messiah of their choosing
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.120]   would ever dare to say.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.120]   So we see in the way Jesus' reception was over the course of the Passion Week, that
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.760]   there is often a world of a difference between who people think Jesus is and who He actually
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.680]   claims to be and who He is.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.960]   There's a huge gap between what people desire from Jesus and what He desires to give.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.540]   So who is this Jesus, this Son of David?
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.220]   And what does it mean for you and me to have a relationship with Him?
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.680]   What does it mean for us when we say, "Jesus Messiah"?
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.220]   What does it mean to ask things in Jesus' name?
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.440]   What does it mean for us to pray in faith?
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.840]   And I want us to think just through this together, what Jesus came to restore.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:37.820]   I want us to think through that by first examining how He exhorts us to approach the God of heaven.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:43.900]   So I'm going to be talking a little bit about our relationship to God the Father, what made
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.760]   that possible, and then I'll return back to the Triumphal Entry.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.320]   So in our passage today, Jesus finishes praying and the disciples come up to Him and ask Him
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.880]   to teach them how to pray.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.900]   It might be helpful for you and me to remember that His disciples were Jewish men who were
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.600]   likely not unfamiliar with prayer.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.560]   They probably grew up praying, watching and hearing others pray.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.720]   They grew up being taught the importance of prayer, and more than likely, they were praying
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.080]   men.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.960]   But it's not too far a stretch to imagine that something about prayer was difficult
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   for them.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.400]   If I asked you guys all to raise your hand if prayer is difficult, I'm sure all of you
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.160]   would raise your hand, but we're not going to do that, okay?
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.800]   Active participation, we won't do.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.520]   Well, you're participating, but not raising your hand, all right?
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.240]   Yes.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:50.120]   They didn't feel the intimacy with God that they sense Jesus had in His times of prayer.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:58.280]   So if you look at Luke 11, verse 1, it reads, "They asked, 'Lord, teach us how to pray.'"
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.000]   Remember, these are praying men.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.760]   "Lord, teach us how to draw near to God."
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.320]   And what follows is Luke's account of what we know as the Lord's Prayer.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.920]   And Jesus continues by exhorting them to persist in prayer.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:22.560]   And He puts it in terms ordinary people, ordinary disciples, ordinary folks like you and me
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.560]   can understand.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.440]   First, between verses 5 through 8, if you have your Bibles open, you can look at that.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.060]   He gives us the picture of a sleeping neighbor.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:40.120]   You pester him long enough, out of sheer annoyance, that sleeping neighbor, simply because of
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:45.640]   your audacity to ask for bread at such an hour, will get out of bed and give you three
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.320]   loaves.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:54.080]   So even an agitated neighbor, if you pester him long enough, will give you what you need
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.280]   just to get you to stop that knocking.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.820]   And Jesus says, "Persist in this way."
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.980]   So Jesus is putting prayer in terms that you and I can understand.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.800]   And then following this, Jesus goes on to ask a rhetorical question.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:20.320]   Luke 11 and 11 reads, "What father among you," or as the NIV states, "Which of you fathers?"
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.720]   So He's going to go into how we are to draw near to God.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.960]   And Jesus' point is this.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:33.480]   The relationship you enjoy with God is unlike the one you have with your buddy next door.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.880]   God is not your next door neighbor.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.200]   He is not just a good friend.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.080]   He's your father.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.040]   The one you are beseeching in prayer, He is the creator of the universe.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.920]   He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:52.280]   But at the same time, He's your "appa," your daddy, your father.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.680]   So ask and seek.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.200]   Because though He is the God of the universe, He is your father.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.920]   Though He is the King of kings and Lord of lords, you have access to Him.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.720]   Tim Keller, a couple months back, put this on his site.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:16.160]   The only person who dares wake up a king at 3 a.m. is his child.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.700]   And that's the kind of access you and I have.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:25.000]   The only person who dares wake up a king at 3 a.m. is a child.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.200]   This is my 18th year of pastoral ministry.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.960]   And in my 18 years of serving His church, there are a lot of things that I learned about
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.080]   my Heavenly Father.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.320]   First and foremost, I learned so much about God through His Word.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.000]   That has been my primary source.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   God's Word has changed me, has healed me, has fixed me, and is continuing to transform
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.040]   me.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:04.840]   And with His Word as the foundation of all of my ministry, over the last nine years,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:11.120]   God has deepened my understanding of His Word by expanding my worldview.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.480]   Spending time in communities in various parts of the world, I have felt deeply His broken
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.680]   heart for the lost and the poor.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.000]   Scripture says that God is close to the poor.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.120]   And you learn a lot about God as you spend time with those He is near to.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:35.040]   And my relationship with God through His Word, through my job, got even deeper once I became
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.380]   a father.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:43.240]   For many of you guys who don't know our family, Becky and I will be celebrating our 11th year
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.840]   – it goes fast – our 11th year anniversary later this week.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.320]   But the first eight years of our marriage, God did not give us children.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:04.420]   So we are 11 years in, and we are running around raising 35-month-old toddlers.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.940]   We are parents of a twin boy and a girl, and you can imagine how special they are to us
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.240]   because we waited for them.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.800]   We prayed for them.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.320]   We longed for them.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.040]   And we are thankful for them.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.080]   And one of the advantages of raising a twin boy and a girl is their development is at
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   the same time.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's at the same level.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.520]   And our love for them is the same because they appeared at once.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.240]   And we don't have a firstborn – I mean, we do, it's usually pulled out first – but
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.560]   we don't have a firstborn or a youngest.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.860]   So we love them equally, albeit a little bit differently depending on their need.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.840]   And as I have been interacting with them, caring for them, and investing in them, there
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:59.480]   are many things that I, an evil father, have learned about my Heavenly Father.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.020]   And I'm just going to share two things about what I've learned about God the Father through
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.520]   my heart's transformation in front of my kids.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:14.800]   First, lesson one, fathers discipline their children in love.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.740]   It says, "Though you are evil, you know how to give good things to your children."
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:27.400]   I am a sinful, fleshly, selfish human being, but I know how to give good things to my kids.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.840]   And one of those good things is actually discipline.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.120]   Revelation 3.19, God says to His church, "Those whom I love I reprove and discipline, so be
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120]   zealous and repent."
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:46.440]   Hebrews 12.6, "For the Lord disciplines the one He loves and chastises every son He
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.800]   receives."
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   The Greek word for discipline is paidouo, if you want to spell it, it's P-A-I-D-E-U-W.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:03.480]   And when you say paidouo, there is both a positive and a negative feel for this word.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:09.040]   There is a negative discipline given in response to behavior or attitude that needs correcting.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.720]   But at the same time, there is a positive one, a discipline that is used for teaching,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.160]   instruction, and training.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.840]   So nod your heads if you think discipline is a good thing, yeah?
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.360]   Discipline is good, right?
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.400]   A good father disciplines his children not because he hates them, but because he loves
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   them.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.520]   And we all know this.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.720]   And we know it intuitively, even if our parents are imperfect.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:38.040]   And as a child changes, the parent's discipline will change.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.160]   In Korean, we call a spanking, what do we call spanking in Korean?
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.600]   Oh yeah, you guys are passionate about this.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.600]   Memme, right?
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.640]   I typed it out, it said meme, but it's like memme.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.740]   So when the child is little, fathers will give memme to their children.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.160]   But there comes an age where memme is no longer appropriate.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.400]   It'll only make it worse.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:08.140]   If you give memme to a high school-aged boy, that's not going to be a good thing, right?
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:15.080]   So as a child changes, the discipline that the father takes with the child will also
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   change and adjust.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.980]   So as a child becomes an adult, the father's discipline may be more informed in the form
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.140]   of a counsel or advice.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.580]   So as a child changes, the father's change.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.340]   My twins are almost three.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.660]   Our son's name is Matthias, we call him Maddie.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:39.260]   So the first, I vividly remember this, the first time I ever gave Maddie a memme, when
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.400]   he was just over a year old.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.300]   So during dinner, he had the habit of throwing food down to the ground.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.960]   And we needed to fix this.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.380]   So he would put some in his mouth, throw some on the ground, put some in his mouth, throw
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.720]   some on the ground, and that drove my wife nuts.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.120]   So I said, "Maddie, no, no, no."
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.660]   He looked at me, he was like, "Hey, no, no, no."
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.540]   And then he threw more on the ground.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.000]   So I was like, "Uh-oh, okay.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.920]   We got to do some advanced discipline."
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:20.540]   So I took a little ruler, and I took out his hand, and I whacked his hand.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.040]   Immediately tears filled his eyes, and he started crying.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.400]   I did not enjoy that.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.360]   It was actually painful for me.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.540]   He doesn't throw food on the ground anymore.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.100]   I didn't enjoy it, but I deemed it necessary at the time, so he got a little memme.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.300]   Our daughter, Karis, had the same problem.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.780]   But the thing with Karis was that memme at that time didn't work.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:53.300]   When you memme Karis, she would be like, "Hehehe," which is super scary.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:59.860]   But worse than that, when we were looking, she would take a ruler and whack her dolls.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.620]   "Memme, memme."
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:07.060]   And then if her brother came near her, she would go, "Memme, memme," and she would
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.200]   whack him on the head.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:15.140]   So we're like, "Okay, this ruler doesn't work on my daughter."
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.840]   What we found out worked was isolating her on a timeout.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.100]   We put her in the room, and she would scream bloody murder.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.500]   See, if we put Maddie in a room by himself, he would find something to do, play with his
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.980]   toes, play with the bars of the crib.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.340]   But Karis would not like that.
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.540]   Two different kids, two different forms of discipline to fit each child.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:42.500]   We took no pleasure in disciplining our children, but at times, we deemed it necessary.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.980]   I have not once been excited to put my child on a timeout or a memme or to take away a
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.580]   toy.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:58.580]   And not once did I give my kids a memme without explaining why they're getting a memme.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.940]   So if I gave them a memme and said, "Guess why you got hit?"
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.060]   That's a weird fathering trait, right?
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.620]   We will always make it clear when our kids are being disciplined, because that's parenting
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.020]   common sense.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:18.120]   No father will discipline his child and tell him to guess, and even bad fathers know not
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   to do this.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.540]   So this is something that's very important to remember as you relate to the Lord.
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:29.740]   When our heavenly Father disciplines us because of our sin or our disobedience, I believe
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:35.700]   with all my heart that He will always make it clear why.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:41.940]   If God the Father is disciplining us, He will always make it clear why.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.980]   And why is this important to remember?
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.500]   Because there are times where life is not fun.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.780]   And things happen.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.900]   And life hurts.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.940]   And sometimes we feel like, "Is God punishing me for something?"
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.620]   You guys understand that sentiment?
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.580]   So if you cannot understand why something difficult is happening in your life, if you
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:10.580]   cannot understand the reason behind a struggle, God is not punishing you or disciplining you
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:15.500]   for something you've done wrong as a judgment.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:22.900]   John chapter 9, the disciples ask about a blind man, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.420]   or his parents, that he was born blind?"
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:31.100]   And Jesus answered, "It was not that this man sinned or his parents, but that the works
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:37.660]   of God might be displayed in him."
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.780]   God never disciplines without explaining to His children why we're being disciplined,
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:48.220]   and this is something that I, as an evil father, have come to understand.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:54.020]   When life gets tough, we're not necessarily getting spiritual memmeh, but it's a different
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.660]   kind of discipline.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:03.020]   Trials, hardships, and suffering, especially those you can't understand or explain, will
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:10.300]   always be for your good or for the good of His other children.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.140]   Let me repeat that.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:19.060]   Trials, hardships, suffering, especially those you can't understand or explain, will always
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.740]   be for your good or for good.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:29.620]   Hebrews 12, 11, "For the moment, all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.100]   it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.500]   Trials, hardships, and suffering will always be for good or for your good.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.900]   So negative discipline is in response to a behavior that needs to be fixed.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.260]   Positive discipline comes in the form of instruction, teaching, or training.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.900]   One of the things that we are working really hard right now to teach our kids is how to
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.900]   share.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.700]   Yeah, you guys, you parents in here, that's not an easy thing, right?
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.420]   To teach them how to share.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:09.140]   But this is another good thing that I, as an evil man, know how to give to my children.
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:19.580]   In my visits to the poor, I have seen a lot of depressing and very painful things.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:25.780]   And when we would go visit these communities, the compassion sponsors who would go with
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.420]   me, a lot of them would break down and cry because people should not be living like this.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:38.820]   One older, he was in his early 70s, non-Christian sponsor actually said this, "Poverty is God's
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.820]   fault."
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:46.500]   And I could understand the logic because if God is all powerful, all knowing, and truly
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.240]   good, why do such horrible things happen?
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.860]   Why is there so much injustice?
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.220]   Why does 40% of the world struggle just to eat once a day?
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.580]   I met a mother in Ethiopia who had nine children.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:09.220]   Eight of them she buried before they turned five.
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:14.380]   And she blamed herself for each of their deaths.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.760]   Why God, why?
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.940]   Why do you nothing?
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.740]   Why do you not intervene?
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.740]   Is a cry in my heart.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.900]   See, I trust in God's goodness, but there are oftentimes tension in my heart when I
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:33.800]   see things in this world that are unjust and painful to look at.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.880]   So when that sponsor said, "Poverty is God's fault," God kind of gave me a quick insight,
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.080]   and I want to share that with you.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:47.640]   In order to teach our kids how to share, in the mornings when I have baby duty, I will
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:53.080]   pour milk into both their bottles, and I mean, I would give it to each of them, but
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.640]   sometimes I would give both of them to one kid.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.960]   And I would say, "Here, Maddie, go share it with Charis," or, "Here, Charis, go give
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   it to Maddie."
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.880]   And then they would run along and just, "Here," and just give it to, and I'll say, "Maddie,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.800]   say thank you," or, "Charis, say thank you."
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.520]   Because we want to teach them how to share and how to give thanks.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.200]   Milk is easy because it's like an everyday thing for them.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.520]   But you know what's hard?
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.240]   Caca.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.440]   Cookies are hard.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.760]   So I tried it with cookies.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.320]   I gave Maddie two cookies, and I said, "Hey, you give one to Charis."
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:37.520]   And Charis is like, turned to Maddie and had her hands open, but Maddie ran away that way.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.520]   And homie's fast.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.960]   He's like running, and I tried to get him, and I was like, "Hey," and then he went, boom,
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.760]   and he put both cookies in his mouth.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.720]   You know who Charis looked at, screaming?
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.680]   She didn't look at Maddie when she was screaming.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.800]   She looked at me, crying and screaming her head off.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.120]   Why?
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.260]   I caused this injustice.
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:10.320]   So she was screaming because I did nothing to stop Maddie from committing this horrible
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   evil.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.040]   She was wronged.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.320]   What was rightfully hers is now in his stomach, so she's mad.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.020]   And I didn't seem to care, and I let it happen.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.600]   So what's a father to do?
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.240]   Now as a father, I could intervene.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   Snatch the cookie from Maddie.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   No, time out.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   Memme.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.680]   Snatch it away and give it to Charis.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:42.160]   But see, I don't want my kids to learn how to share out of compulsion or fear of punishment.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.520]   I want them to learn how to share from the heart.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:53.000]   So I will wait, even at the expense of the unfairness that one of the kids feels at the
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.560]   moment.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.040]   You guys understand, right?
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:06.000]   God has given me wisdom to wait, but in their little minds, I did a wrong thing.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.400]   A few months ago, I was sitting at the dining table.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   Maddie was sitting next to me.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.840]   I was over there in the corner playing with a doll.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.320]   And Maddie said, "I want a tangerine."
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.680]   So I opened the refrigerator, peeled the tangerine, and I just gave it to him without thinking
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.480]   because I was writing an email on my phone.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:31.000]   And then he took the tangerine, he split it in half, ran over to where Charis was, and
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.920]   gave her the other half, not because I told him to, because I wasn't paying attention
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.880]   because I was on my phone.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:42.720]   He did it because that was just now a natural thing for him to do.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.720]   And I was so excited.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.720]   I was super happy.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.720]   I was like, "Dude, I win!
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   I did it!
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   I succeeded as a dad!"
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:27:02.040]   See a lot of times, the discipline that God allows to take place in our lives, the positive
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:09.160]   kind when our lives are hard, is sometimes for the good of those around you.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:14.920]   And in His wisdom, God waits so that the body of Christ can often rejoice with those who
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:22.160]   rejoice, mourn with those who mourn, like we've been learning in Romans.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.240]   Lesson one, fathers discipline their children in love.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.960]   Second, fathers delight in their children and desire to give them the best of everything.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.840]   These are things that I, as an evil father, have come to learn.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   I love my kids.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.840]   Can you tell?
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.520]   Yeah, I love them.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.760]   They're objectively cute.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:49.600]   Because I waited and prayed so long, eight years, for them, I enjoy spending time with
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.240]   them and I love watching them grow and change.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.240]   I love coming home and as soon as I walk in the door, my children run.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.240]   They go, "Daddy, daddy!"
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.240]   And they run.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   And that's like my favorite part of the day.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.160]   I don't care if they broke things, made a mess, or were bad babies that day.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.600]   The best part of my day is when I go home and see my children, scoop them up, smother
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.640]   them with hugs and kisses, roll around.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.280]   I love hearing them laugh.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.660]   I enjoy just watching them play.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.120]   When music comes on, sometimes my daughter dances.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:24.240]   It's the awkwardest, ugliest thing, but it's so cute.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.880]   I love watching them do silly stuff, like put underwear on their head.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.200]   The other day, Karis blew her nose by herself.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.760]   I was super excited.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.680]   I was like, "Wow, baby!
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.840]   You blew your own nose!
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   Nice!"
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.360]   And she beamed because she was like, "Oh, daddy was so proud."
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.800]   I love watching them do ordinary, silly, stupid things.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.080]   Why?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.360]   Because I love them and because they're mine.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:08.240]   How much more does God enjoy watching us do silly and stupid and ordinary things and just
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.480]   beam at us?
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.080]   I want to give them the best of everything.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.640]   When I go to Target, I went yesterday, I brought back home a toy.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:26.520]   I always visit the toy section because I want to give my kids stuff, but I do not because
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.280]   some toys they're not ready for.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.720]   Some toys would be harmful for them.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:39.000]   I may get it for them later, but not now because they're too little.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.760]   Scripture says, "What father among you, if a son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:52.400]   give him a serpent, or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?"
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.680]   A snake is not good for food.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.600]   It's dangerous.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.040]   No father will give his child a scorpion for food or even for a pet.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.720]   Even a bad father knows not to do this.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.840]   Even a stupid father knows not to do this.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.320]   So even selfish and stupid fathers desire to give their children good things.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.560]   They want to give their children things that will benefit them.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.800]   Lesson one, fathers discipline their children in love.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.920]   Two, fathers delight in their children and want to give them the best of everything.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:32.040]   It says, "If you then being evil, I love my kids, but if you asked me, do I love my kids
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.280]   more than I love myself?
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:40.520]   I'd probably say no.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:45.520]   I mean if I had to defend my kids with my life or sacrifice my body for them, I'm pretty
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.960]   sure I would.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:53.400]   But do I love Maddie and Karis more than I love me?
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:31:00.560]   I'd have a very hard time answering that because I love myself a lot.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.080]   I'm selfish.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:08.280]   And there are times, even though I love my children, where my parenting is affected negatively
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.440]   because of my selfishness.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.920]   When I haven't slept much and I'm tired and cranky and grumpy, my interaction with my
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.200]   kids might not be positive.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.000]   When I'm under a lot of stress, I can be a bad dad.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.520]   When there are difficulties in my relationship with Rebecca, Becky, my kids will be affected.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:39.440]   But even as a self-centered, selfish, weak, sinful father, I won't deliberately give my
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.640]   kids things that are harmful for them.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.680]   Does it make sense?
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.800]   How many of you love your kids?
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.680]   You don't have to answer, but how many of you love your kids?
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.160]   I know your love isn't perfect and it's a struggle, but you love your kids.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.880]   I love my kids.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.200]   But you know what radically changed in my relationship with God?
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:16.080]   When I came to the realization that God loves me more than I love my kids.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.720]   God loves me with a fierce, intense, passionate love a whole lot more than I could ever love
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.040]   my kids.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:31.000]   God loves you more than you love your kids.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.800]   And His love is perfect.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.480]   He is never in a bad mood.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.040]   He is never tired or sleep deprived.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.120]   He is never in disagreement with Himself.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.600]   So if you have been adopted into the family of God, your Abba Father loves you with a
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.000]   fierce intensity.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.520]   It's a relentless, passionate love.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.840]   And He loves you so much more than you could ever love your kids.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.320]   And I want that to sink in.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:10.560]   Because if that does, the next time you pray Luke 11, "Our Father in Heaven," your heart
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.400]   will beat differently.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:21.960]   Sunday worship will be special because it's time with Dad.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.000]   If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.160]   God give the Holy Spirit to those who love Him or to those who ask Him?
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.520]   This is a slight tangential, but I feel worth bringing up.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:39.360]   As I was preparing this sermon, there was a little bit of a tension in my heart.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.920]   Two groups of people came to mind, and it caused me to stop and pray.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:50.720]   The first group is for those of you who have had objectively bad earthly fathers.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.320]   And I want you to call your attention back to the beginning of verse 13, "If you then
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.640]   though you are evil."
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:03.480]   For you guys, first, don't allow your bitterness toward your earthly father keep you from opening
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:09.160]   up your heart to the Heavenly Father who loves you perfectly.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:16.200]   And second, remember, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:25.520]   There is need for Christ for all, and there is need of grace for all.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:33.180]   The second group that I felt burdened for as I was preparing this sermon are the barren
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.180]   and the childless.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.180]   "Oh yeah, Peter, great.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.180]   You waited eight years.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:39.760]   God gave you kids.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.680]   Nice to be you."
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:47.160]   There's a little bit of guilt and pain as I was preparing this because I felt like I'm
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.920]   almost gloating about being a dad.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:57.920]   We were childless for most of our marriage, so I've been there.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.840]   What I want to share with you who are waiting is this.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.080]   God hears you.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.800]   He loves you.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:16.560]   No prayer of yours falls on deaf ears.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.480]   Where you are at, give Him glory.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:29.040]   You know, something really challenged me within the last year as I was thinking through how
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:35.560]   to pray and encourage others who are waiting for children.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:40.920]   You know, when you pray for a child, it's an earnest prayer.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.720]   It's a desperate prayer.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.120]   Months and months of waiting and being disappointed.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:56.240]   There's a sense of like, it's not even frustration because you can't control this.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.760]   But you know what dawned on me?
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.520]   You know what's more of an earnest prayer?
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:08.760]   You know what's more of a prayer that can hit the heart of God?
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.480]   It's a prayer of a child who doesn't have parents.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.000]   So perhaps God is moving your heart to love on an adopted child as if he were your own
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.560]   flesh and blood.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.360]   Do it if you can.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   God hears you.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.360]   He loves you.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:29.800]   He desires the wholeness and completeness of your family more than you do.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:35.560]   These are tangential, but I wanted to address that.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.800]   And I tell you, ask and it will be given to you.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.880]   Seek and you will find.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.960]   Knock and it will be opened to you.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.560]   For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.000]   To the one who knocks it will be opened.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.160]   And what father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160]   a serpent?
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.520]   Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.680]   If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.000]   more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.160]   So what are we to be asking, seeking, and knocking for?
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.720]   Do you guys ever think about that?
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   You know this verse, right?
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.040]   It's also in Matthew 6.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.800]   Ask and you shall receive.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.400]   Seek and you will find.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.520]   Knock and the door will be opened.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.880]   You've heard this before, but what is it that we're supposed to be asking, seeking, and
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.480]   knocking for?
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:27.920]   Verse 13 gives you the answer.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.680]   The Holy Spirit?
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.640]   That's weird.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:42.040]   If we're asking God with all our hearts, seeking and knocking, he's going to give the Holy
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.040]   Spirit?
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.960]   And you guys remember, the disciples didn't have really a concept of who the Holy Spirit
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.960]   was.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.120]   So this is kind of going to be weird for them.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.480]   But for you and I, as we look upon this passage, it makes sense.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:06.340]   Because the greatest things that I can give to these kids that I love are not objects.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:14.640]   The biggest blessings and gifts I can give to Maddie and Karis are not a house, money,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.720]   or a good education, right?
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:24.680]   If you're a parent, the best thing you can give to your kids are not physical, material
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.920]   things.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.120]   No, the best thing I can give to my children is my heart.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.680]   The best gift a father can give to his children is himself.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.680]   And you guys all understand this.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.000]   A young child might not understand this.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.240]   But as a child gets older, what happens?
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:53.760]   More than the stuff, more than the gifts, they grow to love the giver.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:39:01.860]   I appreciate and understand my sinful father now more than I did when I was 15.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.560]   When I was a kid, I appreciated or I didn't appreciate my father for what he could or
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.880]   he couldn't give me.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:17.320]   Now I appreciate my father and value him just because he's my father.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.760]   And he's the reason we moved back.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:29.680]   The best thing that God can give you and me is not health and wealth, comfort and riches,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.880]   although so much of our prayer lives are just focused on that.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.800]   The best thing that God can give you and me is a relationship with him.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.080]   Amen?
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:46.120]   But some of us who are spiritual toddlers, we still want the stuff.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.440]   Some of us who are spiritually impetuous teens would prefer the health and the wealth and
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.720]   comfort and riches because daddy can buy it.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.860]   Daddy can give it to us.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.640]   How mature are you in your faith?
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.200]   How do you gauge how mature you are in your faith?
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.240]   Answer this question honestly in your heart and you'll get your answer.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:16.200]   Is your relationship with God a means or the goal?
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:23.040]   Is your relationship with God a means or the goal?
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.200]   Because the best thing that God can give to his people is not stuff.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.440]   It is a gift of Emmanuel.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.160]   Amen?
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.560]   John 17 3, this is eternal life.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.400]   It's not just about enjoying heaven on earth and then going to heaven and enjoying heavenly
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.400]   heaven.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.400]   Okay?
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   What is eternal life?
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:47.800]   That they may know you, the only true God in Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.240]   If you say the thing about it, this gift, ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.280]   find, knock and the door will be open and then the heavenly father will give you a Holy
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.920]   Spirit.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:03.800]   This is strange stuff to the first century Jew.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.000]   First of all, the disciples who asked Jesus to teach them how to pray at this time didn't
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.240]   have quite an understanding of who the Holy Spirit was.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.320]   Ask seek, knock and your father in heaven who is good, who is keeper of promises and
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.520]   covenants will give you the spirit.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.140]   The first century Jew had a few things he prayed passionately about.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.840]   He prayed passionately that the Messiah would come.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.020]   Why did the first century Jew pray for the Messiah to come?
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:37.040]   Because the Messiah would come to deliver the people of Israel from their oppressors.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:42.440]   The Jew would pray for the Messiah to come in might, in power to restore and liberate
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:49.600]   Israel and to return Israel's wealth, their fame and their land.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.440]   This was promised to Abraham's descendants by God the father.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:58.880]   Messiah come because we're sick of these pagan oppressors.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.640]   Give us back our wealth, our land and our fame.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:10.560]   If I were a first century Jew at first hearing on this Holy Spirit, I would say no thanks.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.220]   I want the wealth.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.120]   I want the fame.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.520]   I want the land.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:24.400]   I don't want to have these pagan Romans scoffing at me, making me carry his armor for a mile.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.360]   I want relief.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.120]   I want what you promised to our forefathers.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.600]   So many first century Jews, for many first century Jews, a covenant relationship with
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:41.560]   God was a means, not a goal.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.880]   Matthew 21.9, "And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, 'Hosanna
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.920]   to the son of David.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.720]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.080]   Hosanna in the highest.'
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.400]   The crowd shouted, 'Hosanna in the highest.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.880]   Hosanna in the highest.'"
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.400]   But what does that mean?
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:10.280]   The word Hosanna comes from the combination of two Hebrew words, yasha, which means deliver
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.280]   or save.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:18.220]   If you're taking notes, Y-A-S-H-A, deliver or save, yasha.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:24.000]   And then, Anna, like Anna, the name, beg or beseech.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Yasha, deliver, save.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.200]   Anna, we beg you, we beseech you, we implore you.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.400]   And the word Hosanna is found only once in the Old Testament.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.480]   Psalm 118, verses 25 to 26, it reads, "Save us, we pray.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.040]   O Lord, O Lord, we pray.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   Give us success.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.680]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.900]   We bless you in the house of the Lord.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.680]   We bless you from the house of the Lord."
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:05.600]   Over time, in Israel, Hosanna started becoming a declaration of praise, like, "Hooray!
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.600]   Hooray!
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.600]   Hooray!
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   Manseh!
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   Yoo-hoo!"
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   That's what it became.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.040]   But the meaning is, "Save us!
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.560]   We beg you."
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.080]   So the crowds literally were shouting, "I beg you to save!
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   Please deliver us!"
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.860]   They were crying for salvation.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:34.000]   But over the course of the Passion Week, over the next few days, they stopped shouting this.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.040]   And by Friday, their shouts turned into, "Crucify him."
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.440]   Why?
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:51.480]   Because this Son of David wasn't delivering what they wanted to receive.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.520]   On this Palm Sunday, do you shout, "Hosanna to the King of Kings!
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   Glory in the highest!"
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.520]   You're going to sing that after this.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.520]   We're going to sing.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.520]   That's all.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:08.920]   But why do you shout, "Hosanna"?
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.720]   What do you desire to be saved from?
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   "Hosanna!
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.880]   We beseech you to save and deliver us!"
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.040]   What is it that you desire to be saved from?
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:28.520]   Because many in today's church want to be saved from comfort or discomfort.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.360]   They want to be saved from anxiety.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:37.880]   They want to be saved from boredom.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:44.920]   More and fewer people desire to be saved from their sins and restored to the Creator.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   You are the God who saves us, worthy of all our praises.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:55.960]   We will sing that.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.020]   What are you singing?
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:04.600]   Salvation from your discomfort, anxiety, and boredom?
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:11.840]   Or are you singing with a desire to be restored to your Maker?
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.560]   You are the God who saves us, worthy of all our praises.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.000]   "Hosanna!"
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.700]   Is He worthy of praise only when your life is good?
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.760]   What is the significance of remembering this Passion Week?
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.920]   What is the significance of remembering the Passion Week?
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:36.160]   It's to remember the means by which our adoption into the family of God came.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:41.560]   To remember the means by which our sonship and our access came.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:46.360]   The means by which the gift of eternal life came.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.120]   Eternal life for you and me came at a cost.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:58.920]   Jesus' life, sacrificial death, and resurrection have given us access to this good, good Father.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.400]   Remember Tim Keller's quote?
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:09.480]   "The only person who dares to wake up a king at 3 a.m. for a glass of water is his
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   child."
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.040]   He has that kind of access.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.840]   So is Christ your Lord and Savior?
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.120]   If Christ is your Lord and Savior, you have been adopted into God's family.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.360]   Hallelujah!
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:24.520]   And you have a good Father.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.860]   And this Father loves you perfectly.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.560]   This Father loves you passionately.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.460]   He loves you sacrificially.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:45.040]   He loves you more than you could ever love anybody else.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:54.200]   So when you cry out, "Hosanna, come have your way among us," may that praise and that
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.440]   prayer just be, "God, I just want you.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.640]   I don't want anything else.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.760]   I just want you."
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:10.800]   I would like to close with a passage for us to read.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:17.240]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:21.920]   with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.100]   Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:34.400]   before him, in love he predestined us for adoption through Jesus Christ, whom we remember
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.560]   this week.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.680]   According to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.920]   has blessed us in the beloved.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.880]   Today's Palm Sunday.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.840]   This week is Passion Week.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:58.120]   May this week and the events this week cause you to reflect on the love of our heavenly
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.200]   Father and on the love that he has for us.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:12.560]   That while we were yet hostile, rebellious, sinful, selfish men and women, Christ died
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:24.040]   for us to restore us to the Father, because that is the best thing he could ever give.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.680]   May you remember Christ this week.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:37.120]   May you remember that you're God, that your Daddy loves you, and he loves you passionately.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.400]   Amen?
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:43.480]   Let's pray.
