[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews 11.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.520]   We're continuing our series with the heroes of faith in Hebrews 11.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.280]   We talked about Adam, sorry not Adam, Abel.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.120]   And the second person up is Enoch.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:36.960]   So we're going to be reading verse 5 and 6 and reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.780]   By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death, and he was not found because
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.920]   God took him up.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.760]   For he obtained a witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.200]   And without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.920]   that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.920]   Father, we pray for your mercy.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.160]   We pray, Father God, that your anointed word would shape our hearts, our thoughts, our
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.360]   hopes, our joy, our life.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.120]   We ask, Lord God, that you would bless this time.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.480]   You know, I think this Friday, I think many of you who are here, we had an opportunity
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.280]   to pray together, and I think we were all very encouraged by our two sisters, Dawn and
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.600]   Ariel, as they are experiencing, again, some persecution because of standing up for their
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.080]   Christian faith.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.280]   About how, again, right now with anybody who's in the medical field with, you know, gender
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.600]   transition therapy that's going on, and they're beginning to ask medical workers to sign saying
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.560]   that they approve this or for this, and just by saying that they don't agree, you know,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.960]   they are receiving intense persecution for that.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.720]   And again, you know, going forward, I think that is going to be happening more and more.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   We've always known persecution was going to come.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.840]   I've mentioned it before.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.960]   You know, at some point in our life, we knew it was going to come, but what is surprising
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.480]   is just how quickly it came, that we have currently a presidential candidate who has
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.640]   openly said that if you go against the LGBTQ agenda, that you will be put on a terrorist
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.680]   list, that we're not going to be able to hide against our religious freedom to mask our
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.160]   hatred and racism.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.480]   And so therefore, they're going to be passing laws or preventing churches from basically
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   practicing our faith that we believe to be true in Scripture.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.540]   So the fact that that is here, whether he gets elected or not, the general social setting
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.600]   right now has adopted that.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.920]   So the question that we have to ask ourselves and answer ahead of time, have we counted
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.360]   the cost?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.440]   The Bible clearly tells us, and those of you who are starting through Thessalonians, Paul
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.600]   says in a short period of time that he was there, he warned them again and again that
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.960]   this is what's going to happen.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.760]   If you follow Jesus Christ, persecution is going to come.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.800]   And he's writing this letter to make sure that they're withstanding the persecution.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.020]   Well, what you and I have been experiencing in America is very unique to us.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.360]   This is not normal Christianity.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.200]   We look at what's going on in North Korea and India and China, missionaries who are
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   being kicked out and having to find new places to evangelize.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.140]   This is happening all over the world.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.240]   What is unique is what you and I have experienced during our lifetime.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.840]   And that is possibly coming to an end pretty quickly.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.880]   That there is going to come a time, whether it is in months, I don't think in decades,
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.980]   where there is going to be a litmus test.
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.720]   If you want to be a part of the university as a student, there may be a statement that
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.580]   you have to sign off on in order for you to be accepted.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.540]   And you're going to be faced with the decision, am I going to compromise in order to be a
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.520]   student in this university?
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.800]   Am I going to, in order to get a bank loan, am I going to have to deny my faith to do
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.100]   that?
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.500]   Right now, a lot of the school teachers in California are beginning to face that scrutiny
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.260]   in order to be a credentialed teacher, CTA is pushing hard that you must.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.220]   They're going to weed out anybody who doesn't profess and is going to push their agenda,
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.220]   which is directly against what we profess in scripture.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.740]   If we do not, and if we are not prepared for that, and you don't deal with that until that
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.500]   time comes, the odds that we will end up compromising or somehow we will justify that the only way
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.260]   for us to survive is to compromise.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.940]   At least publicly deny the faith even though inwardly that we believe something different.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.820]   And that's why the Bible has been telling us over and over again to count the cost.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.820]   There will come a day where it will be difficult or impossible for you to be a teacher in California.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.220]   Anybody who's in the medical field, I think you already know the pressure.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.580]   Whether you are a student or a medical doctor or you're a nurse, whatever it is in the medical
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:34.420]   field that has been already being pushed vigorously, hired for a job, you're being threatened left
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.420]   and right.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.420]   Some of you guys may already feel that.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.640]   Some of you guys see it coming.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.300]   Maybe some of us are unaware, but that persecution is already here.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.680]   I say all of this because this is directly related to the passage that we're looking
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.020]   at in Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.600]   These are the same people at one point in the beginning when the persecution started,
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.060]   they were joyfully willing to have their stuff confiscated.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.620]   They visited their friends who were going to jail and they were supporting them.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.420]   But the problem was it didn't relent.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.740]   In fact, it kept on growing.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.020]   And so after years of this, they begin to drift back to their old life.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.300]   They were not denying Christ.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.560]   So if you look at Hebrews and the things that we studied, we know that he's not dealing
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   necessarily with specifics of Christology that they were denying.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.300]   Because the thing that was happening is they were just compromising.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.300]   They were just drifting.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.060]   They weren't taking their faith seriously.
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.940]   And so they were taking a bit of the persecutors, their doctrines of Judaism, and they were
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.940]   synchronizing.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.100]   They were mixing it up with the Christian faith so that they would not be persecuted
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.480]   by the Christians or the Jews.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.820]   They were trying to maintain a life where they can have it all.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.620]   And so they were beginning to drift into their old way of life to avoid some of this persecution.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.500]   So the pressure was beginning to get to them.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   And that's why the author of Hebrews was writing to them to be anchored in Christ, to be anchored
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.980]   in Christ, to be anchored in Christ, not to drift.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.300]   And that's where we are here in chapter 11, because he's writing to people who are in
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.220]   the midst of intense persecution to hold on strong.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.900]   And it is absolutely relevant to our current situation.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.780]   So again, some of you guys I've already talked to are experiencing intense pressure.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.180]   Some of you guys see it coming.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.300]   A few of you may not know what's going on.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.980]   But we, again, our political leaders have openly said that they are not going to allow
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:38.220]   biblical Christianity to go unpunished.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.180]   You know, the benefit of living in the United States was that this country is founded upon
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.500]   people who are escaping religious persecution.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.580]   And so one of the greatest freedoms that you and I have experienced in this country is
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.460]   freedom of religion, that we are able to live out our faith.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.460]   And when they signed into their document the separation of church and state, it was for
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.440]   the purpose of protecting the church, that the state would not come in and mandate what
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.780]   you can and cannot believe inside the walls of your church.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.320]   It was not for the purpose of protecting the government.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.940]   It was exactly the opposite.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.980]   Now the tides have turned, and they're interpreting that as, we cannot allow the churches to dictate
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.780]   what we have in government, even if we have to shut some of these things down.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:30.140]   Well, like I said, what you and I have experienced in this country has been a blessing, but it
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.820]   is not out of the ordinary.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.100]   It is not unbiblical that this stage may be passing by.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.220]   You and I are entering into a stage in this country where nominal Christianity will not
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.380]   be tolerated.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.940]   You can't casually no longer walk with God.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.700]   You have to count the cost.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.860]   You have to examine, do I really believe this?
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.660]   Is Christ better than everything else that I desire and want and covet in this world?
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.460]   And whether we are willing to face that decision or not, the world is going to force us to
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.580]   make that decision.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.660]   I believe we are there.
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.660]   We're not years away.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.820]   We're not decades away.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.740]   We're right there.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.860]   And so what he has to say in Hebrews, in Hebrews chapter 11, is directly related to us.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.700]   Now we're going to ask, well, what does this have to do with Enoch?
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.940]   We don't know a whole lot about Enoch.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.940]   In fact, we know the least about Enoch of all the heroes of faith in this chapter.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:29.620]   Now, the first question that we ask is, how did Enoch get on this hall of fame with Noah
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.620]   and Abraham?
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.060]   In fact, in the Old Testament, we only have maybe two or three verses on Enoch.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.460]   And that all we know about Enoch was he walked with God.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.460]   He had a child named Methuselah who happened to live the longest life.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:49.220]   And then the reason why we know about Enoch is because he's the first one out of two of
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.460]   all the saints in the Old Testament who didn't physically die.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.460]   He was taken up.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.660]   And that's the only thing that we know about Enoch.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.780]   And yet he made it onto this hall of fame of faith.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.700]   So doesn't that make you curious?
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.620]   What is it about Enoch that he's presenting to us as an example to challenge us, to encourage
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.300]   us to persevere in our faith and not to drift?
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.520]   Well, there's three things that I want to look at.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.740]   There's three things that I want to look at about the faith because if you look at verse
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.740]   five and verse six, they are connected.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.780]   Oftentimes we look at verse six of Hebrews chapter 11 verse six, "Without faith it is
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.780]   impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that he is and that he
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.700]   is a rewarder of those who seek him."
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.620]   This is one of the verses that I quote quite a bit.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.740]   But in fact, chapter 11 verse five is actually connected to this verse.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.380]   That's actually a description of Enoch's faith because if you look at verse five, this is
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.220]   all it says, "By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death and he was
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.580]   not found because God took him up, for he obtained a witness that before his being taken
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.140]   up he was pleasing to God."
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:07.900]   So verse five ends by saying Enoch was pleasing to God and verse six begins by saying it is
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.600]   impossible to please God without faith.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.220]   So verse five and verse six is connected.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.540]   Verse six really is an explanation of how Enoch pleased God.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.300]   So I want to look at three things that we see in verse six.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:29.940]   One, we hear that "By faith Enoch pleased God by believing."
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.060]   By faith Enoch pleased God by believing.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.580]   This is the first of the three points I want to make this morning.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.820]   By faith Enoch pleased God by believing.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.680]   I think if you've been a Christian for any period of time, you know the frustration of
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.700]   trying to live a life that's pleasing to God.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.940]   I mean, you don't have to be a 20, 30, 40 year Christian.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.300]   You could be a 5 month, 10 month Christian and if you've made any effort, which I believe
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.160]   that every Christian does, if you've made any effort to try to live a life that is pleasing
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.500]   to God, the end result of that is frustration.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.220]   So what ends up happening to a lot of Christians is they end up quitting.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.740]   This is too hard.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.460]   This is too frustrating.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.220]   So many people who've attempted to please God by their own strength, they end up falling
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:23.080]   out or, which is the other part is even more dangerous, they begin to change the doctrines.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.820]   Maybe God doesn't really care that we live a holy life.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:33.020]   In fact, I've actually heard people say, "You can't please God, so don't even try."
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.580]   Even though it's a direct contradiction to the things that we see in Scripture.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.460]   He said he pleased God and that's why he was lifted up.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:46.100]   I think some of you guys can relate to my own experience when I was a young Christian
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.420]   in college.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.860]   I went to Biola not to become a pastor.
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.380]   I went to Biola because I was frustrated in my own faith.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.820]   I thought that if I was surrounding myself with more mature Christians that some of that
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.300]   would rub off on me.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.580]   And then when I went there, it didn't take long for me to realize that they were all
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.660]   in the same boat that I was in.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.660]   They were struggling just as I was.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.340]   And the kind of counsel that I was getting from my older brothers was, "Peter, we're
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.340]   all in the same boat.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.260]   It's frustrating, but if you feel guilty, that's enough.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.100]   Nobody actually pleases God.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.100]   But the fact that you feel guilty, that's the Holy Spirit in you, so if the Holy Spirit
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.980]   is in you, that's enough."
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.260]   And obviously they should have never been counselors.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.440]   But that was the counseling that I was getting.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.260]   And at that point in my spiritual life, it made a lot of sense to me because I didn't
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.980]   see anybody.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.340]   I didn't see anybody that was any different than I was.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.180]   Everybody who loved God with their mouth, but in their life there was no evidence of
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.180]   that.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.500]   And I just began to accept, "Maybe that's true.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.460]   Maybe that's how it actually is as a young Christian."
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:55.500]   Because that was my experience.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:02.820]   I think that our main problem with Christians is we are trying so hard to be better Marthas
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.180]   and it is clear that God is calling us to be better Marys.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:12.860]   Now, those of you who don't know who Martha and Mary is, that makes no sense to you.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.540]   Basically in their account, Martha and Mary are two sisters and Martha is the one who's
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.820]   constantly running around to try to please Jesus, taking care of things, running around.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.260]   And she's frustrated because Mary's just sitting there, soaking up everything that Jesus has
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.340]   to say and she runs to Jesus saying, "Jesus, help me.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.180]   My sister isn't helping out.
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.180]   What's wrong with her?
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.180]   I'm taking care of everything.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.060]   All she's doing is sitting there and just listening to you."
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.180]   And then Jesus turns the table around on her and said, "Martha, Martha, you are worried
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.380]   about so many things, but only one is required of you.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.800]   And Mary has chosen what is best."
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.860]   And all she was doing was soaking up what Jesus had to say to her.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.160]   Because clearly as he says, it is impossible to please God without faith.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.000]   He didn't say it was difficult.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.660]   He didn't say, "You're going to have to try harder.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.860]   You're going to have to be better organized.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.460]   You're going to have to pour more money and find the right people."
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.220]   He says, "No, it is impossible.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.860]   It is not possible to please God without faith.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.900]   No matter how righteous, no matter how holy, no matter how pure we are," he says, "God
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.740]   is not pleased."
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.740]   And there's a reason why so many Christians end up frustrated because we focus so much
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.500]   on what we need to do like Martha and we get frustrated with other people who are not doing
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.700]   what we are doing.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.900]   Yet internally, our love for Christ is never increasing.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.940]   But he said it is faith.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.620]   He says he's referring to Enoch.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.260]   It is faith that caused him to walk with God.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.760]   And it is faith that caused him to walk with God that pleased God.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.260]   And it is faith that caused him to walk with God that pleased God that caused him to be
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.960]   caught up with God.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.060]   So he says it is by faith.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.540]   So what is it about this faith?
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.980]   He says, "He who comes to God must first believe that he is."
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.380]   That's the NASB translation.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.220]   Some of you guys still use the ESV.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.180]   And the ESV says that he who comes to God must first believe that he exists.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.260]   That's how some of your other translations have translated it.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:23.300]   Now let me explain to you why I believe the NASB has the better translation.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.620]   Because that word, if you look at line six, he uses the word "is."
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.380]   He is, he is twice, right?
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.540]   God must believe, he who comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.340]   of those who seek him.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.340]   You see that?
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.740]   He uses the word "is" twice there.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.620]   He is, he is.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.540]   You got that?
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.580]   The first "is" is third person singular of "a me."
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.500]   The second one, I'm not going to get into the Greek because it doesn't matter, but it's
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.980]   not the same word.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.580]   He uses the same "he is, he is," and yet the word "is" in that same line is two different
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.580]   words.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.580]   Why?
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:08.420]   I believe the reason why is because what he is saying in the beginning has deep theological
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.780]   implication.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:16.180]   He's not simply saying that he who comes to God must first believe that he exists.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.340]   Because we're not talking to an atheist society.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.420]   At that time, everybody was polytheist.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.700]   They believed that the rock was God, the sun was God, the moon was God, the earth was God.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.820]   In fact, they accused Christians of being atheists because they were monotheists.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.980]   They only believed in one God, and so that was so strange to them, they actually called
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.140]   them atheists.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.260]   So he's not talking to anybody who believes that there isn't a God.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.980]   So he's not saying if you want to first come to God, you must first move from an atheist
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.980]   to be a theist.
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.980]   That's not what he is saying.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:55.300]   See, the third person singular of Amy, if the first person is what?
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.700]   I am.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:05.860]   So I believe what he is saying is he who first comes to God must believe that he is.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.020]   Now what is he referring to?
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.700]   Well, if you look at the Gospel of John, that's the whole point of the Gospel of John.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.380]   The seven "I am" statements of Jesus, where Jesus is correcting the false hope and false
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.140]   desires of the Jews.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:27.340]   First of the "I am" statements, chapter 6 of John, "I am the bread of life."
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.460]   He's talking to people who wanted to forcefully make Jesus king because Jesus was healing
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.220]   them and giving them bread.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.660]   And Jesus points out to them and says, "You're coming to me not because you know who I am,
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.900]   but because you ate and you want more."
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.260]   And it's in that context that Jesus says, "The bread that you get from this world will
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.460]   make you hungry again, but the bread that I give to you will rise up in eternal life."
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.820]   And he says, "I am the bread of life."
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.100]   He says in John chapter 8, "I am the light of the world."
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.140]   This is in the context of celebrating the Feast of Booths.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.940]   And during the Feast of Booths, they were celebrating the 40 years of wandering in the
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:11.180]   desert and they would set up lights at the temple to remind the nation of Israel how
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.620]   God led them and they believed that one day that the Messiah was going to come, a leader
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:21.420]   was going to come and lead them into a better country.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.740]   Jesus in that context says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:32.060]   In John chapter 10, he says, "I am the door of the sheep."
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:38.300]   He's saying this right after healing the blind man in chapter 9 and people were living in
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:43.660]   fear of the leaders of the synagogue because he said to the blind man, "If you give credit
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.460]   to Jesus, you will be cast out of the synagogue."
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.620]   To be cast out of the synagogue means you may not be able to get married.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.340]   You may not be able to do your business.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.780]   Whatever standing that you have in society, God's going to shun you.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.340]   You're going to have to live outside the camp.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:05.820]   So imagine a blind man who was forced to beg all of his life, opens his eyes, meaning that
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.980]   he can now enter back into the regular society and the leaders are telling him, "If you do
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.100]   not turn against Jesus, you cannot enter."
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.300]   And out of fear, even his parents refuse to stand with him.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.300]   I'm not going to answer.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.300]   You ask him yourself.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.580]   The blind man stands up and he gets kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.060]   It is in that context that Jesus says, "I am the door."
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.300]   You're so afraid of being kicked out of the synagogue door, he says, "I am the door."
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.020]   And that's why directly connected to that in John chapter 10 and 11, he says, "I am
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.820]   the good shepherd."
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.580]   Because they were in such fear of submitting to these leaders because if you don't submit
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.860]   to them, he's going to kick them out.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:53.540]   You can't have the life that you desired, what you coveted, if you don't submit to their
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.540]   leadership.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.420]   And it is in that context that Jesus says, "No, I am the good shepherd."
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.820]   These false prophets, they come to devour you.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.380]   You're so concerned about their approval that they have not come to give you life.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.260]   I have come to give you this life.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.900]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:17.180]   In John chapter 11, Lazarus, a good friend of Jesus' ministry, he's about to die and
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.580]   they beg Jesus to come.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.020]   He takes his time in allowing this to happen.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.720]   And as he is going to the grave to resurrect him, Jesus says, "I'm going to resurrect him,
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.620]   but I want you to know I am the resurrection and life."
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.860]   Whether Lazarus lives a long life or short life, even if he is resuscitated for a period
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.860]   of time, he will die again.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.340]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:49.620]   He says in John chapter 14, verse 6, "I am the truth, I am the way, and I am the life."
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.500]   He's saying this because he is about to leave his disciples.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.940]   And they, right up to that point, they just did whatever Jesus did.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.500]   If he goes to Galilee, we're going to go to Galilee.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.380]   If we go to Jerusalem, we go to Jerusalem.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.560]   If he gets on a boat, we get on a boat.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.940]   And Jesus just told them, "I'm going to leave, and where I go, you cannot come."
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.740]   And so he's reminding his disciples, "I am the way, I am the truth, I am the life."
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:18.100]   And then that's why he ends John chapter 15, verse 1, as he is preparing to go, he says,
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.620]   "I am the true vine.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.000]   You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me, unless you continue in me.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.460]   Even though I will leave, your life is going to be continually dependent upon you continuing
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.060]   and remaining in me.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.980]   I am the true vine."
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:41.820]   And every one of these statements is to cut into the temptation that every one of us has.
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:48.340]   That I am your basic need, I am your hope, I am the one who guards the door to life.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.140]   I am the true leader, the true shepherd.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.780]   I am your eternal life.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.180]   I am your purpose and direction, and I am the one who will sustain you and cause you
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.100]   to be fruitful.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.580]   And that's what all the seven "I am" statements are about.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.660]   I am.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.220]   Not I will be, not I will point you to, not I am the source of.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.120]   He says, "I am."
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.540]   So I believe that the author here is saying that he who comes to God must first believe
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.440]   that he is.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:26.980]   Because if we live our life to try to appease him, to please him by our efforts, we're going
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.100]   against everything in our flesh.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.960]   We want the world, but we're going to fight against it.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.420]   We find pleasure in the things that the world has to offer, but we're going to fight against
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.420]   it.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:45.900]   And a lot of people in the church live their Christian life constantly trying to resist
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.220]   all the temptations in our heart.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.420]   No wonder it's frustrating.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.380]   It's just like a man who's hungry constantly walking around the buffet, "I'm not going
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.380]   to eat today.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.380]   I'm not going to eat today.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.420]   I'm not going to eat today."
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.740]   And that's what Christian life feels like for a lot of people.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.740]   My heart desires it.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   My eyes want it.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.760]   I covet it every single day, and I feel this pressure in me constantly.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.700]   And I come to church, and all I do is feel guilty.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.180]   And I'm going to try harder this time.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.420]   I'm going to try harder this time.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.460]   You know what he is saying?
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.820]   You cannot please God in that way.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:26.180]   Your flesh is going to win until there is a transformation in our heart of what ultimately,
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.720]   truly brings pleasure.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:37.220]   That's what transformation does in our heart, where we find life in Christ more than this
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.580]   world.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:44.040]   So until we genuinely believe that He is, we're not going to walk with Him.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.080]   Our feet are going to take us to whatever we're tempted by, even though our mind and
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.700]   what we hear is telling us to go the other direction.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.940]   What he is saying is, you have to do about faith.
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.660]   You have to know who He is.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.660]   That's why Martha is going around doing all this stuff, and he says, "No, Mary has chosen
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.620]   what is best," because until there is a transformation of seeing the glory of the gospel of Jesus
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.940]   Christ, everything else is just determination.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.860]   Our determination is not going to get us closer to God.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.380]   There has to be an illumination.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.060]   That's why he says, "Without faith."
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:23.980]   You must first believe that He is, because believing is what leads us to seeking.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.340]   Let me say that again.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.080]   Believing is what leads us to seeking.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:37.700]   If you find life in the world, of course your flesh is eventually going to go there.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.780]   But if you find life in Christ, and that's where we find the greatest pleasure.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.140]   He's my hope.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.620]   He's my sustenance.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.260]   He's my life.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.740]   He's my refuge.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:54.580]   So my heart, my life, my legs are eventually going to cause me to seek after the things
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.140]   that I believe is going to give me what I desire.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.780]   But if my desire is for the world, and my doctrine is for Christ, no wonder there's
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.700]   this tension that causes us to be constantly frustrated.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.020]   That's why he says, "It is impossible to please God without faith."
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:15.580]   He who comes to God must believe that He is.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.580]   He is.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.020]   Do you believe that?
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.480]   Before we worry about discipleship, before we worry about discipline, before we worry
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:30.460]   about doing all of these things and what other people are doing, do you believe that He is?
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.100]   Do you believe that?
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:39.620]   Because if you can't say adamantly, "I believe that," everything else you do outside of that
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.060]   is going to be frustrating.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.740]   It's just going to be leading to more frustration.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.860]   Enoch pleased God because he believed.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:56.620]   Secondly, by faith Enoch pleased God by walking with God.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.580]   By faith Enoch pleased God by walking with God.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.740]   There's not a lot said about Enoch, right?
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.780]   And we're going to get that, "Well, how's he going to milk this?"
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:11.260]   From two words, verse 22, Genesis 5, "Enoch walked with God."
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.820]   Verse 24, "Enoch walked with God and he was not, for God took him."
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.820]   That's it.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:21.860]   In fact, in verse 5 it says, "By faith Enoch was taken up."
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:26.380]   Literally, "taken up" in your King James Version, if you guys are using that, it just says, "He
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.020]   was translated."
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.660]   What does that even mean?
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.820]   The word simply means he was here and then now he came over here.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.320]   That's all that means.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.020]   So they interpret it by saying, "Oh, he meant he was taken up to God."
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.940]   But the word just means he was here and then he was removed.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.500]   But we know that he was taken up to God because it says he didn't taste death.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.760]   So that's our image of him just going to God.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.740]   But literally he was just moved.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:57.380]   I mean, what an anticlimactic way of saying, "He didn't die.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.380]   He went to God!"
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.140]   He said, "No, he just moved."
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.000]   That's how it's written.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.460]   What is it about him walking with God that he is named among the Hall of Fame with Abraham
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.460]   and Noah?
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.720]   Well, in Amos chapter 3, verse 3 it says, "Do two men walk together unless they have
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.960]   made an appointment?"
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.280]   Well, "appointment" just simply means an agreement.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.120]   He says, in other words, two people can't walk together unless there is an agreement.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.240]   So if I'm going to make an appointment, an agreement, we have to agree that we're going
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.620]   to make this time, we're going to meet at this place for this purpose.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.620]   That's what it means.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.720]   When two people marry, there's an agreement, there's a covenant that they enter.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:44.440]   So he's saying that when Enoch walked with God, there was an agreement.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.940]   Because a sinner can't just simply say, "Hey, I want to talk to you."
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:55.560]   So even though it is simple, elementary words, in those words there was a reconciliation
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.480]   with God, with Enoch, and he walked with God.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   There was an agreement.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.440]   Well, in the New Testament version of that, Jesus says the same thing.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.240]   In Luke chapter 9, 20-24, and he was saying to them, "If anyone wishes to come after
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.960]   me," "come after me" is just another way of saying he wants to walk with me.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.640]   He wants to come to where I am.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:24.000]   He says, "He must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.140]   For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake,
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.080]   he is the one who will save it."
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.640]   In other words, this is an agreement.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   You can't walk with me, you can't have an appointment with me, you can't live with me
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.920]   until there is an agreement, and this is the agreement contract.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.180]   If you want to walk with me, you must pick up your own cross and deny yourself.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.340]   You can come to church, but you're not walking with God.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.040]   You can be an evangelist and tell people, but you're not walking with God until there
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.880]   is an agreement, until there is a reconciliation.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.640]   And Jesus says that this is the requirement, and that's what he's saying.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.880]   When he walked with God, that he had fellowship with him because there was an agreement of
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.320]   reconciliation.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.680]   There's something else about Enoch that we can easily miss.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:25.740]   In Jude 14 and 15, any of you who've ever studied Jude, Jude is a difficult letter to
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.640]   understand because it has a lot of spiritual, demonic, and angiology that's mixed in with
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.640]   all this stuff.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.040]   Well, it is in that book that Enoch is mentioned.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.360]   In two verses, and this is what it says about Enoch.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.960]   It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied,
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.920]   saying, "Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment upon
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:53.320]   all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds, which they have done
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.840]   in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.840]   him."
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.960]   Do you notice how many times he says "ungodly"?
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.920]   They're trying to make a point.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:10.080]   "Ungodly, all the ungodly, godly, ungodly, ungodly."
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   So if you read that, you know that that's being emphasized.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.800]   It was that bad.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.440]   It says Enoch was basically warning.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.520]   And so what he was saying at that time, it resonates as prophetic to the time that the
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.880]   person is writing about in Jude.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.600]   Now what's interesting is, if you go to the next slide, this is a chart of the life of
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.720]   the patriarchs that are mentioned in Genesis chapter 5.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:42.000]   You notice Enoch is about halfway or to the lower part, and obviously his lifeline is
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.480]   not as long as the others, right?
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.480]   Because he was taken up.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.520]   He didn't live a long life, or a long life at their standard, right?
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.720]   365 days was his life, where others lived 900 and some.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:01.440]   But you notice something unique about Enoch's life?
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:07.680]   When Enoch was living, all the other patriarchs were still alive.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   Adam was still alive.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.680]   Seth was alive.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:15.120]   Enosh, Kenan, Mahalal, Jared, they're all still alive.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.280]   During his lifetime, because they lived such a long time.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.640]   So they had kids when they were young, and then they lived another hundreds and hundreds
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.680]   of years.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:29.320]   So if you look at their timeline of their life, Enoch knew his grandfather, great-grandfather,
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:34.280]   great-great-grandfather, great-great-great-grandfather, and all the way up to Adam.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.200]   Now what's interesting about all of this is that Genesis chapter 6 is when the flood comes
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.820]   in.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:47.160]   And this is how, before the flood comes in, how God describes mankind.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:53.280]   Genesis chapter 6, "And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth."
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.160]   It was great on the earth.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.880]   Notice the same thing he said?
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.360]   Godly, ungodly, ungodly.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.960]   The ungodliness was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.800]   was only evil continually.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.320]   So you know what that means?
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.160]   Enoch was the first evangelist.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:17.360]   Enoch was the first prophet who was prophesying against the multiplying sinfulness of mankind,
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:24.960]   and he stood against the tide, and he preached to them the warning of the judgment of God.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:31.880]   I mean, imagine how hard it is to be a Christian if you are a minority.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.440]   Imagine how difficult it is when you're by yourself.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.680]   You know, when I was young, I used to ask myself that question.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.920]   If I didn't live in a Christian community, if I didn't have friends in church, if my
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.440]   family wasn't Christian, if I was the only Christian that I knew, would I still follow
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.440]   Christ?
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.520]   Do I believe in him enough to go against the tide of everybody around me?
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.640]   If I was the only businessman, if I was the only doctor, if I was the only nurse, if I
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.200]   was the only student, would I still follow Christ?
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.320]   Well, I can't answer that question because that never happened to me.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.760]   I've always been around Christians.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.160]   I've always been encouraged.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.600]   I've had books.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.560]   I've had videos, conferences.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.880]   I don't know how to answer that question because that's never happened.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:24.360]   Enoch stood in darkness, and he was preaching.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.880]   He was the first evangelist.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:31.720]   He was the first prophet who was warning them that if this continues, judgment is coming.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.320]   In chapter 6, it comes.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:42.240]   Third and finally, by faith, Enoch pleased God and lived.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:48.160]   You know, if you look at Genesis chapter 5, it gives the timeline of the patriarch, how
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.160]   long they lived.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.520]   It says in Genesis 5, 5, so all the days that Adam lived were 930 years.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.600]   Nine hundred and thirty years.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.880]   Is it the record that we have in Guinness Book of World Record?
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.280]   The oldest person that has ever lived that we have on record is 122 years and 164 days.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:10.600]   Janine Calmart, she was born in 1875 and died in 1997.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   That's the record that we have.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.640]   I mean, she's an infant compared to these people.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.840]   They lived 930 years.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.160]   It's in verse 8.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.440]   Seth lived 912 years.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.880]   Genesis 5, 11.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.640]   Enoch were 905 years.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.320]   That's not Enoch, Enoch.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.920]   Verse 14, Canaan were 910 years.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:39.720]   Verse 17, Mahalel were 195 years, and Jared were 962 years.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.040]   Now we may look at that and we get caught up.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.760]   Man, how could they live that long?
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   Nine hundred years?
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.760]   Is that even possible?
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.760]   And we get caught up with these numbers of how long they lived.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.160]   But you missed the whole point of Genesis chapter 5 because Genesis chapter 5 isn't
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.720]   about how long they lived.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:02.880]   Genesis chapter 5, theologians call this the graveyard chapter of the Bible.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.480]   Because the point wasn't that they lived long.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   The point was that each one of them died.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   Let's read that again.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   Genesis 5, 5.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.600]   So all the days of Adam lived were 930 years and he died.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   Genesis 5, 8.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.280]   So all the days of Seth were 912 years and he died.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.280]   Genesis 5, 11.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.800]   So all the days of Enoch were 905 years and he died.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.040]   Genesis 5, 14.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.600]   So all the days of Canaan were 910 years and he died.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   Genesis 5, 17.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:37.640]   So all the days of Mahalel were 895 years and he died.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.720]   Genesis 5, 20.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.560]   So all the days of Jared were 962 years and he died.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.880]   And over and over again.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.880]   He said he died.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.880]   He died.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.880]   He died.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.880]   He died.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.880]   He died.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.880]   He died.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   That was the point of Genesis chapter 5.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.320]   God said, "If you eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall surely
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.840]   die."
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:00.360]   And Genesis chapter 5 is a record of the death of mankind.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.080]   And it is in this record that Enoch stands out because of his faith.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   He walked with God.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.160]   He pleased God.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   And God caused him to live.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.440]   And we naturally ask the question, "Why did he get to go up?
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.440]   Why did he go up?"
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:28.520]   We may ask ourselves, but the real question that we ask is, "Why didn't we?"
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.720]   Because he said he saved us.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.040]   We have eternal life because we believe him.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.340]   And why are we here?
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.680]   Why didn't we get lifted up with Enoch?
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:47.480]   If our eternal life is here, if the rest of our Christian life is meant to be this struggle,
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:53.060]   and there is this constant struggle, struggle with friendship, struggle with community,
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.460]   struggle with our children, struggle with our marriages, struggle with the temptation
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:04.380]   of the world, struggle with drifting, struggle with politics, struggle with economics, it
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.380]   would be better.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:13.260]   I mean, I wonder all the time, like, "Why do people want to live such long lives here?
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.160]   What's so good about here?
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.700]   Every good thing that I desire turns out to be bad for me.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.500]   Why do I want to be here?
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.080]   I'd rather be in eternity.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.460]   So why did he leave me here?
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.540]   Why did he leave you here?
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.820]   Why weren't we caught up like Enoch?"
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:36.900]   Well, the answer is pretty clear.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:42.300]   In 2 Peter 3.9, people were asking that question, "When's he coming?
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.300]   When's he coming?"
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:49.060]   And Peter answered, "The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness,
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:58.100]   but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance."
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:03.740]   God did not leave us here so that we can enjoy heaven before we get to heaven.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.500]   God left us here as a witness to make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.580]   name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:15.700]   He wanted us to be the aroma of Christ wherever we go, that we ought to be the light and the
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.260]   salt of this earth.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.840]   What good is salt if it loses its flavor other than to be put underground and be trampled
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.380]   by men?
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:29.780]   And repeatedly, over and over again, he said he left us for a specific purpose, to be a
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.700]   light in this dark world.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:37.980]   Otherwise, there is no reason to be here.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:43.820]   Some of us are trying so hard to clean up a burned-down house.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.540]   The Bible already said, "Mankind is under condemnation."
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.940]   All has been under judgment.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:55.460]   And we're trying so hard to make heaven and earth on this place, and it's no different
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.060]   than going into a burned-down house and putting new carpet in.
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.060]   The house is already condemned.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:09.820]   So all our efforts to make our life better, at the end of the day, is vanity, vanity,
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.820]   all is vanity.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:16.300]   And until you and I come to that conclusion, and we live our life, whether it is as a doctor,
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.540]   whether it is as a lawyer, as a businessman, or as a student, if our life, that we live
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.500]   here, isn't for the purpose of bringing God the glory, it is vanity, vanity, all is vanity.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:31.140]   No matter how much money you make, no matter how nice of a house, no matter how long and
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:39.180]   healthy, even all the investments that you make, get 10,000 percent profit, all is vanity.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.420]   Because the only reason why you and I are here, until he comes, is so that you and I
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.460]   can be a light.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.380]   Right now, persecution is coming.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.780]   If you're spiritually sober, I know that you agree with me, it's coming.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.940]   It's already here.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.260]   But persecution is not a bad thing for the church.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.620]   Persecution basically is God turning the light down.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:09.260]   There's reasons why we drive long distances to go up to the mountains and to the countryside
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.340]   so that we can have a better look at the stars.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.940]   Because while we're here with all the man-made lights, it's a distraction.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:21.820]   So we get away from the light so that we can have a clearer view of the stars.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.620]   When persecution comes, the light gets turned off.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.100]   And it is time for Christians to shine.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:35.420]   This is the time where we stand and say, in the midst of darkness, that hope is found
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.020]   in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:46.980]   So I pray, as you and I know what is coming, that we will not be caught off like the rest
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:52.500]   of the world, and hoping that the boat that we got on just kind of casually drifts toward
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.300]   Christ, because it does not.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:02.060]   That we would put on the armor of God, knowing that we do not fight against flesh and blood.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:07.780]   That we would put on the gear and be ready to shine Christ.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.700]   That's why we're here.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.220]   Enoch is given to us as an example.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:18.260]   By faith, we walk, please God, and he lived.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.580]   That even when we die, we will live in Christ.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.740]   Do you believe that?
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.860]   Because without faith, it is impossible to please him.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:32.740]   So I pray that, again, as our community, as our generation, as the politics and all that
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:38.820]   is around us becomes darker and darker, that we will see more opportunities to shine Christ.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:45.020]   Let's pray.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:51.420]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your continued guidance and blessing, especially, Lord God,
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:55.940]   as the world becomes darker and darker.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.540]   Help us, Lord God, that our love would not grow cold.
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:05.860]   Lord, we pray that you will bring revival into your church.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:10.740]   That we would not live in fear because of certain laws that will be passed.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.260]   In fear, Lord God, that we would not be able to attain the things that we've coveted in
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.140]   our hearts.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.860]   Help us, Lord God, to increase in our faith.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:28.160]   That we would profess with stronger and stronger faith that Christ is.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.860]   That he is our sustenance, he is our hope, he is our leader, he is our refuge, he is
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.260]   our guide, he is our source of life.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.060]   That he is the true vine.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.500]   So for that end, I pray that you would strengthen your church, that you would keep us sober,
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.100]   open our eyes to see the opportunities that you are creating for us.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.820]   That we may shine Christ and shine him bright.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
