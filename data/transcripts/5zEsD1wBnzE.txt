[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   We will now begin our service.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]

[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Jesus, you're the sweetest.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Jesus, you're the sweetest name of all.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Jesus, you always hear me when I call.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Oh, Jesus, you pick me up each time I fall.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Jesus, you're the sweetest.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Jesus, you're the sweetest name of all.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Jesus, you always hear me when I call.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Oh, Jesus, you pick me up each time I fall.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Jesus, how I love.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Jesus, how I love to praise your name.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Jesus, you're still the first, the last, the same.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Oh, Jesus, you died and took away my shame.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Jesus, you're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Jesus, you're the soon and coming king.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Jesus, we need the love that you bring.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Oh, Jesus, we lift our voices up and sing.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   I want to extend a warm welcome to all of you.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   If you're visiting us for the very first time, please do stop
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   by our welcome booth that is located just right at the
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   entrance of the parking lot.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   We'd love to connect with you and just provide any information
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and answer any questions that you may have.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   When you entered into the sanctuary today, there's this
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   card on your chair.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Please do use this as first opportunity to share with
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   people in your life.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   You know, perhaps you have a co-worker you're going to go out
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   to lunch with.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Just keep it in your car or something and give that to him
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   or her as a means to just remind us of the things that are
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   happening this week.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   It's an occasion where we're specifically remembering the
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   sacrifice and resurrection of our Lord.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   So an opportune time to make an invitation.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Also, our outreach team is continuing to want to join you
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   in prayer.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   So if you have specific people you're lifting up on our
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Facebook site and our app, there's a link for submissions
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   so that you can submit someone's name and then that way we can
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   pray alongside you.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Also, at the very least, this will be like a reminder card
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   for you for the things that are happening this week because
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   there's quite a bit.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Again, please note that from Monday through Thursday, there
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   are devotions that will be live streamed and we're going to
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   open up the sanctuary for people to come.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And then Friday, that's going to be Good Friday service with
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   communion and all the things happening Monday through Friday
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   at 730 p.m.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   The early rise service is going to be outside in the courtyard.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Please make sure you come prepared for that.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   It's going to be a little chilly.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   That service will not be live streamed, but we will have our
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   9 o'clock and 11 o'clock regular services for Easter service that
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   day and that will be live streamed.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   More details will continue to be kind of sent out and posted as
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   reminders for us as that week approaches.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Another announcement I'd like to highlight is we have our
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   membership class that will start April 18th.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And again, that class runs for eight weeks from 9 a.m.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   to 1030 a.m. in the Upper Room Cafe.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And that class is designed specifically for people desiring
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   to enter into membership, going through the important doctrines
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   of the church and how that translates into and that's why
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   we do church this way.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   So a very important class.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Make sure you sign up.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   The link is there again on the Facebook and the app as well.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Lastly, I just want to mention that so after our worship set,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   our brother Mark will come up after the worship set to give
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   his testimony and he'll be baptized.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   At this time, let's bow our head in a word of prayer as we take
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   time to give our offering.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Our Father, we thank you for this day and God,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   our hearts are grateful to you.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Lord, you have granted to us all things in life.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   God, every single practical thing, tangible thing that you
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   have granted to us, we know we receive from your grace.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   But what's more, we're so grateful that we have from you
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   all riches and eternity.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Lord, God, we have an eternity with you to receive your grace,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   to know you, to worship you and to serve you.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   We recognize that that is valuable beyond anything we can
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   even begin to quantify.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And so we thank you and lift this time up to you.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   We want to lift up our worship, our praise, the attention,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   our affection, all of it, Lord, to you during this time.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And right now as we give to you our offering, we pray,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Father God, that you will continue to bless the ministry here.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Lord, would you continue to use everything that we give in terms
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   of service and time and our finances to further your cause
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   of spreading your gospel and doing the work of ministry.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Amen.

[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   [silence]
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Hi there. My name is Mark, and many of you may not know me,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   but that's okay because I've only been coming to Berean for a few months now.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And so today I have the privilege of sharing my testimony.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   So I was actually raised up in the church by my parents,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   and growing up I never really liked it or felt passionate about it.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   It was something that felt like more of my parents' faith and not mine.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And so as I grew up, I actually slowly started to despise it.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   But as I got older, I started having thoughts like,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   "Why do I have to follow all these rules that don't apply to most people?"
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And as I got--sometimes I even felt like I was an outsider at school,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   but I just chose to ignore this feeling because I just tried to fit in.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   So actually, because I was raised up in the church, it's always made me recognize
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   how there is a God, yet I chose to just ignore Him
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   because I didn't want to feel guilty about any of my sins.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   It seemed like a burden having to repent when I know that I'm just going to be
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   making the same mistakes or sinning again in the future.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And so I chose to just ignore Him. I forgot about Him.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And sometimes I even twisted what God meant to me
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   so that I can use Him to serve myself instead of serving Him.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   And for a majority of my life, I've continued to think this way.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   But recently this summer, God actually made me realize just how sinful this world is
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and also how I am just so much like it.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   All I cared about was myself and what made me happy.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   So last semester when I was dorming at Cal State Long Beach,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I wasn't attending any churches because quite honestly, I didn't feel like it.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I wondered what it was like having an entire day of the weekend all to myself.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Again, as you can see, my selfishness.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   But thinking about it now, I realized that God was working in my life to bring me to Berean.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Berean caught my eye with the realization of just how much there was to learn about God
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   and honestly also just how welcoming everyone was.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   At first, this welcoming of the large ministry that I'm not used to
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   was what kept me attracted to Berean and I kept coming because of it.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   But as I kept coming, I learned more about God and His Word.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And ultimately, I also just realized how short my understanding was in Christianity.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Before all of this, I actually thought that I was already saved
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   because I knew that God died for me on the cross as a mere fact.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   But what I didn't know was like I didn't live my life as if He was actually my Lord.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   And so God made me realize just how great my sins were against Him
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   and how Jesus is actually the only one who's able to save me.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So just as it is written in Ephesians 2:8,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   It is the gift of God.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   He's shown me grace by giving me a new heart and making me alive
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   so that I can now follow and love Him by faith.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   He's made me recognize what He's done for me and just how grateful I should be because of it.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Now it's all about living a life that's glorifying to the Lord
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   and having my own relationship with Him.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Without Him, I'd still be just as dead in my sin and an enemy of God.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   But because He opened my heart--or opened my eyes and gave me a new heart,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   I now no longer desire to follow the world, but I follow Jesus as my Lord and Savior."
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   [applause]
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   [water pouring]
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   >> Mark, thanks for sharing your testimony with us.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Mark, do you understand that by entering into the water,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   you're expressing your union with Christ and His death,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   and that by coming out of the water, you're expressing your union with Christ and His resurrected life?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   >> I do.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   >> And I baptize you in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   [water pouring]
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   [silence]
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   >> It's always so blessed to hear the testimony of a young man
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   recognizing his state before the Lord and coming to faith.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Today we're going to be continuing to learn about how powerful that faith is.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Over the last--in the course of the many weeks,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   we've been walking through the book of Hebrews
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   and specifically going methodically through chapter 11 on what is faith.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And it has been so good to meditate on how powerful, truly powerful that faith is.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Now, the faith that we exercise is so incredibly powerful,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   not because it's a powerful key, as some would say,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   as though this is a special key you use to turn certain things on or off.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   It's not powerful because through it you end up making giant leaps and bounds.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   But Scripture tells us faith is powerful because what God gives to us in the faith
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   is to be able to see what is reality, what is truth.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And the greatest truth that ever existed is the truth of God, that this is who God is.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   And by knowing him and seeing him as he is, then you now have light to everything else.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   You have the light of truth to show you yourself in relationship to this God.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   You have faith to see what the world really is.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   You have faith to see how things fit into the grand scheme as God has made things, and so on.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   So as opposed to, let's say, what is perhaps a popular way of thinking about faith
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   is just like this leap into the darkness or leap across a bridge.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   No, no, faith is actually you being able to see God for who he is.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And that's why it's so powerful.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And it causes us then to say, "God, I need you. I want you."
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   We've been learning about how Jacob, in seeing God's promise, then sees it for what it is
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   and so therefore values it above everything else and pursues it with everything he has, right,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   by being able to see.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And so today we're going to be talking about that in the book of Matthew chapter 15.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   So please take a moment to turn there.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   We're looking at kind of an interesting story and learning from an unexpected individual character
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   about what it means to have humble faith, a faith that is strong, a faith that is powerful,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   because it helps us to see reality for what it is.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   So let's take a moment to read this passage.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And the word says, "Jesus went from there and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And a Canaanite woman from the region came out and began to cry out, saying,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   'Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David. My daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.'
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   But he did not answer her a word.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And his disciples came and implored him, saying, 'Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us.'
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   But he answered and said, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   But she came and began to bow down before him, saying, 'Lord, help me.'
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   And he answered and said, 'It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.'
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   But she said, 'Yes, Lord, but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their master's table.'
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Then Jesus said to her, 'O woman, your faith is great. It shall be done for you as you wish.'
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And her daughter was healed at once."
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your truth.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And God, we eagerly desire to keep growing in our faith.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   In the way that we see you, Lord, that God, it would become more and more accurate and detailed.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And by doing so, God, I pray we're not just simply learning intellectual facts,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   but God, our hearts and eyes are being changed.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And Lord, it is to our blessedness, it is to our grace,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   that God, we're able to see you and know you in greater intimacy.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   So we thank you, Lord. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Okay.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   So as we take a look at this passage,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   because we have to kind of jump down into the scene, you know.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   It's Matthew 15, and Jesus has already been doing the work of ministry,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   of teaching of the kingdom, healing, right?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Discipling the group that he has, the 12 disciples,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   and making sure that they're being prepared.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And what ends up happening is as Jesus is withdrawing,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   so from the crowds he's trying to actually get away, okay?
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   He's withdrawing into an arena, and the story already should,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   if you were like a Jew listening to the story, already be like, "Oh no."
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Because he's entering into a region where it is all Gentile, right?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And according to the customs, so to speak, of the day, you just don't mix.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And what's more, those specific cities, Tyre and Sinai,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   they are Canaanite cities of which you could see them as like arch nemesis,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   you know, that kind of stuff.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   The Canaanite people, they were destroyed by the Israelites.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   So Canaanite people were like, "Oh, welcome, friends."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Like they wouldn't be receiving them in that fashion anyway.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Already there was cultural divide. Already there was animosity.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   The history is against them, so to speak.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   So if you're reading Jesus and the disciples are entering into this region,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   already you should be thinking, "Oh, that's a no-no."
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   But what's happened here is the story describes then this Canaanite woman,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   so her lineage is Canaanite, but she is Syrophoenician,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   meaning she's from this area, she's Greek by culture.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Then most likely her upbringing, her language, her religion, all that stuff,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   is Greek, pantheons, and et cetera, et cetera, right?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   But what's interesting is as we jump down into this scenario then
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   is you have an unlikely individual who is unlikely going to approach
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   a possible entourage of a high, I guess, profile celebrity, if you will,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   because news about him is spreading everywhere.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   And you have basically 13 Jewish men trying to go in a secluded region
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   so that they can have time to prepare and et cetera,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   maybe even have a respite from the ministry that they're doing.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And this woman comes, desperate.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   This woman comes with cries, with screams and shouts.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   And we quickly learn she says that her daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Originally for some reason I thought every time I think about a demon-possessed person,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   it's some adult who is out of control, angry, right?
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Destructive and violent, because that's a lot of times the way the Scriptures has these accounts.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   But the Gospel of Mark adds the detail that this was a child, it was a little daughter.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   And then part of you goes, "Demons," right?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Tormenting even little ones.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   But at the same time we jump into her desperation and we quickly recognize
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   sometimes there's a kind of suffering that goes beyond your own pains.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   This is a kind of desperation where it's for her little baby girl, right?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And I quickly, as I thought about this, I remembered our first son, Josiah,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   when he was two, he's now turning 10, but when he was two
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   we had this incredibly desperate moment where I genuinely felt desperate.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And it was he had this high fever that spiked rapidly.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   It went up to about 105, and then he walked into a seizure.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   His knuckles curled up, his eyes rolled back, his face turned blue, his lips turned blue.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   And Bia held and looked at me and said, "He's not breathing!"
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   I panicked. I started running like back and forth.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Like I don't know why I ran to the door.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   I opened it, I ran back, I looked at her, grabbed the bag.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Because what am I supposed to do?
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   If your child's not breathing, what are you supposed to do?
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   A lot of you guys who know me, you know I have horrendous memory.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   I can't even remember what I did yesterday.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   But those moments of desperation, it's seared into your brain.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I can tell you how I felt, where I ran to, what I grabbed, how I drove, all of that.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Because sometimes in the moments of desperation, especially here,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   it's kind of inexplicable what you're going to end up doing.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And so maybe we can kind of more humanistically relate to her and say, "We get you."
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   "We get you that you're suffering here."
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And this is the kind of suffering that's not like you hurt yourself,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   but a kind of suffering where it truly makes you feel desperate
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   because you know the limitations that you have even as a parent.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   You're going to protect your children, but you know your shield is only so big.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   And clearly you're out of your own element here.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   What are you going to do?
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Of course you're going to go cry out, right?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   But here's the thing.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   I think falsely we believe that suffering somehow refines and humbles us and grows us.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   No.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   That's not true.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   I think my own experience in life teaches me that when you're hurt or you go through suffering,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   you end up becoming more scabby, somehow hardened.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   The natural human being, when faced with difficulty, hardship, and suffering,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   they typically turn to things like anger.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   What I've seen just trying to help people overcome their suffering and hardships, sadly to say,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   is that there's a hardening of the heart.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   What we're actually required to walk through suffering is faith.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   And that's why it was such a--when I said earlier that faith is powerful,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   it not only overcomes the scenario and the suffering,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   it overcomes the crustiness of your heart in that suffering.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   The natural inclination for man is not to come out of suffering greater in benevolence,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   greater in modesty, greater in humility.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   No.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Walk with anybody through suffering.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Walk with anybody who's felt like their back was up against the wall.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   They've already tried everything that was in their power.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   It doesn't just naturally cause humility.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Humility comes by faith, amen, the work that God is doing in our hearts.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   And so the first thing I want to highlight as we see this narrative
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   is that humble faith in the midst of desperation requests mercy.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   What I mean by that is this woman's faith as we exhibit it in the midst of her desperation
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   is leading her to a humble posture of asking.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Because what I said just a moment ago is that actually if you,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   through experience of counseling or even just experiencing your own life,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   your temptation in the moment of suffering is rage.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   You feel justified to rage.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   You feel justified to let it loose.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And then sometimes not only do you feel justified, you compete with people.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Do you have any idea the suffering I went through?
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Here any of the stereotypical grouchy older people kind of mentality,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   I feel like, again, I feel blessed to have lived this life that I've lived,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   but having been, yes, an immigrant, having been, you know, through hardships,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   seeing my parents and having hardships of divorce or my parents going through divorce,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   et cetera, et cetera, and all of that, I feel the temptation to be like,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   "Dude, my life is this, this, and this.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Don't you dare even tell me about your suffering."
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Because that's what the natural heart does in the midst of hardship.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   But what I'm trying to tell you is this woman is already being expressed.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   You might say like, "What an obvious point to make.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   She asks the question.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Like what kind of point is that?"
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   But that's a point because what I'm trying to say is every one of us are tempted
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   in the moments of suffering to flee, flight.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Second is to fight.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   But in the desperation, if it's met with a heart of faith,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   then she is going to ask and request.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   So if you look at the narrative here, it comes where she's crying out to the Lord Jesus,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   and what does she say?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Even her words are already humble, is it not?
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Look at verse 22.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   "This Canaanite woman from the region came out and began to cry out, saying,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   'Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David!'"
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   She implores him and desires that he would give her that grace and mercy.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   And that level of desperation, it didn't produce what is natural to the human heart,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   but rather it produced this beseeching.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And I got to say, honestly speaking, if you meditate on that a little bit,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   being in a posture or if you're ever required, like by necessity,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   you're put into a position where you have to ask, it's humbling in and of itself.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Right?
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   I mean, I'll confess, and I'm pretty sure if I take a vote right now,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   how many of you guys have a hard time asking for help?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   But the thing about it is, think about our faith.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   We are in a position where by necessity we are taught,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   "Pray to the Lord for daily bread."
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Think about that.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I need to pray to my Father in heaven because I am his child for daily sustenance.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   But sometimes, and let me ask you, in your times of difficulty,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   in your moments of hardship, do you harden up?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Do you resort to, "I've got to power through this"?
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   I don't need your help kind of mentality.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   You might not verbalize it, but do you express that kind of attitude?
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Or is this challenging to you?
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   "Lord, help me."
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   It's like I need to ask you for my daily bread, for everything that I need in this moment.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I also need in my greatest needs, in my greatest moments,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   and here and now in my greatest aspiration to ask you.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And that's why I think the story is powerful because she comes to the Lord,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   again, against certain barriers and obstacles.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   She's making a scene.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   I don't know if there was a massive crowd around her.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   There must have been others.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Clearly, the disciples that are watching.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Clearly, by this time that she's asking, they're already annoyed.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   She's making a scene of it, not intentionally,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   but because she knows, "I am in this position where I need to ask you."
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   And it's in those moments, for me, I'm thinking about it.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   I realize when I give advice now, like, there was this weird time when I think when people,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   you know, excited about, let's say, parenting, excited about wanting to help people in,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   let's say, tangible advice and practical things that we can do to help parenting.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   I would always give, like, "Well, did you try this? Did you try that?"
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   But now I realize, like, "Hmm, I need to stay off the, like, giving, like, typical advice.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Did you try giving him some water?" You know?
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Maybe he's just angry, you know?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   "Did you try giving him some food?"
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Because my guess is this woman probably has already tried everything.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   If we're jumping down into this story, sympathizing with her,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   she's in a desperate situation where her daughter is cruelly,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Scripture says it's cruelly, like, malintent, bad, horrendously demonized.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   And so she comes to the Lord to ask.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   And so, again, as a quick, quick admonition for you and me,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   recall that we ask the Lord for mercies.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   We ask the Lord in beseeching, with humility, outstretched hands.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Psalm 51, verse 1 and 2 is a famous one.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   It says, "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   according to your great compassion.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Blot out my transgressions, wash away all my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin."
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   She calls out to the Son of David, asking for mercy.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Now, I'm going to just highlight this for a second here.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   The reason why I'm essentially commending her faith, so to speak,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   is because in the way that she's approaching the Lord,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   I don't think it is just simply a humanistic, "We get it, you're desperate,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   so therefore you're coming running over here for Him."
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   I think she's exhibiting faith.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Clearly, she is recognizing Him for the stature of who He says He is.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Whereas the Pharisees would never, ever dare acknowledge, "Oh, you're the Son of David."
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   No, they call Him, "Rabbi, good teacher," right?
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Maybe, "Miracle worker," but they will never confess that He is the Son of David
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   because to do so would be to say, "You are the coming one.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   You're the promised one, the Messiah."
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   But here and now, she says, "Have mercy on me, Son of David."
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And so we're going to highlight that as we go.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   So what we recognize here is first that she, in her humility,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   overcomes the desperation, so to speak, not by wallowing, not by fleeing,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   not by fighting, but by asking.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Point two, this woman's humble faith in the midst of silence is patient.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Why do I say this?
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   It's because if this woman is coming with such humility and asking the Lord,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   you would think the Lord Jesus would be like, "This is what I was looking for."
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Those Pharisees who just got finished accusing Him for X, Y, and Z
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   do not think of themselves as sinners.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   They never asked me for help.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   They asked me for, "Prove this and prove that."
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   But the Lord said, "I have come for sinners." Amen?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   So you would think that the Lord Jesus would say, "Right here, guys.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   This is what I was looking for."
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   But take a look at this unusual response.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Go over to verse 23, and it says, "But He did not answer her a word.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, 'Send her away
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   because she keeps shouting at us.'" Right?
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   This is really weird.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   Why would Jesus do this?
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   It's completely contrary to what you would expect,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   especially in a day and culture for us when it's like you never, ever turn away anybody.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   As a matter of fact, you just make sure that anybody and everybody can come.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   What is this?
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Well, one thing, we could just kind of hypothesize some stuff.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Maybe one of the things was that Jesus, it says that He was withdrawing from the people,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   so He's just withdrawing from her.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   A passage I want to highlight to you, Mark 7, verse 24 through 23,
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   it says that Jesus got up and went away from there to this region of Tyre,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   and when He entered into a house, He wanted no one to know of it,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   yet He could not escape the notice.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   And that's when this woman hearing of it came and said, "My daughter has an unclean spirit."
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   So the whole scenario is Jesus was trying to take His disciples and go and isolate,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   and Jesus repeatedly did this.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   All day long, He would preach, He would heal, He would exhaust Himself.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Many times in Scripture, Jesus said He was tired, but He would always go to pray.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   So maybe this was one of those moments where it's like,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   this is actually at a point in time when He had so many people already try to manipulate Him,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   so many people falsely accuse Him.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   He had so many people try to essentially violently force Him to do things that they wanted, make Him king.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   So maybe He had enough of it.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   He had enough of the, like, "You know, you just come to me because of bread.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   You come to me because you're the wicked generation.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   All you guys want is miracles and signs, and in the end, you want me to feed you and lead you into nirvana."
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   No.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   I don't know. I can't speak on His behalf because He doesn't say.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   But clearly, Jesus was withdrawing, right?
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   But that also tells me that potentially Jesus was testing Him.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Are you like every single other person?
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   But another thing Jesus says, if you look down to the next verse, take a look at this, verse 24.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   "But He answered and said, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'"
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Clearly, our Lord, He has His own timetable.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   He has His own progression of how He is going to exhibit His grace in His ministry.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   But imagine the woman hearing that, right?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   This woman is exhibiting patience in that.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Can you imagine you going to any store, walking up to the counter, people looking up at you, and then looking away?
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   The inner Karen would come out, right?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   The inner rage monster might potentially come out,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   especially if you saw the one you were trying to get the attention of, the manager, right?
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Talking about you to the other individual, saying, "I didn't come for them," right?
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Think about that.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   I want to ask you, like, we can all relate to this.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Potentially, many of you in here, maybe you are going through some really difficult times.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   Do you feel like the Lord is silent with you?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Do you feel like you've been asking, you know, "Okay, I heard the admonition.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   I can't just sit there, and I can't just peruse about my sufferings."
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   I need to ask you, so you did.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   But then in the end, you don't hear anything.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   Do we have the humility then to just continue to persist?
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Do we have the humility then to have and exhibit patience?
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   And every single one of us, we've experienced the strange feeling of disrespect.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   I asked, "Where is it?"
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   And this is something I want to highlight.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   Every single one of us knows that feeling.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Moms in here, you know this feeling.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Dinner is ready, not a single reply, right?
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   Like, nobody does anything.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Guys, we got to get going, nothing, right?
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Thank goodness you're a godly individual, because if you weren't,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   then you would just take that dish and frisbee it over, right?
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Or even in some of the most romantic, like, intimate settings,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   you feel like you say something, the other person is completely oblivious, right?
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   You're asking a question, you're saying something, and the person, "Oh, yeah."
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   The rage that comes up.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   "How dare you!" Right?
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   I want to challenge every single one of us.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   This woman is exhibiting an incredible perseverance,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   but I would also say a humility.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   To feel like you have someone's back on you is very degrading.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   But yet, she persists, and it continues to go forward.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Point number three.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   Point number three, the woman's humble faith in the midst of harsh realities is yielding.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   It is yielding.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   I hope you guys are seeing that there's a reason why, as I was meditating on this passage,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   part of me wanted to say, "Look at this woman's persevering, powerful faith!" Right?
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   But actually, what I see is, this woman is being tested.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   And part of the testing is the natural human reaction to this could be so prideful.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   But the faith that she exhibits is powerfully humble, and this is what I mean.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   I want you to think about this scenario again,
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   and I want you to think about the scenario of Jesus saying,
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   "I have only come for the house of Israel," and he's not even talking to her.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   He is answering the disciples, complaining like, "Jesus, did you do something?
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   Tell her to shoo! Lady, please stop!" Right?
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Like, they're just so frustrated, they want her to just be gone.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   And to that, Jesus is teaching or reacting to the disciples, saying,
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   "I've only come for the house of Israel."
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   But imagine her hearing that.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Imagine us in our day hearing that.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   "What? Discrimination!
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   My application is just as good as the Jews!" Right?
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   "That's not fair! What kind of compassionate leader are you?
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   I thought you were an equal opportunity lender.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   Let me talk to your manager!" Right?
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   The Karen would go nuts at that statement.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   "How dare you say that I've only come for the Jews?"
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   And if you think that was bad, look at the next passage, because it gets worse.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Look at what Jesus says.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Jesus says in verse, let's see here, 26.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   I know I skipped a verse there. I did that purposely.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Verse 26, "And he answered and said,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   'It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.'"
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Gasp! Right?
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   And then if you were to picture yourself reacting in the flesh within this scenario,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   it'd be like, "What did you say?" Right?
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   "How dare you! Is that the way you see me right now?"
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Do you remember how I talked about how asking is a humbling thing?
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   I've counseled, even again, married couples,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   where they're just like, "I'm not even going to ask anymore! I'm not a dog!"
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Like, "Whoa, whoa."
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Why? Because I'm not going to beg.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   To be in that posture where you're forced to ask is really, really humbling.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   But here and now, Jesus says something different than just that.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   He didn't say, "You better beg." He didn't say, "You better ask."
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   He said, "This is not even proper."
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Whoa. I want you to think about that.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   There was a book I was reading, "Last Name Reichen."
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   He made sense of it like this, and he said,
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   "To us, we may think that this is cruel, this is harsh,
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   but you can think of it another way. This is reality."
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Right?
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   And what he said was, "The reality is that God has made,"
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   and I love this kind of example and explanation.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   He said, "The reality is that God has made a covenant,
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   unique, exclusive relationship with the nation of Israel."
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Which means he has a relationship with the nation as a man would have with his wife.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Weird that other people will come and expect God to treat them like his own wife.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   God uniquely adopted the nation of Israel.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   He describes in the book of Ezekiel that the nation was like a naked and abandoned child in its own blood.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   And God had mercy, came down, washed the baby, clothed the baby, raised the baby,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   and now is leading the child by hand.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   That's the beautiful picture that God describes his relationship with Israel.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   But weird.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Weird that people come to God and say, "But where's my bed?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   Where's my clothes?
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   I thought you would have a savings account for my college.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Where's my wife? Where's my husband? Where's my job?"
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   Weird!
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   And this is where I say this woman's faith and her humility is shining.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   Because look at her answer.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   Her answer in verse 25 is that she came and began to bow herself down.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   That's proskuneo.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   You guys have heard that term many times.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   It means to prostrate oneself all the way low, face to the ground.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   I'm not worthy of you kind of mentality.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   To worship.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   It's synonymous to worship.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   She worshiped him even in the midst of this is not your time.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   But also even in the midst of it's not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   Look what she says.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Verse 27.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   Take a look.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   Yes, Lord.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   Gospel of Mark says, "Truth, Lord."
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   But even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from the master's table.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   And I was like, "Wow. Lady, you're witty."
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   You know, like, "That's so good.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   You're so sharp and cunning."
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   No.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   She was yielding.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   She fought against, I'm assuming because we're human, perhaps that natural inclination.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   By faith, Jesus said that our natural state is always going to be this, this struggle.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   He who desires to save his life will lose it.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   That is every single one of our struggle.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   And in that way, we have this weird presumptuousness that God highlights many times through Scripture
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   where we demand, "God, you protect me because I need to survive.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   God, you heal me. You do this for me. You provide for me.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   You acknowledge me."
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   Because that's in our own heart and our ambition.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   But she didn't do that.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   She did not have as her priority to combat him.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   "Oh, I don't think your laws are fair.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   Let me talk to you about your policies."
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   She did not make it her priority to demand that God acknowledge her as also a valuable human being
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   and made it about her identity.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   No.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   By faith, she besieged the Lord, crying out and desiring that he minister to her with help.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   Brothers and sisters, one of the things I want to highlight to you is, yes, we have, whether, you know,
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   I see it in myself, this strange expectation.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   All throughout, like, the biblical history, sinful man has invoked the name of God
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   and just demanded, "You be on my side, okay?"
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   And so many times, God would say through the prophets, "Why do you act so presumptuously?
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   When I say judgment, you say peace. What in the world is going on?
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   You go into battle, keep constantly invoking my name.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   When I told you, I'm not going with you. Why do you do that?"
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   And even Moses said, "We are a presumptuous people."
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   Right?
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   Even here in the New Testament, we're so presumptuous.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   I want to highlight this interesting passage to you.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   If you've heard me preach before, I've hit this passage many times because it is one of my all-time favorites.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   And it comes from the book of Hebrews, chapter 2, verse 14 through 18.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   So please take a look there. Hebrews 2, 14 through 18.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   And the Word of God says this, "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   he himself likewise also partook of the same,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   that through death he might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives."
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   Take a moment to pause there.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   He's answering this question, "Did Christ have to come down, be incarnate, and be flesh and blood like you and me?
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Did he have to do that?"
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   And the answer is a resounding yes.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   For God to just be like, "I forgive you all and pardon you," then he's just simply pardoning criminals.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   He would be an unjust judge.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   But because we are flesh and blood, he had to come, take our place, pay our penalty,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   and by his righteous atonement, we are truly, truly free. Amen?
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   So the answer to the question, "Did Jesus have to come?" is yes, amen.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   But then take a look at verse 16.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   Verse 16 says, "But for surely he does not give help to the angels,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   but he gives help to the descendants of Abraham.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in all things,
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   What?
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   What am I saying here?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   The demons are looking at this like, "What in the world is going on?
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   Why are you helping creatures lower than us?"
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   To the question of, "Did Jesus really have to come down?"
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   In one sense, it was a resounding, "Of course, yes!"
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   And without it, there is no justice.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   Without it, there is no freedom and there is no grace for you.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   But on this sense, it's like a, "No!"
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   Is God in any way obligated to help fallen angels?
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   And the strange answer is, "No."
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   Is God obligated to you?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   Is God obligated to me?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   Does he owe us anything?
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   And the scripture is really, really clear.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   He owes us nothing.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   It's some weird presumption on our end that says,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   "You have to be like the store where not only do you provide goods and services
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   to the best of your ability being fair and equitable,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   but if I'm disappointed, you better hear me."
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   We're approaching it with little faith then.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   That is small, small faith.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   We should be shocked.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   He's offering help to who?
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   As one of my friends here says, "I want you to remember that we are Gentiles
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   and we dare not be uppity about our salvation."
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   He says that, I laugh, but it's so true.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   What do I mean by this?
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   Do you recognize that in Ephesians Chapter 2, because of the length and take of time,
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   I can't read the whole chapter, but it begins with,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   "You are not only dogs, but you're a dead corpse.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   You're dead in your transgressions.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   You're children of wrath.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   You have your own father."
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   You're walking in disobedience.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   And then later on, it describes, "You have no promise," like the Israelites do.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   "You're outside of the commonwealth of Israel.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   You have no hope. You have no inheritance because you have no God."
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   That's the state of affairs.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   That's the reality.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   And by faith, this woman is getting the glimpse of that.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   And beyond and above what the other Pharisees were thinking, she got it.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   "Right, Lord, and that's why I am willing to take whatever you give me.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   Have mercy on me. Help me," she asked.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   I think to me, that's powerful.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   Can I confess something?
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   Sometimes when I have a hard time, I'm all stressed out,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   and then I say these words, "I've been praying about."
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   I think I need to rephrase that.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   "I've been mulling, daydreaming, and complaining about."
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   I'm a man of, like, I have deep thoughts that I don't like to share with people,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   and I overthink everything.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   So what I typically do is if I have a problem,
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   I trace every scenario down to its nth degree
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   and think about all the pros and cons down the line.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   That's why it takes me a long time to decide something.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   I'm just ruminating, "If this, then B. If this, then C."
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   I'm just sitting there, right?
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   And then at the end of that, I tell people, "I prayed about it."
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   Brothers and sisters, your ruminating about your hardships
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   is not the same as humble requests, right?
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   But this woman, even in the midst of that, I guess you could say, rude and harsh reality,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   she comes, says, "Yes, Lord, but would you help me?"
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   That's powerful.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   She overcame that innate which every single one of us--
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   because I pray that I would have my pride overcome like that.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   I place myself in her scenarios, and I say silly things like, "How dare you?"
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   Because that's natural.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   But by faith, she's overcoming the flesh.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   And that's why I say I think she's doing much more than just desperately coming
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   to find medicine for her daughter, right?
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   She's giving God worship.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   And that's why when Jesus is looking at this, he commends her and says,
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   "You have great faith."
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Because starting from men of old, the great Christians, the great faithful,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   behaved like her.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   I want to highlight for you a passage in Isaiah 6, verse 5.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   You know that when Isaiah came before the Lord, he came actually with a complaint.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   Because at that time, kings were being assassinated.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   Potentially, there's no king on the throne.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   What in the world are we going to do, Lord?
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   And what he sees is the amazing picture of God on the throne.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   And that's when he says, "Yes!"
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   No, no, that's not what he says.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   That's when he says, "I am ruined."
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   Because when you have faith and you see God, you see yourself in reference to God.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   And next thing you know, he says, "I am a man of unclean lips,
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   and I live among a people of unclean lips.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   I am undone."
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   Peter, when he saw the power of Jesus in Luke 5, verse 8,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   Peter sees Jesus, he sees power that he has command over everything.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   And what does he say?
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   He looks down low and he falls at his feet and says, "Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man."
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   You guys know the story.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   The person of faith sees the reality and says, "Not like the Pharisee.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   Thank goodness I'm not like all of you.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   No, like the tax collector.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   Lord, have mercy on me, for I am a sinner."
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   That's great faith.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   And the woman exhibited it.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   And so I asked, like, you think about this whole scenario, and it's pretty profound.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   Jesus is withdrawing to teach his disciples, preparing.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   He's constantly preparing them for the cross that he's going to endure.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   But what an incredible object lesson.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   He just got teaching the disciples.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   The Pharisee is asked, "You folks are unclean.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   Why in the world do you not keep the traditions?"
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   And then you basically are defiling yourself.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   Unclean people, they accuse them like that.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   And Jesus says to them, "It's not what goes into your mouth that's making you unclean.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   It's the stuff that's coming out of your mouth that makes you unclean."
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   And the disciples are like, "Can you explain that for us?
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   We don't really get it."
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   It's really funny.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   The disciples are great.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   It feels like them.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   It's like, "Huh?
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   What's going on?"
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   What an object lesson.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   And that's why I think our Lord, he's a merciful one.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   I believe he was drawing the faith out of her.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   Disciples are annoying.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   "What are we doing with this girl?
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   Let's kick her out."
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   Right?
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   Like I don't know what they were thinking.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   But then Jesus says, "Great faith."
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   In the Greek, it's mega faith.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   It's not mega like the way we use mega, but it does mean massive.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   It's mega.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   It's massive.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   For her to say, for her to be able to say.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   Not only, I'm assuming, if Jesus made the analogy even worse than a dog.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   Right?
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   If he said something like, "Not only do you not give the food to the dogs,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   but you don't bring in the stray."
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   She'd be like, "Yes, Lord."
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   I am the stray.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   I was out of the camp.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   I know I have no place here.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   It's not like she doesn't know, as she's a Canaanite woman,
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   have nothing to do with this Jewish Messiah.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   She absolutely knows.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   It was not her ambition to make it fair.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   It was not her ambition to be Jesus' highest priority at the moment.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   She was seeking mercy.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   And in that way, guys, brothers and sisters, would be our humble faith.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   I want to ask you, how are you--first, I ask,
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   how are you struggling with your sufferings, your hardships?
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   But I want to ask, how are you genuinely coming to God?
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   Are you coming with sentiments of complaint?
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   "God, no one's reaching out to me here.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   God, you don't say enough in your Bible about this."
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   And you think of faith as like some kind of switch where, like,
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   if it switched, then everything would be grand.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   By faith, yeah, I would know what I would do about my business.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   By faith, I would know if I should do this or not.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   And then by faith, should I marry her?
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   And then you just switch it on, and it's like, "Ooh, I get it."
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Use your wisdom.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   Use God's given discernment that he's given you.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   By faith, we recognize, "Lord, everything I have,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   there's nothing of my own.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   Everything I have is from your gracious, merciful hand.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   And so every suffering I'm experiencing now, I request of you grace and mercy."
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   And you know what an incredible privilege we have.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   Are we in a situation where we're just going to extend our hands,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   and who knows when he'll answer?
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   I don't know, right?
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   No.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   We have the privilege of knowing that our God, his heart is so kind,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   he lavishes us.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   And we know that as a good father, he is going to answer us
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   according to his good fatherly wisdom.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   And so that's why for us, this humility is going to produce
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   every fruit of thankfulness, praise, confidence, joy.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   This humility, then, is tied to every other spiritual fruit
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   we're going to produce in our lives.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   Does that make sense?
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   And so I pray that we would recognize my way of conclusion.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   Again, I don't want to just simply, you know,
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   see this as like my attempt to stick her into the hall of faith, you know?
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   I don't want to just simply like commend her,
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   but what a challenge to have that kind of humility.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   But let's turn it now to our God, our loving Heavenly Father,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   when he's thinking about your strong faith.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   He's not thinking, "Go, right? Convert Africa for me."
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   And Pastor Peter has been preaching this heavily like,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   "It's not contingent on you, right?
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   It's God."
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   She didn't bring anything to the table because what God desired of us,
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   he said, "What do I require of you, man?
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   To love mercy and to walk humbly with me."
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   And this is where we get to say, "Yes, Lord.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   I trust you.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   I've got nothing to bring to the table.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   So I request of you mercies.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   Thank you for lavishing upon me every grace and every love."
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   Let's pray.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   Lord God, what incredible thanks and appreciation and gratitude we owe to you.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   Lord, one can say that left to ourselves,
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   we do not even have the privilege or right to lift up a word of request to you.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   But thank you, God, that you hear our prayers.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   Thank you, God, that you extend your grace upon us.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   I pray, Lord, that we would be a people marked with this faith
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   where we see the state of our being.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   We are lost sinners graced by you.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   And I pray, Father God, that I will produce in us incredible, incredible love and affection for you.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   We thank you, Lord, for this day.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   Let's take a moment of time of prayer as we reflect on the sermon.

[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   Amen. Let's all bow our heads for a word of prayer.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   Our God, we thank you so much.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   Lord, we thank you for the healing that you bring for the many who have suffered.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   We thank you, God, for the grace that you impart on us,
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   that you would change our hearts internally.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   Thank you, God, for the strengthening that you give.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   And Lord, we can just continue to go on and on and on,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   for we know, Father God, that we have everything in you.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   Lord, as we looked at the passage today,
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   I pray, Father God, that we would be challenged,
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   that even in our everyday,
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   Lord, that we would continue to exercise great trust in you,
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   and what's more, we would keep learning what it means, then,
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   to live in dependency upon our Father,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   to humbly request things,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   and God, to have the proper attitude,
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   the humble attitude that is also in Christ.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   And so I pray in that way, Lord, may it continue to give glory to you,
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   and may we, Father God, continue to grow in our relationship with you and honor you.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   and keep you in the presence of his glory, blameless with great joy,
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority,
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   before all time and now and forever. Amen.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   God sent his Son,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   they called him Jesus,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   he came to love,
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   he loved for good,
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   he lived and died,
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   to buy my poor soul,
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   an empty grave is there to save your head,
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   because he lives,
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   I can face tomorrow,
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   because he lives,
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   all fear is gone,
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   because I know,
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   he holds the future,
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   and life is worth the living,
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   just because he lives.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   Amen.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   If you would just take a seat for one moment.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   The people that are on this side, actually you are excused to go ahead and exit out that side door.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   So you can go ahead and do that now.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   For the people in the courtyard, please take this time to go ahead and exit towards the back.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   We're asking this group just to give it a minute or two for the courtyard to exit out,
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   and then you guys are excused as well.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   So just after a minute or two, please go ahead and just start proceeding to exit out the main entrance.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   Thank you so much.
