[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   Please turn your Bibles over to Exodus chapter 32.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.640]   And a famous passage in Exodus, we're there this morning because our youth group has been
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.720]   walking through the book of Exodus for the last year.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.920]   And it's been an amazing journey through the scripture.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.160]   It's been amazing because actually the content of the entire story is absolutely amazing.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.400]   The deliverance of the nation of Israel from Egypt by the powerful hand of God is an amazing,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   amazing story.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.480]   It's an amazing truth.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.760]   And I wish there were greater synonyms, more profound ways to say it.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.220]   But I would like to do is actually go through how amazing it's been.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.640]   Even just from the very beginning, God had prepared for an amazing deliverance for the
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.760]   nation.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.000]   It wasn't just from Moses.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.440]   It wasn't even just his birth and how he survived the massacre of the Israelite baby boys.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.260]   But actually from long before, God has been preparing to build up his people.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.440]   And here and now in terms of the deliverance of the nation, God too by his sovereign hand
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.600]   spared Moses, placed him in the hands of individuals who will raise him in the palace, and then
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.720]   also eventually prepare him to be a man that will deliver his people.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.960]   What's more, the amazing promise of God was with him.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.640]   From the burning bush, God promised Moses, "I have seen the affliction of my people and
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.720]   I am coming down.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.440]   I will deliver them with a mighty hand.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.440]   You will see my judgments.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.440]   I'm going to place you in a land flowing with milk and honey."
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.200]   What's more, upon the execution of that deliverance, it was an amazing thing.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.280]   I mean, we don't have the time to do it.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.000]   I wish we did, but to rehearse, every single miracle of God affected the entire land.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.320]   And people could see this God is more powerful than any idol, any presumed provision we have
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.400]   in the gods of Egypt.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.000]   And what's more, even at the end of the story when the 10 plagues go through the land and
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.280]   the people finally are saying, "You may go," and then they start leaving, God leads them
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.500]   on a million man march.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.640]   And there are epic moments when people are walking, they come to the sea, their backs
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.460]   up against the wall, so to speak, and God provides for them.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.860]   God ultimately splits the sea in half when they walk on dry land.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.140]   And even as they walk, though, God's amazing protection is with them.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.880]   These passages I want to highlight for you, that even as they walk, God protects their
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.240]   feet.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.840]   Scripture talks about how their feet and shoes did not wear and tatter.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840]   Why?
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.320]   Because God allowed them to have provision even in their walk.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.360]   Who provided the cloud?
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.120]   Who provided the warmth of the pillar of fire?
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.560]   Who provided the food that just shows up every single day?
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.920]   I mean, the provision and protection is amazing.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.040]   Here's a verse I want to highlight to you, Exodus 14, verse 19.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.360]   It says that the angel of God who has been going before the camp of Israel moved and
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.840]   went behind them.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.140]   The pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.300]   So it came about between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel, that there was a cloud
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.760]   along with darkness, yet it gave light at night.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440]   Thus, one did not come near the other all night.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.800]   The reason why I highlight that for you is because when I say there was protection, I
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.440]   don't even mean just the small provisions of the cloud, or not the small provisions,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.640]   but the provisions of the daily necessities.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.360]   There was an angel in their midst.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.760]   Here's another passage, Exodus chapter 23, verse 20 through 23.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   "Behold, I'm going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way, bring you
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.960]   into the place which I have prepared.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.600]   Be on your guard before him and obey his voice.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.640]   Do not be rebellious towards him, for he will not pardon your transgressions since
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.200]   my name is in him.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.720]   But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.360]   enemies and an adversary to your adversaries, for my angel will go before you and bring
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   you into the land."
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.520]   It's been amazing, okay?
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.360]   That's the point I want to get across.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.960]   And where they are now is another amazing moment in their journey.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.460]   They have had an angel, supernatural being, guard them and protect them to this place
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.600]   where they are now at Mount Sinai.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.280]   And in my last previous sermon a little while back, what I mentioned was that God had an
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.880]   amazing meeting with them where he came down with a covered glory.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.640]   He filled the mountain with smoke, thunder, and lightning and said, "I am here to meet
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.760]   you.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.560]   I am here to be with you.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.840]   I am here to give you my law, my good law, give you my presence.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.720]   I desire to be your God and I desire for you to be my people."
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.160]   And in this moment, God gives them an amazing law and in that, God gives them an amazing
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.320]   covenant, a relationship that you and I are bound together.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.760]   And God in many ways also is giving them promise of his words.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.680]   It is this moment that they are here in Exodus chapter 32.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.200]   In Exodus chapter 32, a famous passage that we know of, they're still at the mountain
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.880]   seeing the glory of God covering this mountain that stands before him.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.000]   And so, with such an amazing journey, we wonder how things will go.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.680]   Well, let's read how things are going.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.080]   Chapter 32 verse 1, "Now when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.840]   mountain, the people assembled around Aaron and said to him, 'Come, make us a God who
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.260]   go before us.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.200]   For this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   has become of him.'
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.800]   Aaron said to them, 'Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.760]   sons, your daughters, and bring them to me.'
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.800]   Then all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears and brought them
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   to Aaron.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.760]   He took this from their hand, fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into molten
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   calf.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.200]   And they said, 'This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.'
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.040]   Now when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.680]   And Aaron made a proclamation and said, 'Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord.'
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.360]   So the next day they arose early and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.400]   People sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play."
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.040]   Oh no.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.040]   Amazing journey.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.720]   Nothing short of supernatural, profoundly genuine, life-altering greatness of God delivering
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   you.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   And bam.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.000]   A miserable failure.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.920]   The people, because Moses is not coming down, perhaps kind of like if there's a senior pastor
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.320]   who's been the founding pastor along their journey, he's gone.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.840]   They're like, 'Where is he?
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.760]   Did he abandon us?'
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.320]   And then they turn to Aaron who's kind of like an associate pastor.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.800]   And I'm sitting here thinking, 'Come on, Aaron.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.280]   Making a bad name for all us associate pastors.'
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.440]   They go to him and say, 'What shall we do?'
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.440]   And this is it.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.360]   In the midst where God's presence is seen on the mountain like a volcano, they turn
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.000]   to a gold piece that looks like a cow and they worship and say, 'Ta-da.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.180]   Here's your God.'
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.280]   This is a miserable, miserable failure of the greatest kind.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.360]   And what I'd like to do today is not simply gloss over the sins of Israel or even our
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.080]   sins but actually dissect, analyze, and examine everything so that we dare not do something
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.000]   like this.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.600]   Because God, upon seeing it, verse 7, if you look down at the passage, 'Then the Lord
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.280]   spoke to Moses, "Go down at once for your people whom you brought up from the land of
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.720]   Egypt have corrupted themselves.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.640]   They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.520]   They have made for themselves a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.640]   to it and said, 'This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.'
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:06.440]   The Lord said to Moses, 'I have seen this people and behold, they are an obstinate people.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.960]   Now then, let me alone that my anger may burn against them, that I may destroy them, and
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.400]   I will make of you a great nation.'"
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.280]   You understand what he's saying, right?
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.840]   I'm going to destroy everyone.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.300]   Start over with you.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.720]   We dare not take sin lightly because God is an absolutely holy God who has every prerogative
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.960]   to judge and it would have been just, it would have been proper and appropriate that God
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.560]   would actually annihilate all of these people.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   Why?
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.400]   Because I have a case against Israel in this situation, in this narrative and story, that
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.320]   this was not just a, "Oh dear, the leader was gone."
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.960]   So you understand people were just trying to make a solution.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.160]   No, this was first degree disobedience.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   I want to make a case to you and prove to you that this is first degree disobedience.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.560]   And what I mean by that is if you know much about law, there is first degree murder, there
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.440]   is secondary murder, there is involuntary manslaughter.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.640]   I always had that stuff kind of mixed around.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.000]   I always thought it leveled up so if you did second degree murder, it was like extra bad.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.640]   It was the other way around.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.160]   There's secondary murder which is more like fits of rage.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.880]   You're mad and you're angry and yes, you're getting violent, but your intention was not
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.420]   to kill somebody.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.480]   Maybe you expected to harm somebody, but not to slaughter him.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.760]   What I'm saying to you is this is not that.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.840]   This is first degree disobedience.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840]   Why do I say this?
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.960]   Because number one, this is first degree disobedience because they already knew the Ten Commandments.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.120]   Upon careful examination of this narrative and story, I always presumed Moses was on
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.120]   the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights, yes?
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   What was he receiving?
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   The tablets.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.360]   What was on the tablets?
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.720]   The Ten Commandments.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:59.360]   So there was almost a sentiment in me that thought if God was just a little bit faster
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.000]   or like download it, cast it down, project it or something like that, you just missed
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   it.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.040]   And then I was upset at the people like, "Gosh, it's just a little bit longer and you would
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.720]   have had the Ten Commandments."
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   Wrong.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.520]   They already had it.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.040]   The narrative goes that Moses was actually upon this mountain longer in total because
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.760]   he met the Lord.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.040]   God spoke to Moses and the elders, including who?
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.680]   Aaron and the leaders of the 12 tribes of Israel and gave them the Ten Commandments
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.660]   and then told them, "Go speak this to the nation."
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.660]   Moses did.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.200]   He said, "Upon your hearing, I give you the word and covenant of God."
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.000]   And the people all heard it.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.200]   Why is this first degree murder?
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.800]   First degree disobedience, sorry.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.160]   It's because the people responded, "Then we will obey it."
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.280]   They said they would obey.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.800]   And for this, let's read the story.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.000]   Go over in your Bibles, please.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.080]   It's a little bit long, so let's all read it together.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.320]   Follow along with me as I read in chapter 24.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.120]   Exodus chapter 24, starting from verse one, gives us this account of how Moses received
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.040]   the law and then gave it to them.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.840]   The Ten Commandments happens in chapter 20.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.240]   Yes?
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.040]   After chapter 20 are many other laws that God gives.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.960]   Here in chapter 24, then, is already having time pass that Moses was up at the mountain
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.520]   with God.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.680]   Chapter 24 says, "Then he said to Moses, 'Come up to the Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.720]   and Behu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and you shall worship at a distance.'"
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.040]   You see who's all there?
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.840]   "Moses alone, however, shall come near the Lord, but they shall not come near, nor shall
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.080]   the people come up with him."
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.680]   Verse three, "Then Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the Lord and
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.160]   all the ordinances, and all the people answered with one voice and said, 'All the words
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.920]   which the Lord has spoken, we will do it.'"
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   Everybody in the congregation got together, heard the words, and they responded.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.760]   So then what does Moses do?
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.000]   Moses writes down all the words of the Lord.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.720]   "Then he arose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.120]   with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel."
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.600]   There was representation.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.360]   There was recording.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.400]   Moses actually had the words of God written on paper before God wrote it on stone.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.640]   Verse five, "He sent young men to the sons of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.360]   and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the Lord.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.480]   Moses took half the blood and put it in the basins, and the other half of the blood he
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.440]   sprinkled on the altar.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.000]   Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people, and
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.080]   they said, 'All that the Lord has spoken, we will do, and we will be obedient.'"
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.320]   This is not repeating the same thing.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.480]   They did it twice.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.240]   They said to God in the hearing of everyone, "Lord, we heard your word, and we will do
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.240]   it.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.520]   And upon that the covenant is made."
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.600]   How do we know?
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.800]   Because in the next verse, verse eight, "So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:07.040]   people and said, 'Behold the blood of the covenant.'"
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.880]   This was the binding commitment.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.400]   This was the dedication of the people.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.640]   "God, we've heard your word.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.040]   We know that your word is for our protection, for our holiness, for our representation with
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.320]   you to be your people.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.440]   We will do it.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.240]   Deliver us."
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.520]   And then Moses takes the blood and sprinkles everybody.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:36.040]   Verse nine, "Then Moses went up with," guess who, there's our man, associate pastor Aaron,
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.400]   "Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel, and they saw the God of Israel
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.600]   under his feet.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.320]   There appeared to be a pavement of sapphire as clear as the sky itself."
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.440]   Did you know that?
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.360]   These details sometimes I don't remember, but when I read it, I'm like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.720]   Aaron saw the glory of God as a sapphire crosses the sky."
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.720]   And then guess what?
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.160]   "Yet he did not stretch out his hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.640]   They saw God, and they ate and drank."
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.400]   Where do you think Aaron got his ideas?
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.640]   They dined with the Lord and God did not kill him.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.920]   Verse 12, "Now the Lord said to Moses, 'Come up to me on the mountain and remain here,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.680]   and I'll give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandments which I have written
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.840]   for their instruction.'
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.520]   So Moses arose with Joshua his servant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God."
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.960]   So think about this.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.080]   People say, "I don't know what happened to Moses."
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.080]   Lies!
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.920]   They know exactly what happened to Moses.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.560]   He went with Joshua to the mountain because God called him.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.120]   Next, verse 14, "But to the elders he said, 'Wait here for us until we return to you.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.800]   And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.160]   Whoever has a legal matter, let him approach them.'
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.120]   So Aaron was given charge.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.520]   You decide matters.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.200]   You be in charge and take care of the people.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   I will return."
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.960]   Verse 15, "Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.440]   The glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.320]   And on the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud and to the eyes
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.600]   of the sons of Israel."
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.160]   To who?
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.600]   Just the 70?
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   Just a few leaders?
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   No, to everyone.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.560]   "The appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.520]   Moses entered the midst of the cloud, and he went up to the mountain.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.400]   Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights."
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.800]   Do you see my case?
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.440]   This is not happenstance mistake.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   Do you see my case that this is first degree disobedience?
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.720]   That this was not, 'I didn't mean to.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.640]   I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way.'
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.800]   This is not like that at all.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.880]   What's more, it is high-handed rebellion.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.600]   It is first degree disobedience because the people aggressively demanded their way of
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.860]   Aaron.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.860]   Maybe they saw.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.040]   Maybe there are a bunch of people who are already complaining.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   They're like, "Aaron, what are we going to do?"
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   "I don't know, man."
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   "Aaron, what are we going to do?"
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   "I don't know, man."
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040]   It's like, "Aaron, we got to plan something."
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   "I don't know."
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   "I don't know."
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.080]   And then they felt, "Fine, we're going to take over this guy."
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.880]   They massed together as a group, as a crowd, and what's really interesting is they say,
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.760]   "Come, make us a God."
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.200]   The Hebrew word for come actually is a command that means stand up.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.320]   They were commanding Aaron, "Do what we tell you."
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.720]   And Aaron, unfortunately, he should have been the one who knows better than them.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.560]   He was amidst the group of select few God called to the mountain.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.840]   He saw God's glory.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.640]   He heard God's audible voice.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.780]   He walked up farther than any of those.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.280]   He should have been the first one to say, "Well, that's a dumb idea.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.400]   Do you see the mountain?
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.560]   It's on fire.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.080]   And he said he's going to kill you."
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.320]   But instead, Aaron succumbed to his fear of the people and said, "Okay."
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.840]   He didn't even consult the other leaders.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   He didn't even pray.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.560]   He didn't even ask, "What other options do we have?"
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.920]   He just did what they asked him to do.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.560]   There was an absolute failure in leadership.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.520]   And when you see this, I make the case.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.600]   When you see a fat, fat sinking hole in the ground, it did not just happen overnight.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.840]   There has probably been long decay farther than what we can see.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.720]   And that is my next case.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:21.400]   We dare not gloss over sin, especially when it's this heinous, especially when it's first
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:28.640]   degree, and say, "Well, you know, everybody's prone to make mistakes."
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.200]   You stop and ask, "How deep does this go?"
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.600]   And my case to you is, when there is such sinful disobedience, it goes deeper than the
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   act itself.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.720]   There are deep-root sins of the heart that we must uproot.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.400]   We have to ask, "What permission did they receive?
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.840]   Who gave them this right to make a calf?"
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.400]   My case to you is, there are deeper issues than meets the eye.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.000]   Let me prove it to you.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.220]   First, let me ask you this question.
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.700]   Why did the Israelites worship a cow?
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.000]   Other people, and maybe if it was me, if I'm worshiping anything, I'm worshiping something
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.280]   awesome, tigers, lions, you know, like, I don't know, like, king cobras that look awesome.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   Why a cow?
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.480]   Important question, yes?
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.160]   What was in them is the question that when they had the idea, there's a vacuum of leadership,
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.520]   Moses is gone, my first idea is, "Mooo," like, why?
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.760]   And what that reveals is the question, yes, why was that already there?
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.360]   And it's because back in Egypt, the cow was awesome.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.240]   It's because in their lives previous, that's what they knew to be power.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.480]   Let me tell you that there was gods of bulls that looked like bulls.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.840]   There was a god of Hathor in the Egyptian culture that represented the blessings, the
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.400]   prosperity and fertility.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.440]   There was the god Isis, which probably you have heard before, the queen of the gods,
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.280]   who was represented as a cow with horns.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.720]   There was a god named Menware, who was the sacred bull of Ra.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.080]   You guys recognize that in there?
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.160]   Ra was the ultimate god, kind of like Zeus from the Greeks.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.280]   He was the ultimate god, and he was shaped in the shape of a falcon, and his cow was
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.920]   laden with gold.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.360]   There was another god, Apis, who was a bull considered to be the manifestation of the
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.400]   creation of the world.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.880]   The greatest gods in Egypt were cows.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.680]   And what's really interesting is later on when he says, when Aaron and the peoples actually
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.960]   make a calf, do you know what they say?
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.520]   These are your gods.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.160]   What's my point there?
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.600]   My point is this.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.680]   At the first sign of trouble, the nation of Israel always kind of revealed what was in
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.240]   their heart.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.800]   When they were at the waterbeds of the Red Sea, when there were nations who were trying
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.440]   to attack them, what would they say?
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.600]   "What are we doing here?
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.240]   At least in Egypt we had something.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.240]   What are we doing here?
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.080]   At least in Egypt we had food."
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.800]   What do you think that means?
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.960]   When at the first sign of trouble, at the first sign of hardship, they start turning
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.600]   to what was familiar, comfortable, and good for them.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.440]   What was in their mind and what was in their heart?
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.840]   And I have to commentator says this.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.040]   What we see when these individuals turn to the Egyptian gods so quickly is that once
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.480]   again it is proving more difficult to get Egypt out of the hearts of the Israelites
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.000]   than it is to get Israelite bodies out of Egypt.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.240]   Do you hear that?
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.280]   I thought that was incredibly, incredibly insightful.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:46.080]   It is more difficult to get Egypt out of the Israelite heart than it was to get Israelite
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.320]   bodies out of Egypt.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.960]   Now more than what a commentator says, the Bible says this.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.360]   If you turn in your Bibles to Acts chapter 7, starting from verse 39 to 41, this is when
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.040]   Stephen is giving a defense against the Jews who are persecuting him.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:07.040]   As Stephen gives his defense, he gives the most amazing, amazing recount of Jewish history.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.040]   Why?
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.080]   His point is to say, "You are just like them."
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.240]   Well, how are they?
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.280]   Our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him but repudiated him and in their hearts
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.480]   turned back to Egypt.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.120]   Saying to Aaron, "Make for us gods who will go before us for this Moses who led us out
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.480]   of the land of Egypt.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   We have no idea.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.360]   We do not know what happened to him."
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.640]   At that time, they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.760]   in the works of their hands.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.520]   Verse 51, "You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.160]   resisting the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.360]   You are doing just as your father did."
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.000]   Wow.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.920]   Stephen gives an amazing rebuke to the leaders of the time, the religious individuals.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.160]   You are stiff-necked like your fathers.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.480]   What were they stiff-necked in?
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.240]   Well, Stephen actually starts to quote Old Testament prophecy.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.680]   It comes from the book of Amos, so I'll actually read it directly from that passage.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.880]   Amos chapter 5, verse 25 to 26, just listen to this.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.960]   God asked them, "Did you represent me or present me with sacrifices and grain offerings in
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.840]   the wilderness for 40 years?
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   O house of Israel, you also carried along Sikith your king, Ki and your image, the stars
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.600]   of your gods which you made for yourself."
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   For who?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.800]   For yourself.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.740]   What is he saying?
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.120]   What I'm saying is there's a million man march out of Egypt, but I am willing to bet
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.320]   a huge portion of them, maybe not the majority, but at least a huge consistency of them, carried
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.800]   in their pocket and in their heart the gods of Egypt.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.240]   Out of Egypt, they probably brought along the gold figurines in their pockets, in their
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.200]   sacks, and in their wagons, and in their bags.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   Why?
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.640]   Because it was also always in their heart.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.600]   They loved comfortably the things that gave them comfort before.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.720]   They never actually left.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.440]   A way of application to every single one of us when we deal with sin, if you just say,
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.880]   "I just need to stop idolatry.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.720]   I just need to do more of reading.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.280]   I just need to do more of this."
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:14.320]   It does not sometimes then actually account for and diagnose and then actually apply a
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.880]   solution to what is wrong.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.140]   Because what is wrong is in the heart.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.360]   What I'm trying to prove to you is the absence of Moses was not a temptation.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:29.440]   It was only an opportunity for them to worship openly that which they already worshiped secretly
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.440]   in their heart.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   Let me repeat that.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:38.560]   The absence of Moses was just an opportunity to put out in the open what was already in
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.480]   their soul.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   That's what I mean as a case for first-degree disobedience that has much more to do than
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.680]   just what meets the eye, but internally there is a struggle for what was already contained
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.080]   in their heart.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   Look at the scenario.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.000]   It is baffling.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.640]   Who was running around tempting them?
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.080]   "Do you want to worship this?"
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.920]   There was nobody.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.480]   In the vacuum, that was their volitional idea.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.920]   Make us another God.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.720]   Make us another God.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.760]   Make us this calf and their wicked heart desired it.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.360]   For us, we have to do a thorough job examining the heart.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.440]   Please understand that I'm not just trying to weigh heavy on sin.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.600]   Neither am I trying to make this a soapbox I stand on.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.400]   It is my conviction that if we do not analyze, dissect, and sin for what it is, we will never
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.280]   find an appropriate solution and our disobedience will continue.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.760]   Is it not?
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.480]   So what are the deeper issues of the heart?
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.760]   Let's begin actually in dissection.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.840]   What are the deeper issues of the heart?
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.240]   First, the deeper issues of the heart start with personal selfish desires.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.960]   Selfish desires.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.400]   There are selfish desires that they are pursuing.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.920]   God calls it out in Amos.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.040]   Who did you make that idol for?
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.120]   For me?
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.160]   Come on.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.840]   You slapped my name on it, but you know it was for you.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.360]   That's what God said.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.600]   You did it for a while.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.840]   Yes, maybe you thought you were persevering in it, but you made this for you.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.520]   You did not make this for me.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.240]   The fact of the matter is you read the story and you ask the question, "Okay, they make
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.520]   the calf.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.720]   What comes out of that?
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   What comes out of that?"
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   Hilarious story.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.080]   You know what comes out of it?
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.120]   "Tomorrow we feast to the Lord."
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.120]   Okay.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.960]   The next day they rose, they offered the offerings, they brought the priest's offerings, they
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.800]   sat down, they ate, they drank, and they rose up to play.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.600]   Do you know what happened?
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.880]   Is they played.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.760]   There wasn't any fruit of holiness.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.520]   There wasn't any greater worship or service.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.840]   There wasn't any faithfulness.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.840]   They played.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.920]   And in the end, that's what they were seeking.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.760]   They wanted to satisfy whatever desire or inclination was in their heart.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.840]   I think about all the riots, all the complaints in this day, and in the end, what is it?
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.840]   What do we want?
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.360]   When do we want it?
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.880]   Now.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:08.960]   And actually, if you think about it, everything in terms of idolatry is just like that.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.520]   Idolatry is for me.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.280]   Write this down.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.920]   Any idol is an idol because it's by me and for me.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.520]   Let me repeat that.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.080]   Any idol is an idol because it's by me and for me.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.440]   Stephen, who was making that accusation against the nation of Israel in the past, said, "You
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.360]   rejoice in the work of your hands."
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.760]   And then God said, "You made that for you."
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.000]   It's an idol because it's made by you, and it is unlike the real God who demands exclusive
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   faithfulness.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.400]   It is unlike the real God who demands that we mimic him and follow after his holiness.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.200]   It's different than the real God who desires true worship from our heart.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   That God is there for you.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.360]   It's like that Buddha at an Asian restaurant where he's sitting up at the front door and
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.800]   it's just like, "Come, and I'll take whatever you got.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.880]   Pennies, nickels, watermelons, oranges."
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.680]   I always laugh every time I see one of those things.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:08.160]   It takes whatever you have and implicitly, it doesn't speak to you, it's there for you.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.280]   For your fortune, for your luck, and for your business.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.560]   You know that's what it's about.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.560]   That's an idol.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.640]   By you and for you.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   And our selfish desires that precede that is our pride and our arrogance constantly
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.000]   seeking not God's good pleasure, but our good pleasure.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.680]   And when we do that, we will always disobey.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.200]   That kind of selfishness always lies to us.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.020]   It lies to us that this is for the better good.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.040]   If I'm doing well, then I can really serve the Lord.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:43.100]   Don't slap on our agenda to God's business and say we're doing fine.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.000]   That selfishness needs to die.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.160]   And what's really interesting is anytime I've seen an individual who's very selfish, anytime
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.800]   that I've seen an individual who's very arrogant about that kind of boast of life, I find incredible
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.040]   fear, which brings us to our second point.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.880]   The heart issue that lies beneath this disobedience, this first-degree disobedience, one predominant
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.300]   one seen in the passage is fear.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   Why do selfish people, why do arrogant people, why do they fear?
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.960]   It's because they have much to lose.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.680]   When you have much to lose, when you have agendas, when you have passions and ambitions,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:25.600]   then you have so much you can lose, and therefore you are absolutely afraid.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.040]   I imagine I start thinking about the person who is sitting in the congregation of the
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.960]   Israelites out there.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.120]   One of them probably asking like, "Hey guys, Moses is not coming back.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.720]   I thought he'd come back at the end of the day."
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.280]   The next day goes by, it's like, "He's not back yet."
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.320]   And some of us are worry wards.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.840]   I'm actually a worry ward too.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   I worry a lot.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   "What are we going to do?
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.280]   What are we going to do?"
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.440]   By day three, someone probably asks like, "Dude, did you see Moses carry a lunch bag?
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.320]   He didn't have no food, man.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.440]   Did you see Joshua carry a water canteen?
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.800]   They don't even have water."
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.920]   So the worry ward in you says, "Oh my God, I think they're dead."
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.640]   And then other individuals are probably like, "Oh no, what if he abandoned us?
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.600]   Did you know fear also lies?
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.720]   Just like selfish desire lies, so does fear."
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.680]   Fear starts saying, "He's not coming back.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.320]   It's been one week."
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.920]   By the second week, "He's abandoned us.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.400]   And has God abandoned us."
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.120]   And then by the fourth week, it's like, "We don't even know where he is."
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.120]   That's a lie.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.120]   You know exactly where he is.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   You just don't see him, but he's right there at the mountain.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   God called him up.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.640]   You know where he is.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.720]   And God told you to wait.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.440]   But fear lies.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.040]   You know what scripture says in the book of Proverbs, "The man who fears says, 'Lions
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.040]   and bears.'"
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   They're out there, man.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.560]   Lions or bears are everywhere.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.800]   Fear lies all the time.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.920]   Fear makes us do all kinds of silly stuff.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.960]   And by way of application, this is the thing that I'm talking about.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.200]   If you fear, you will disobey.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.160]   I take some opportunity sometimes when I'm on the pulpit to confess to you honestly.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.640]   I struggle with fear quite a lot.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.920]   And I share this with the elders, and I share it with you if you talk to me personally.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.120]   I as a pastor, I fear failure.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.400]   I fear failing God, and I fear failing you, and I especially fear failing my own leaders.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.400]   I do.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.920]   I'm just being honest.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.000]   What's more, I fear certain things that are more just subjective to me.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   I fear looking stupid in front of you.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.280]   When I don't know what to say, when I don't know what to do, and I just put up my hands,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.080]   I fear looking dumb.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.400]   Can I be honest with you?
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.240]   I fear that a lot.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.600]   But if I allow that to rest in my mind and rest in my heart, I will always disobey God.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.720]   So if an individual is sitting there saying, "Well, I just have to stop doing this stuff.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.200]   I just have to stop doing this stuff."
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.560]   But he doesn't deal with the fear, he will never obey.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.200]   You see what I'm saying now, right?
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.880]   He will never obey.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:56.600]   And fear is one of those things that makes us do all kinds of silly stuff.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.080]   It doesn't even make sense.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.520]   We hide in trenches.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.520]   We lie.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.520]   Do you know what Aaron says?
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.920]   Moses comes down and says, "What did you do?"
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.440]   And Aaron's like, "You know these people, these people are wicked.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   They gave me their gold.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.360]   I put it in the fire and boop, this calf came out."
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   Read this story later.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.040]   For the sake of time, I read it in the first service and then I went really, really long.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.280]   For the sake of time, read it on your own time.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.280]   It's hilarious.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.560]   Aaron's like, "Yeah, I just put it in there and then it just came out."
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.680]   I was like, "Wow, Aaron."
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.160]   But when you're afraid of the people, you're afraid of the people.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.720]   You're afraid of the people, you're afraid of Moses too.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   And so what do you do?
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.160]   You lie.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.240]   You lie.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.640]   Fear is at the heart of sin.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   He was flustered.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   He didn't know what to do.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.240]   He didn't know who to consult and he just did whatever they told him.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.500]   And his fear then is closely tied with the next thing.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.800]   You distrust God.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:58.260]   Fear is closely tied with desire, but it's also closely tied with distrust.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.360]   And all three of those things, desire, fear, and distrust, all feed each other.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.800]   They just feed each other into this ginormous monster.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.240]   And so typically when you find an individual who has great passions and lust, you find
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.840]   them pretty arrogant.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.640]   You find them not trusting God.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.240]   And then that also feeds their continued desire because ultimately you're going to trust one
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   or the other.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.800]   You're going to either trust yourself or you're going to trust God.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.280]   But when you're in a moment where you feel like you're in survival mode, like, "I just
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.400]   need to do something," you're not going to trust God.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.780]   So my third and final heart issue that we want to tackle today, this morning, is the
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.620]   distrust of God that the people have.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:40.060]   The audacity for them to say, "Let's make a God who'll go before us."
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.740]   Like he didn't before?
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.900]   How dare you?
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.180]   From before you were even born, he was leading your path.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.060]   He was making you into a great nation.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:59.420]   How dare you distrust God and say, "Let's make one who'll actually go before us."
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.240]   It's crazy what the people are thinking.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.780]   The people are thinking, "I don't even know of this guy."
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.540]   The pastor says, "This man, Moses."
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.860]   They don't trust Moses anymore?
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.020]   And I don't think they ever actually did.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.980]   They don't.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.980]   How could they?
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.900]   The Bible passages are sloaned with just, "Moses, who are you?
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.420]   Does God only speak to you?
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.420]   Why do we have to follow you?
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.420]   Who are you?"
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.420]   They're asking constantly.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.380]   "You were just a shepherd guy who was out in the wilderness.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.060]   You killed people and you're not even leaving all of us.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.060]   You're from that palace.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.060]   What are you?"
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.940]   They doubt him and they doubt his God.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.220]   They doubt the Lord.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:43.140]   So an application right now for us, we have to deal with the hard issues of desire, fears,
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.260]   and distrust.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:50.460]   If you live in any one of these hard issues, you will never obey.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.460]   Think about this.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.740]   Imagine if I was an absolute stranger to you.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.500]   You just walking down the street and I show up to you like this.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.060]   I typically don't even wear these things.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.780]   My son got it for me.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.780]   But I'm all in a suit today.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.700]   Now so you just automatically think, "What are you doing, man?"
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.100]   And I come to you and say, "Put out your hand.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.340]   I have something to give you.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.460]   What are you going to do?"
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.460]   "No."
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:17.100]   You're just going to look at me and be like, "No."
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.100]   Because why?
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.100]   You don't trust me.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.700]   You don't know me.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:25.260]   I'm just a guy in a suit probably trying to sell you something.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.260]   Right?
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.660]   When you do not trust, you are not going to open your hand.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.460]   When you do not trust, you're not going to do anything.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.980]   We operate like this all the time.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.820]   And the challenge for us today is to trust the Lord with everything we've got because
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.940]   he's absolutely trustworthy.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.700]   I just started this sermon with, "Look at what God has been doing in amazing fashion
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.540]   and I wish there was even better terms."
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.300]   God was profoundly faithful, good, loving, kind.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.780]   He was an amazing Father giving them everything.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.400]   But they don't trust him.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.700]   And that's the challenge at heart today.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.340]   Please turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 4.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:07.620]   Contrary to example of distrust, Apostle Paul gives us an example of trust in the person
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.620]   of Abraham.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.900]   Romans chapter 4 verses 18 through 22.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.020]   Elder Joe read it for us this morning before the worship set and it was a perfect one for
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:23.420]   us to think about trusting in God from the heart that we would not be led down the path
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.020]   of first degree disobedience.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:33.500]   Romans chapter 4 says this, starting from verse 18, "In hope against hope."
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.940]   In hope against hope.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.700]   You see, I get it.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.340]   When the people looked down, what did they see?
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.100]   They saw dirt.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.740]   When they looked around, what did they see?
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.060]   Scared people everywhere.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.340]   When they looked up, what did they see?
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.940]   Mountain on fire.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.540]   I would be afraid too, genuinely.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:56.260]   And I would wonder, "Oh my goodness, our founding father guy, our Moses, our leader
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.260]   is not even here."
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:03.660]   But in that moment, what they should have done is exercise spiritual hope in God when
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.980]   there was hopelessness on the earth that they stood.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:12.280]   But Abraham, it says, "In hope against hope, he believed so that he might become a father
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.380]   of many nations according to that which had been spoken.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.380]   So shall your descendants be."
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.300]   God gave the promise of his word.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.420]   I'm going to bless you and make you a great nation.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.940]   So then, verse 19, "Without becoming weak in faith, he contemplated his own body."
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:30.940]   Abraham looked down.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.900]   He looked down and said, "Yup, about to die."
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.180]   And then it says that he looked now as good as death since he was about 100 years old
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.620]   and the deadness of Sarah's womb.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.580]   He looked at his wife and she's always been barren.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:49.900]   But hope against the hope, the hopelessness of this world.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.480]   It says, "Abraham, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:00.100]   strong in faith, giving glory to God and being fully assured of what God had promised.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.060]   He was able to also perform.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:07.860]   Therefore, it was also credit to him as righteousness."
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.740]   The solution against every kind of idolatry, the solution of every kind of sin that we
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.420]   do is not just the action of, "Stop it.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.420]   Knock it off.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.220]   I just need to stop."
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.940]   It's ingrained in your heart, do you trust God?
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.700]   And unless you come to a point where besides what you see, besides what you're convinced
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:30.260]   of, besides the lack, deficiency, whatever that you're experiencing, the hurt and the
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:35.980]   pains, you need to be able to say, "I trust God that he will deliver.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:36.980]   I trust his word.
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.980]   I trust his character.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.980]   I trust his history, his past.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.900]   I trust everything about him.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.380]   So that in this moment when I stand at the foot of the mountain, I wish I was up at the
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.900]   top, but right now I'm at the foot.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.020]   I trust you, God."
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.840]   That is to us our righteousness, amen?
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.340]   That is to us God's expectation.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:03.340]   That is to us actual spiritual success when we in faith hold true to the confession, "God
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.940]   is good," even now at the bottom of the mountain.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.500]   This is absolutely necessary, you see?
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.780]   This is necessary for the solutions of our own faith where we are then guarded against
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:20.380]   pride, arrogance, where we're guarded against sin and all kinds of heinous before God.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.420]   But this last point I want to make really emphatically.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:28.180]   It is absolutely important for us to dissect the sins, to look at the hard issues, to make
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.860]   sure we do an absolute thorough job.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   Why?
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:37.460]   Not just so that we can find a solution for our sins, but because if in any way we diminish
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.660]   what our sin is, we make God a liar.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.860]   Let me repeat.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:50.900]   If we in any way do not see our sin for what it is, if we in any way diminish what we've
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.900]   done in our sin, we make God a liar.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.460]   Scripture says, "If we say we have no sin, we lie.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.740]   We lie against the truth and we make him a liar."
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.740]   How?
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.260]   Because if we gloss over it and say, "I get it.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.260]   Everyone would.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.900]   In that scenario, I would too."
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.900]   And then we flip it.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:15.500]   Truthfully speaking, yes, if I was in that scenario, I would probably be dismayed too.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.260]   But if in any way we gloss over it without looking at the depth of sin, then now all
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.460]   of a sudden God's wrath doesn't make sense.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.460]   My anger burns.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.380]   Leave me alone that I would destroy you.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.380]   For what, God?
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.780]   You don't understand?
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.100]   I was scared.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.420]   Do you know, we don't have time to go over it, but later on, read the whole chapter.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:39.620]   God tells Moses, "Tell the people of my men who are on my side, everybody who is a
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.220]   Levite who is on my side, come.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.220]   They all come."
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.980]   He said, "Take your sword, put it on your side, now walk and kill your brother, your
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.020]   father, your friend."
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:53.140]   Thousands of men died that day for their sin.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:40:00.620]   If we say all we did is make a mistake, circumstantial failure, then we make God unjust.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.620]   You see that, right?
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.420]   But let me make this case for you.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.420]   The sins that were committed against God in this scenario is so much more than meets the
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.820]   eye.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:16.300]   If any one of us was a ruler, if any one of us was an Aaron or Moses or even a superpower
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.100]   that we were ruling, we would have been so fed up with these people, we would have killed
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.100]   them all.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   That's my personal conviction.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.940]   Let me prove that to you a little bit, of the things that they did.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:32.820]   For example, Scripture makes mention of how quickly God says, "Moses, go down, look at
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:37.820]   these people, I've seen them, how quickly do they turn?"
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.380]   Think about it in context.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.260]   God was not forced to come and make any covenant with these people.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:52.660]   And this covenant was so severe, severe as in so strict, so weighty and solemn, there
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.780]   was blood.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.940]   There was an actual counting of, "This is who I am, this is who you are, and let's repeat
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.580]   the covenant stipulations."
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.980]   What does that sound like to you?
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.460]   A marriage ceremony.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:11.420]   What they did is apropos to a man looking at his bride and saying, "I love you, I'll
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:16.820]   always be there for you until death do us part, baby," walks down the aisle, turns
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.060]   the corner and kisses another woman.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.180]   That's this scenario.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.020]   Does God not have the right to eradicate these people?
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.060]   What's more, think about what Aaron does when he says, "Listen guys, we're going to make
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:36.780]   this calf, here is your God, Elohim, majestic Lord.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.420]   He's brought you out."
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:44.500]   To a credit to this figurine, what God Almighty has done, you don't think God would be offended?
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:49.140]   A people He's given them His good law and His presence, where He said, "Make a tabernacle
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.980]   for me, make a sanctuary for me."
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.980]   Because why?
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.700]   Because we want to dwell with you.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:42:01.060]   And then to have the audacity to mimic what God was doing with that, God desires to have
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.380]   peace with us, so He gives them sacrifice.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.780]   God wants us to remember Him, so He gives us feasts.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:11.180]   And then to use that for their self-agenda, "Guess what guys, tomorrow we'll feast."
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.180]   Like wink.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.540]   You know, think of something else.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:22.380]   Do you know how a bunch of slaves in the wilderness had gold to make a calf?
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.980]   That was God's sovereign provision.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:29.180]   God commanded Moses, "When you leave, turn to the Egyptian neighbor and says, 'Give me
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:33.460]   your treasure, your gold and silver, that I might worship God.'
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:39.340]   And miraculously, all these Egyptians who hated these shepherds said, 'Oh yeah, please
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.340]   leave.'"
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:48.340]   That was God's sovereign provision for worship, to laden His tabernacle with gold.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.940]   And He ripped them off of the years of His women, His daughters, and said, "Let's make
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.660]   a calf."
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.260]   Think about this.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.180]   Would you not be enraged?
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:06.080]   Now, to me then, when I read the Old Testament, God is not a God full of wrath.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.340]   We are a people full of sin.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:13.220]   And what God is, is He is patient.
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:20.380]   If we are disobedient to the first degree, God is patient to the nth degree.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.380]   Amen?
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.540]   I can't fathom the measure of His grace and His patience when we look at how sinful their
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.900]   actions have been.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.820]   I just can't fathom that.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:36.900]   It's wild and mind-blowing to think about the fact that God in this moment, He says,
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.380]   "Let me alone, that my anger would burn."
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.420]   And Moses said, "Please."
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.140]   And God says, "Then I relent."
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.700]   We are not going to get into a theological argument about God's sovereignty, what He
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.460]   knows, whether He bends His will.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:58.620]   We are going to say this, "God Almighty is a God who relents of His anger for your sake."
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.220]   That's amazing.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.660]   Now let me ask you a question.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.980]   We have to trust God, do you?
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.980]   This amazing God is so faithful, even in this moment at the end of the chapter, He looks
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.700]   at Moses and says, "Moses, now go.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.180]   Now go and go before these people and lead them into the land I promised."
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.180]   Why?
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.340]   "Because I am faithful and I will send my angel before you."
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.500]   That's crazy.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.100]   Because we know through history, God not only sends His angel, He sends His servants, He
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.020]   sends His prophets, and then ultimately He sends His greatest prophet and servant, His
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.660]   very Son, Jesus Christ, to die for who?
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:43.020]   These people, who at the core of their heart don't trust His goodness.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.980]   That's why it might be understandable if I go to you and say, "Trust me.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.020]   Put out your hand so I can give you something."
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.020]   But it is sin to not trust the holy God who's been this faithful.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.920]   If anything, our challenge today is not to simply look upon this sin, but once we look
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.860]   upon this sin, the challenge is clear.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.140]   We need to work here.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.140]   Wickedness is not out there.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.140]   The temptation is not up there.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.140]   It's not over there.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.140]   It's not with him.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.140]   It's not with her.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.140]   It's right here.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.860]   And that wickedness is distrust of God.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:20.700]   May we see God as the most trustworthy thing in the universe and have confidence in Him
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.700]   for everything.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.700]   Amen?
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.700]   Let's pray.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:36.600]   Heavenly Father, we take a moment now to bow our hearts and say to you, "Thank you,
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.120]   thank you, thank you."
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.440]   Your love is unmeasurable.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.780]   Your patience with no bounds.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:48.880]   Scripture says you're a steadfast God, steadfast in your loving kindness.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.320]   And God, we see a glimpse of it today.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:57.300]   In the face of such outright rebellion, you are a relenting, faithful God.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.100]   Help us, Father God, to understand, Lord, what it means to trust you.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:07.700]   Help us, Father God, to understand that although sometimes maybe we've even thought and selfishly,
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:13.120]   sinfully thought that words like, "You just need to trust in the Lord," does not work.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:19.360]   Help us, Father God, to repent of our disbelief and to trust you and hope in you against all
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.600]   hope.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   We thank you, Lord.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:22.760]   Amen.
