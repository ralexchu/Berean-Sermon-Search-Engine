[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   Yes?
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.980]   Yeah.
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.480]   OK.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.460]   All right.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920]   Well, again, it's just been a pleasure being amongst family.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.960]   That's just what it is for me on this weekend.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.280]   I just hear already the way the Lord is just speaking
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.440]   and ministering to you guys.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.080]   It's just a blessing to my soul.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.960]   Again, I think I mentioned last time, one of the things
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.600]   that James and Valerie sent me was a list of things
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.760]   that I like, and I wrote down Korean barbecue.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.600]   That's one of my favorite foods.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   And so you guys are great.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.560]   Kettle chips.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.800]   I also said that I like kettle chips.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   Why did they find Korean barbecue flavored kettle
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   chips?
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.720]   I have never seen that before in my life,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.640]   and I love those things.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.080]   It's so good.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.120]   They got me my Kavitas with probiotic in it.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.800]   They got me my protein shakes.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.320]   So no, speaking of my legs, I'm a snack guy.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.200]   I love eating.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.520]   So I want food for sure.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240]   So it's just been good.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.800]   And I know some of you guys that may not know me
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.760]   or wonder why I look like I'm 20 years old.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.960]   They have a saying in the black community,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.640]   and I added Asian to it.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.720]   Black don't cry, and Asian don't raise them.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.600]   That's what it is, man.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.080]   So I'm wearing a Benjamin Button as a knee.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.000]   So I'm just glad to, again, be with you guys.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.320]   So let's go before the Lord in prayer before we begin.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.680]   God, the topic that you have us discussing today
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.440]   is one that is vitally important to our understanding of just
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.960]   how glorious you are.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.800]   And God, more than anything, I just
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.760]   don't want us to miss that.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.640]   God, you tell us that all things were made through you
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.440]   and for you.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.120]   And even the thing, God, that we are going to talk about today
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.400]   was made for you to point us to you,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.080]   to help us to encounter and experience you.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.120]   So God, I pray that our perspectives
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.800]   will be forever different today, enabling us, Lord God,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.640]   to consume more of your glory and the joy of our souls.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.680]   So Holy Spirit of God, will you please
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.320]   communicate in a way that only you can to the soul
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.360]   and allow for your word to come alive
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.040]   in our minds and our hearts?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.800]   We pray this, God, in Jesus' name.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.640]   Everybody said?
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.880]   Amen.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880]   Amen.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.040]   Amen.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.360]   If you will, please turn with me in your Bibles
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.400]   to 1 Corinthians, chapter 6.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.680]   1 Corinthians, chapter 6.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:24.960]   When I was probably a kid, there was this song,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.360]   and most of you guys probably don't even know what it is
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.880]   or have ever heard of it.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.080]   It was this hip hop song by this rapper called Salt and Pepper.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.200]   Anybody ever heard of Salt and Pepper before?
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.400]   So he had this song called, let's talk about sex, baby.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   Let's talk about you and me.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.200]   Let's talk about all the good things and the bad things
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.680]   that are going to be.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680]   Let's talk about sex.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   That's what we're going to talk about right now.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   Y'all ready?
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.640]   OK.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.120]   All right.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.600]   So if you have children in here, or you've
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.080]   let your kids in here, please, if you could dismiss them.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.560]   This may not be appropriate for them.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.520]   And yeah, this is an area of our relationships and marriage
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   that a lot of times we don't want to talk about.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   How many times have you guys talked about sex in marriage?
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.020]   Yes?
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.520]   No?
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yes?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   OK.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.500]   All right.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.000]   Well, it's a vital part of your relationship,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.480]   and it's important that we talk about it,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   because a lot hinges on just what
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   it means for you guys to live out your calling in marriage
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   through sex.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   So today, many of you sex, as we already
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   know in our society and our culture,
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.960]   has an appetite like food.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.440]   It's impossible, if you will, to live without sex.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   And there is no reason why we shouldn't
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.440]   be able to sample various varieties of sex,
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   like cuisine continually having what Keller called
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.440]   new taste sensations.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.440]   Our culture is infatuated with it.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.440]   This vision of sex in our culture is not new.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.920]   Thousands of years ago, in a city called Corinth,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.920]   they had a very similar vision when it came to sex.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   And so I'm going to have us actually stand
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   as we read the word of God in 1 Corinthians,
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   starting in chapter 6, verse 12.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.400]   "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   All things are lawful for me, but I will not
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   be dominated by anything.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   and God will destroy both one and the other.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   The body is not meant for sexual immorality,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   And God raised the Lord and will also
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   raise us up by his power.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   Shall I then take the members of Christ
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   and make them members of a prostitute?
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   Or do you not know that he who is joined into a prostitute
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   becomes one body with her?
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   For as it is written, the two will become one flesh.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   Flee from sexual immorality.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   Every other sin a person commences outside the body.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   But the sexual immoral person sins against his own body.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   Or do you not know that your body is
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   whom you have from God?
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   You are not your own, but you are born with a price.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   So glorify God in your body.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   Now concerning the matters about which you vote,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   it is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   But because of the temptation to sexual immorality,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   each man should have his own wife,
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   and each woman her own husband.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   Thus ends the reading of the word of the living God.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   You may be seated.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   Now what Paul says in verse 12,
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.400]   "All things are lawful for me."
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   He's actually quoting a Corinthian slogan
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   that the Corinthian Christians had adopted
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   to rationalize sex their way.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   Paul expounds upon this attitude by quoting
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   another Corinthian slogan that we see in verse 13 of chapter 6.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   "Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food."
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   Now this slogan here basically communicated the idea
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   that the body should be permitted to have anything that it craves.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.400]   So they did sex their way.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   Prostitution in Corinth was not only legal,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   it was actually a religious encounter,
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   as temples had a guide for sex.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   And they would actually have prostitutes that would line the streets.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   And it was more than acceptable for a Corinthian man
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   to marry for social status,
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   while having a little something, if you will, on the side.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   And the Corinthian church here was beginning to buy
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   into that culture of sex.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   Now this lack of sexual restraint that we see
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   calls for some of the Corinthian church
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   to swing to the other extreme,
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   that meaning basically you can't have sex of any kind,
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   even within marriage.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   That sex was to be avoided entirely.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.400]   So it was actually more glorious, if you will,
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   and you were actually more in line with God
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   if you didn't participate in it at all.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   And as we can see in chapter 7, verse 1,
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   "Now concerning the matters about which you wrote,
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.400]   it is good for a man to not have sexual relations with a woman."
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   So here you see him addressing just that.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   Now wait a minute.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   Didn't God ultimately create sex?
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   And if we are going to image, reflect Him,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   then there must be something about sex and its creation
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   that images or reflects ultimately God.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   He intended ultimately to reveal His glories to us
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   in creation, in all that He had made.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   All things were made through Him and for Him,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   including sex.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   And so I want us to see three things today.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   First, what makes sex so glorious?
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   Second, how should we handle such a glorious gift?
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   How should we handle this gift?
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   And then thirdly, what does it reveal about God
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   that should cause us to hunger more for Him?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   What does sex reveal about God that should create
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   a desire and a passion, not necessarily for one another,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   but for God Himself?
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   So now let's see two glorious visions of sex.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   What makes sex so glorious?
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   We'll look at two visions of it.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   1 Corinthians 6, starting at verse 15 and 16.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   The first glorious vision.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   members of a prostitute?
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   Never.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   becomes one body?
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   Everybody say one body.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   One body.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   With her.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   For as it is written, and now he goes back to Genesis,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   the two will become one flesh.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   Now, verses 15 all the way down through 17,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   because he goes on to say that he who is joined to the Lord
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   becomes one spirit with him, is called a syllogism
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   from verses 15 through 17.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   And Paul here is giving a three-part argument
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   with two premises and a conclusion that ultimately follows.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   So premise number one, the bodies of Christians
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   are members of Christ Himself.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   So the bodies of Christians are members of Christ Himself.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   So you are an actual member of Christ.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   What you do with your body is exemplary of him.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   That's why it's so critical that God says,
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   Be holy as I am holy, because what we demonstrate
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   in the world is an extension of who he is.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   Premise number two is in verse 16.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   Sex unites two human beings.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   So sex in the act of it, it brings a unity or a oneness.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   So the first glorious vision that we see here of sex
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   that God reveals to us is, here it is,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.400]   sex laces us to one another.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   Sex laces us to one another.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   Paul here is quoting from Genesis chapter 2, verse 24,
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   defining sex as one flesh.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   Now when God created Eve out of Adam,
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.400]   when he took the rib in half and he built Adam into Eve,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   they became one person.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.400]   Now we talked about this in my first message.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   What did oneness ultimately look like in that context?
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   Well, one, they both shared the same image, God.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   They both shared the same flesh, Adam's rib.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   They both had the same position, dominion.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   And they both shared the same resources, the garden.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   They both shared the same purpose, be fruitful and multiply.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   But that's not the only area of oneness.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   One flesh refers to the personal union of a woman and a man at all levels.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   So then watch this.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   After creation, of all these oneness demonstrations that I just articulated,
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   God creates verse 24 of Genesis 2,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   and he gives them an explicit graphic illustration of the depth of their oneness.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.400]   After all these other onenesses, he ends by saying,
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   "And the two shall become one flesh."
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   Now we can see it almost in Adam's response in verse 23,
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   as you hear the first--he becomes the first hip-hop artist ever to walk the planet.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   He just starts rapping.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   I mean, for you ladies, we'll say he started doing poetry.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   That'll make it a little more romantic.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   "This is flesh of my flesh, yeah, and bone of my bone."
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   When he comes and sees Eve, it's like, "What? Are you kidding me?"
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   We can paraphrase what Paul is saying here in this way, in Corinth.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   Don't you know that the purpose of sex is always one flesh?
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   To become united to another person in every area of life
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   is that you are seeking that in a prostitute?
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   That's what he's saying.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   You're seeking that in a prostitute? Of course not.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   So don't have sex with her,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   because ultimately, sex is a blending and a bonding of two individuals into one,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   and it culminates oneness.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   That's why God ends in verse 24 of Genesis chapter 2
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   by saying, "And the two shall become one flesh."
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   We know that because here he uses that as the analogy for flesh--for sex.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   Paul says, "The two will become one flesh."
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:03.400]   So verse 24 of Genesis chapter 2 is talking about sex, among other things.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   There's no more pronounced way to communicate that sex is one flesh
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   than the byproduct of sex.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   What's the byproduct of sex?
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.400]   Children, right?
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   When a child is born, it's one individual that's been blended in by two.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   There are people who look at my daughter and they'll say,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   "Man, she is your twin. That's your twin."
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   When they look at one of my other daughters and they'll look at Mom,
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   they'll say, "Man, she looks just like you."
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.400]   Or, "Does she look like me or does she look like her?"
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.400]   "No, she looks like the both of us."
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   Only when they act up, then I'm like, "That's your son."
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.400]   You see him over there? That's your daughter.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   That wasn't from my side of the family.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   If there's more to one flesh, there's more to this than the one flesh of sex.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   There exists an intangible, mysterious, spiritual lacing that occurs in lovemaking.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   We instinctively, even if the Bible didn't even tell us,
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   we know that at the core, sex cements us.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   It's in the midst of sexual passion that you naturally want to say things like,
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   "I will always be with you forever."
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   It's in the midst of that that you say, "I want to be with you forever."
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   If someone goes out and does it with someone else, what do you feel?
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   You feel betrayed. You feel cheated on.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   You feel devalued.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   So, sex is glorious.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   One, because it laces us.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   It is the actual culmination of what I talked about in my first message
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   when it comes to oneness.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   Now let us see the second glorious vision of sex from God's perspective.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   Secondarily, sex is intimate knowledge.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   It's intimate knowledge.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   You see, sex from God's vantage point is very different.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.400]   Many of you are familiar with maybe, I don't know, you've heard of the common kind of colloquial phrase
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   that we use in conversations when we say, "Yada."
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   Like, "We played ball, we swam in the river, shelled oysters, yada, yada, yada,
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   and then we went home."
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   Have you heard of that before? That colloquial phrase?
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   When your husband asks you what you did at the ball,
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   you say, "Well, you know, we kind of took the kids over to the train,
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   and then we had a little bit of food, and then we just yada, yada, yada, did all of that."
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   Then when the credit card bill comes, the rest of the yada kind of starts showing up.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   You don't want to tell me that.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   Well, yada means much more, actually, than that.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   It's very interesting.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   And I think the great theologian Seinfeld will actually give us a better picture
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   or an idea of what yada means from God's perspective.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   So let's go ahead and take a look at that clip.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   So, I'm on third avenue. Mind you, I'm in business. Yada, yada, yada.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   I get a free massage and a facial.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   That's a six, Laura.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   I'm surprised you brought the camera.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   Are you close with your parents?
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   Well, they gave birth to me, and yada, yada.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   Yada what?
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.400]   Yada, yada, yada.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   We used to be married.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.400]   We bought the wedding invitations, and yada, yada, yada.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   I'm still single.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   So what's she doing now?
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   Yada.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   I guess I'm speaking of exes, Mom.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   My old boyfriend came over late last night.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   Yada, yada, yada.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   I'm really tired today.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   Listen to this.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   Margie comes over and she tells me that her ex-boyfriend was over late last night,
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   and yada, yada, yada, I'm really tired today.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   You don't think she'd yada, yada, six?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   I've yada, yada, six.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   Yeah. I met this lawyer. We went out to dinner.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   I had the lobster bisque. We went back to my place.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   Yada, yada, yada. I never heard from him again.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   Gee, yada, yada. I don't know about the lawyer.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   No, I mentioned the bisque.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   Well, I gotta do something.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.400]   Well, I gotta do something.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Do something.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   And you notice the way they used the word yada
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   to gloss over sexual encounters.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   Yada is actually a Hebrew word used for, guess what?
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   Sex.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   And the translation is actually a very stunning one.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   In Genesis chapter 4, verse 1,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   we see the word in Hebrew, yada, being actually used.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   Now Adam yada'd Eve, his wife,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   and she conceived and bore Cain,
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   saying, I've gotten a man with the help of the Lord.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   We see the second yada in verse 17.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   Cain yada'd his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   when he built a city.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   And then we see the third yada in verse 25.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   And Adam knew his wife, yada, and again,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   she bore a son. So there it is.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   Yada, yada, yada.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.400]   Verse 25 translates the word as what?
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.400]   What's the word there?
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   Knew, knew, knew.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   Yada is a Hebrew word that reveals that sex is much deeper
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   than a physical act.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   What it is, is it's intimate knowledge.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   Adam knew his wife.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   Now what's also interesting about that word
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   is that that word also comes into context meaning mercy.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.400]   Another occurrence of yada can be found in the Hebrew wisdom books
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   and is translated as mercy.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   In Proverbs chapter 12, verse 10,
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   the righteous knows, yada, the needs of their animals,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   but the mercy of the wicked is cruel.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   So you see the parallel there.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   The righteous knows the needs, but the mercy.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   So that's a parallel.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   So mercy is helping us to understand what the knowing is
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   in Proverbs chapter 12, verse 10.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   In other words, yada expresses intimate understanding of a need
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   like no one else does.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   And it lets that person know that you are committed
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   to taking care of that need.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   Sex says, I want to know you, know you.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   Adam knew his wife.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   I want to know you.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   Sex says, I'm committed to studying you.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   I want to know you through face-to-face encounters with you.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:58.400]   I'm committed to living for your needs and not my own.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   That's what sex was designed to communicate by God.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   There's one instance of a guy at our church.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   Actually, you guys, well, some of you guys know Charlie.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   Charlie used to attend here at the podium.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.400]   He's now over at our church.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   And if you know Charlie, he can sometimes get really close to you
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   when he's talking to you, and really uncomfortable close.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   It's like, man, get back up, dog.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   And I remember just one time him doing that to my wife,
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   and she got really uncomfortable.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   So intimate knowledge of sex is it's knowing someone so well
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   that you can finish their sentences.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   It's knowing someone so well, you're so close to them
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   that you can see the freckles on their nose.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.400]   It's knowing someone so well that you know when they hurt
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   and you know how to comfort them.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   You know their stink and their glories
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   and everything else in between.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   You see, the glory of sex is that it declares to all that you are known.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   Listen, the glory of sex is this.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   This is why it should be so exclusive.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   It's because it declares to everyone around you in the world
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   that you are known in ways that no one on earth will know you.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   That you have been let into places that only you will know.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   It is a declaration that I know you,
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   and I'm committed to knowing you more deeply for the rest of my life.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:44.400]   That's why God says it has to be exclusive.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   So the first glory of sex that we saw is that it laces us.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   The second is that it's intimate knowledge.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   Thirdly, sex belongs in the marriage bed.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   Sex belongs in the marriage bed.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   Back in 1 Corinthians 6, verse 16.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   "For do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   becomes one body with hers?
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   For as it is written, the two will become one flesh."
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   Verse 17, "But he who is joined to the Lord
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   becomes one spirit with him."
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   Flee from sexual immorality.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:37.400]   but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   Now here we begin to see the eternal glory and perspective of sex.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   In chapter 7, verse 2.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   "But because of temptation to sexual immorality,
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   each man should have his own wife,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   and each woman her own husband."
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   Keller says this. Let me ask you this.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   Does God give you intimacy apart from total commitment?
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   Is he okay with showering you with eternal pleasures
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.400]   when he asks for your total devotion?
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.400]   You say to him, "I don't want to get up in front of the world
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.400]   and declare that I'm completely yours and only yours."
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   You see, the parallel to the exclusivity of sex
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   is a demonstration of a call of exclusive devotion to God himself.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   You see, we are not the center for why God made sex.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   God is.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   And sex was made by him and for him.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   And we were ultimately made to reflect that design for sex
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   when we choose to do sex our way,
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:57.400]   we begin to muddy up, if you will, that image.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.400]   We don't do it God's way.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   We say to the person in our own relationship,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.400]   "I don't love you enough,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   and I'm willing to go and tie myself to someone else."
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   We declare to the world in that process
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   that, you know what, this is what a relationship to God looks like.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   Non-exclusive.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.400]   Just as ridiculous as it would be to say to God,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   "I want your intimacy," without commitment,
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   is just as ridiculous for us to talk about sex
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   outside of marital commitment.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   So, that's what sex ultimately tells us.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   Now my second question.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   How then are we to wield such a powerful gift from God?
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   I'm going to give you three ways.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.400]   Looking back at 1 Corinthians 7, we're going to go to verse 3.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   "The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights,
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   and likewise the wife to her husband.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   For the wife does not have authority over her own body,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   but the husband does.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body,
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.400]   but the wife does.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time,
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.400]   that you may devote yourself to prayer,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   but then come together again,
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   How are you to wield this gift?
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.400]   The first reason, the first way, is I live to please.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.400]   Everybody say, "I live to please."
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   Look at your spouse and say, "I live to please."
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   Sex and marriage is to be used to please the other and not self.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   That's what Paul is telling us here.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   Fulfill marital duties in verse 3.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   When it says, "Fulfill marital duties," you know what it literally means in verse 3?
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   It means, "Give back that which is owed."
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   Give back that which is owed.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   In verse 4, "Does not have authority over."
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   What does that say?
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.400]   That you are to surrender authority over your body to your spouse.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   Ah man, this is rough.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   This is not how things act in the world.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   Verse 5, he says, "Do not," what?
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   "Deprive."
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   You know what that means?
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   Stop defrauding.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:46.400]   That is, cheating someone else out of what is properly his or hers.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.400]   That's what Paul is saying.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.400]   That's very strong language.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.400]   And then he gives the exception.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.400]   One, if both partners agree.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:06.400]   In other words, number two, other than that, you are to live to please.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   Now here's something I want to say.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.400]   Sex and marriage should never be used as a bribe or a reward for good behavior.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.400]   Don't do that.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.400]   All right?
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   Some of you guys are smiling because I've had good behavior in sex.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   I've had it.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.400]   My wife says, "Honey, if you do this, you're a good boy now."
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   All right, cool, I'm doing that.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.400]   Okay?
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.400]   Marriage is about displaying the what?
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.400]   Gospel.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.400]   And when we do sex that way, what it does is communicate.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.400]   It works salvation.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   You see, in marriage, the posture should be this.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   I want to do all that I can to please you.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   Even when I'm not in the mood.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   If you desire to have me, then I'm yours.
