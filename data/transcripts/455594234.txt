[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Alright, Hebrews chapter 10 verses 26 through 31, let me read it in the NASB.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.480]   It says, "If we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.240]   truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a terrifying
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.040]   expectation of judgment of the fury of fire which will consume the adversaries.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.440]   Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on a testimony
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.200]   of two or three witnesses. How much severe punishment do you think we will
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.120]   deserve who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has regarded as unclean
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.400]   the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified and has insulted the
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.520]   spirit of grace? For we know him who said, 'Vengeance is mine and I will repay.'
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.200]   And again the Lord will judge his people. It is a terrifying thing to fall into
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.120]   the hands of the living God." Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.400]   wisdom, spiritual soberness, that we may have the capacity to understand
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.440]   not only your words but your very heart. May this time be glorifying to you and
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.360]   sanctifying to the church. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.640]   All right, let me get this fixed.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.320]   All right, so this text that we're looking at
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.640]   is the fourth of five warnings in the book of Hebrews.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.120]   And it's probably one of the heaviest warnings in the New Testament outside of
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.920]   Jesus' gospel itself where he is talking to the church and
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.360]   you know like the encouragement to stay focused and not to drift.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.680]   But in between these encouragements and warnings,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.720]   he uh encouragements about Christology and about
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.960]   supremacy of Christ above all the creation and all the old old system,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.040]   he always ends it by saying, "But if you do not pay attention,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.560]   if you hear my warning about uh about drifting
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.640]   and you just kind of take it lightly," he says, "here are the consequences." And then
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.280]   so this is the fourth and there's another warning that's coming up in
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.080]   later chapter. But this is probably the heaviest one.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   In fact, Jonathan Edwards, he doesn't base his
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.440]   sermon, "The sinners in the hands of an angry God" on this text, but he
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.840]   borrows the words in verse 31 where he says, "It is a fearful thing to
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.920]   to fall into the hands of a living God." And you probably heard of that that
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.120]   title even as a non-christian in high school. They study his sermon,
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.880]   "Sinners in the hands of an angry God." So the words are borrowed from
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.560]   this text, but the text that he was expositing is in Deuteronomy chapter 32.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.760]   You know, again, this is one of those texts that if you were preaching a
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.080]   topical sermon, you probably would never hear. Because
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.680]   this is one of those sermons that if you happen to just stroll into the church
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.840]   and hear a sermon on this text, you say, "Ah, he's a another one of those
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.240]   fire and brimstone preachers." In fact, I know some churches who have
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.680]   openly said that they would never preach on this because they don't want to
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.960]   discourage people. Life is hard enough as it is. We don't
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.680]   want people coming into church and being down and feeling
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.080]   heavy about their life and then going home discouraged.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.880]   In fact, some of you guys may know that there was a book written by a man named
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.440]   Robert Bell, "Love Wins." Some of you guys may have heard of that book before, but
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.720]   basically the book's premise is that hell does not fit into modern
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.280]   Christianity. And so his whole theme is to erase hell.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.520]   That we should just get rid of that doctrine because
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.720]   it is not palatable, it's not acceptable in our generation.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.280]   This is what he says, "Telling a story about a God who inflicts unrelenting
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.680]   punishment on people because they didn't do or say or believe the correct things
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.480]   in a brief window of time called life isn't a very good story."
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.680]   And the point that he was trying to make in that saying that that story is just
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.640]   not going to sell. You know, again, you and I live in a
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.680]   generation where church growth movement, basically books and
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.160]   articles and conferences have been given to how to attract the
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.720]   maximum number of people to church and how to run a church in such a
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.920]   way to keep as many people in the church as possible.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.440]   So within that framework, hell doesn't fit.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.320]   This type of teaching, this type of theology isn't going to be friendly
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.600]   to people who are coming to church. He goes on to say,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   "The belief that untold masses of people suffering forever doesn't bring God
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.080]   glory, at least in his mind. Restoration brings
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.320]   God glory, God's glory. Eternal torment does not. Reconciliation brings God's
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.960]   glory. Endless anguish does not. Renewal and
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.560]   return causes God's glory, God's greatness to shine through the
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.040]   universe. Never-ending punishment does not." And again, the whole premise of the
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.800]   book is because it doesn't bring God's glory in his mind,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   therefore it needs to be erased. Now consider that
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.680]   to the sermon that Jonathan Edwards gave which sparked a great awakening.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.120]   It brought revival not only to the United States or Europe,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.200]   you know, basically the modern world where Christianity was being practiced.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.440]   The sermons that they were giving was indicative of the sermon that he gives
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.280]   in "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God." So
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.360]   many of you may have heard that or read that before, but it wasn't unique to
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.640]   Jonathan Edwards. It was a type of preaching that brought revival during
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.160]   that period. And this is what he says, "Yea, there is nothing else that is to be
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.960]   given as a reason why you don't this very moment drop down into hell.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.280]   O sinner, consider the fearful danger you are in, 'tis a great furnace of wrath,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.680]   a wide and bottomless pit full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.280]   the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.560]   much against you as against many of the damned in hell.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.880]   You hang by a slender thread with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it,
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.160]   and ready every moment to singe it and burn it asunder,
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.080]   and you have no interest in any mediator, and nothing to lay hold to save
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.600]   yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.000]   wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.640]   ever have done, nothing that you can do to induce God to spare you one moment."
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.560]   And his sermon goes on and on and on like this. Probably what I just read to
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.120]   you is probably 1/20th of his sermon, and majority of his sermon, the content
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.320]   is heavy like this. And they give credit to this sermon
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.880]   that sparked the great awakening, a revival. Imagine if this sermon was
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.840]   preached today, the response that would be given.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.200]   In fact, not that long ago I was trying to talk to
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.120]   a non-believer, and I, you know, he's a guy who fell away from faith, and
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.320]   and I asked him, "What caused you to fall, and what
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.880]   keeps you from coming to church?" And he said, "You know what, I don't want to go
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.040]   to a church where they're preaching condemnation and fire and brimstone. You
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   know, I hate that stuff, and so I'm not going to go, you know."
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.760]   But sad to say that's a common sentiment of many people.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.520]   And even sadder, that's a common sentiment of many people
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.040]   inside the church, where I've heard pastors actually say
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.080]   that we would never preach this, that our sermons are always encouraging,
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.840]   that our sermons will never feel cause you to be condemned or feel
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.240]   feel heavy. We're always going to focus on you feeling encouraged
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.680]   after the sermon. Now again, that pastor
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.720]   has not committed himself to an accurate teaching of the Word of God.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.400]   You cannot look at scripture and say, "I like this passage, and I don't like this
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.480]   passage. This makes sense, this doesn't make sense.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.520]   This is going to cause the church to grow, and this is going to cause people
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.360]   to move away from church, so therefore I will not do this or that."
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.960]   That person is no longer serving God, but man, he's serving himself.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.720]   It is not safe nor biblical to skim over certain passages in the
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.800]   scripture, because it is not palatable. Obviously,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.960]   the text that we are in is a heavy text. He has given warning, he's giving
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.080]   exhortation, but he says the consequence of not
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.240]   heeding the warning, he says this is what's coming.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.240]   Jesus himself said the severest description of judgment is given by
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.440]   Jesus himself. In Matthew 13, verse 41, they said, "There
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.160]   will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." In the book of Revelation, it describes the
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   second death as a lake of fire that cannot be extinguished.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.520]   You cannot accept the gospel of Jesus Christ and reject
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.960]   condemnation, because that is not the gospel.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.040]   You cannot take certain parts of the scripture and say, "This is what we want,"
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.760]   and kind of minimize the places of warning.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.360]   So this morning, I want to jump into this text. I know it's a heavy text
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.040]   for us to be in this morning, but it is absolutely necessary. I wish we,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.880]   I would be able to give more time to this, you know,
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.600]   but again, I want to make sure that at least for us that we understand why this
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.040]   is here and who this is speaking to. So there's three things that I
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.920]   want to cover in this text. There's one, who is he talking to?
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.080]   This is one of the harshest warnings that he gives
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.600]   that who is he talking to? So we want to identify that. And second,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.120]   why is he giving this warning? Why was it necessary for him
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.560]   to give this kind of warning? And then the third, what is the application of
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.160]   this? So who is he talking to? Why is he
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.440]   saying this? And third, what is the
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.520]   practical application for us? So first of all,
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.680]   the text where he says, where he ends by saying it's a terrifying thing to fall
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.000]   into the hands of the living God, right? He's not talking to a non-Christian
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.320]   outside the church. He's talking to people inside the church,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.160]   right? Because he's been telling the church who's been drifting, telling that
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.400]   we should not forsake assembling together.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.720]   He's not talking to people who are outside who openly deny Christ.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.840]   He's talking to people who are drifting and just kind of
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.880]   drifting back into the Judaistic and old system.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.640]   You know what's confusing though? In verse 29 he says,
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   at the end, that by which he was sanctified.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.240]   He's warning these people, but he describes them at one point was
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.640]   sanctified. So some people have confused this to say,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.560]   he must be talking to Christians that if they drift and they don't walk right
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.040]   with God, that they're going to lose their salvation
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.400]   because of the language that is being used here.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.120]   The language here, the word sanctified, is not referring to a Christian. In fact,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.960]   in other parts of the New Testament, Paul says in Corinthians
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.760]   about not leaving your unbelieving husband,
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.160]   because he may be sanctified. And the word sanctified doesn't mean that
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.520]   if a non-Christian, if you had two couples and one of them become Christian,
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.640]   the other one will be saved. Clearly that's not what he is saying.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.760]   The word sanctified just literally means to be set
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.240]   apart. Now when that is used for justification, we're talking about
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.440]   salvation. But generally the term simply means to
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.880]   be set apart. So the way that Paul uses it in Corinthians,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.560]   he's saying that if a, if a individual who wasn't a Christian becomes a
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.440]   Christian, to not to simply walk away from an
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.960]   unbeliever, because that unbeliever is set apart
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.920]   because there's a Christian influence in the home.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.120]   Just like a non-Christian, if he enters into the church,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.560]   he is also set apart because he, he or she
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.600]   is being exposed to the gospel. That he is,
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.720]   he is around, he's not like the unbelievers who are just walking around.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.120]   That because the church has been sanctified, has been set apart,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.120]   that it may become the body of Christ. So when an individual is in the church,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.120]   in a sense he is also set apart. So that's what he means by
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.800]   sanctified. Somebody who is inside the church.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.120]   So this warning is given to those people who have the privilege
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.360]   of being in the church, is hearing the word of God regularly,
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.960]   has common experience with genuine believers,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.480]   maybe they even have gone out to missions and come back, maybe even
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.800]   teaching Sunday school. They have common experience because they
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.920]   are inside the church. That's what he means by sanctified. In fact,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:23.120]   a very similar idea is mentioned in Hebrews 6, 4 through 6.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.160]   "For in the case of those who have once been enlightened
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.440]   and have tasted the heavenly gifts," right? Enlightened meaning
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.720]   that they heard the gospel and they understood it.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.240]   "Tasted the heavenly gift," meaning that they were in the context of
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.440]   of a body of Christ where God's blessing is surrounding them. So they tasted
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.040]   right, the heavenly gift. They were partakers of the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.720]   They were partakers in the sense that they in the corporate body of
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.840]   Christ where the Holy Spirit is blessing. Holy
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.360]   Spirit mightily working and they're in the context of that.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.880]   Not that they personally have the Holy Spirit, but they are partakers of the
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.240]   work of the Holy Spirit. "And have tasted the good word of God
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.640]   and the power of the age to come and then have fallen away. It is impossible to
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.120]   renew them and again to repentance." Meaning that they
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.240]   had every opportunity. The word of God was
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.760]   given to them. They had pastors. They were inside the
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.080]   church and yet they say they willfully drift
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.000]   away from God. So this is not somebody who is
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.480]   struggling. He's willful, it says. In fact,
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:35.760]   verse 26, the word that they use for knowledge is "epinosis." The regular word
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.520]   for knowledge is "gnosis." Gnosis basically
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.480]   means knowledge. When you add the word "epi" in front of it,
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.880]   it means to intensify. So when he says that this individual
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.160]   received epinosis of the truth, meaning he's received everything that is
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.920]   necessary, he's not the way he is because he had
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.680]   partial understanding. He's not the way he is because he didn't
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.840]   understand. He wasn't taught. There was a partial and misunderstanding
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.320]   of the gospel. He said he has everything he needs to know
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:12.560]   fully and yet he is willfully walking away from the truth. He chooses to go
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.640]   down that path knowing that this is contrary.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.920]   He says that this is an individual who is living in sin,
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.400]   not necessarily struggling with sin. Okay, so let me make that
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:30.560]   distinction very clear. Living in sin and struggling with sin.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.040]   Because a lot of people who are living in sin
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.960]   describe their lives as struggling. Struggle means
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   that there is a struggle. There is a wrestling to repent,
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.120]   to put away their old life, to continue to walk in righteousness,
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.560]   to openly confess. There is a struggling towards sin.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.120]   But there are people who are living in sin. They have embraced that life
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:59.520]   and they see the grace of God simply as a free ticket to get out of hell.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.800]   And that's all the gospel is to them. And so
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.720]   one saved always saved. There's nothing you can do to please God because God
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.320]   saved us by grace and grace alone. And it is not by words. So they have all
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.040]   of these cliche things that they have memorized
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.640]   and yet they are living in darkness. There is a great difference between
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.680]   living in sin and struggling with sin. And 1 John describes
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.040]   that in 1 John 1, 6 through 9. The whole letter is written to people who
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.360]   are using their bad theology, wrong theology, to
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.120]   embrace a life of licentiousness.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.560]   1 John is written to people who have been influenced by the Gnostics.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.400]   The Gnostics basically taught that your flesh is evil
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   and there's nothing to be redeemed by your flesh. So when Christ came and died,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   he saved us in our spirit but our flesh doesn't matter.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.440]   So therefore you can do whatever in your flesh
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.920]   because God saved us in the spirit. And so they apply that to their lives to live
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.400]   in licentiousness and do whatever they want.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.520]   And so they say well one saved always saved. It's by grace so it doesn't matter.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.560]   And so John is writing to a group of people who
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.680]   have embraced this kind of theology and this is what he says. "If we say
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.880]   that we have fellowship with him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.080]   practice the truth." In other words, we deceive ourselves.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.280]   "But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.880]   fellowship with one another. And the blood of Jesus,
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.080]   his son, cleanses us from all sin." So in other words, if you say that you
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   have fellowship with God and you continue to live in darkness
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.000]   and you see the grace of God as just, you know, get out of jail
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.600]   card, right? You know, remember when we were young,
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.200]   you know, you would, you would, you know, cross your fingers
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.680]   and as long as you cross your fingers back here, you can tell all kinds of lies.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.720]   You can do basically whatever you want because this is a get out of free
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.560]   free card, right? You can tell all kinds of lies and at the end they say, "Hey,
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.840]   you're a liar." Say, "Ah." Meaning that you're free from whatever it is
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.760]   that you've done because I did this. For people who are living in sin are
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.720]   living with their fingers crossed. Well, I made a decision. I said, I
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.000]   believe and I crossed the line and I checked off the box
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.880]   and they continue to live in sin. There is no struggling for righteousness.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.040]   It's not, their repentance is, all of it is, okay, I acknowledge that and they
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.680]   go right back into sinning and he says, "If an individual is living in sin,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.920]   he's an unbeliever who's rejecting Christ." These are people again who have
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.800]   convinced themselves that as long as they cross their fingers,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.320]   as long as they've got it, you know, checked off the box
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.640]   and went down the aisle so many years ago and they got baptized that that's
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.240]   their get out of get out of jail free card. So, the rest of it, it doesn't matter.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.440]   He says in verse 26, "If that's who you are, a willful sinner who is continuing
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.120]   to live in sin," he says, "there is no longer sacrifice for
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.800]   their sins," in verse 26. And what he means by that, he's not
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:11.440]   saying that that person can't repent. That if a only way of salvation, only way
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.840]   of receiving forgiveness is through the blood of Christ
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.760]   and you've been taught all of that, you had every advantage
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.920]   versus non-Christians and you choose to walk away from that, what he means by
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.760]   that is there is no other way of atoning for your sins.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.360]   If you've rejected the only way of salvation, the only mediator between us
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.840]   and God is the man Christ Jesus and you've heard
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.960]   all of this and you superficially acknowledge it
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.240]   and yet in your life you're continuing to live in sin, he says, "there is no
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.360]   longer any sacrifice." There's no longer any hope for this individual.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.600]   It is a very dangerous place to be in, to be inside the church and to be fooled
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.640]   all his life and then to meet a God who will judge.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.280]   And this is reason why the scripture is here and why he's speaking to people
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.120]   inside the church because being inside the church
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.720]   doesn't guarantee genuine faith. Being God, doing godly things doesn't
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.840]   guarantee genuine faith unless all Christianity to you
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.560]   is for this life. You have good friends, you live with purpose, have some good
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.800]   morals, raise children in a nice nice culture. If that's all Christianity
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.760]   means to you, then you're here and just out the door
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.080]   and whatever causes you to be uncomfortable you can just ignore it.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.440]   But if we genuinely believe what we profess to believe, there are serious
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.000]   consequences of not examining our life and being
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.320]   certain that if we have genuine faith. Now he's
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.200]   not talking about people who are struggling with sin.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.800]   In fact, he says in that same passage, 1 John 1 verse 9,
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.400]   "if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.000]   and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.920]   See an individual struggling with sin because we still have our flesh, we still
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.560]   wrestle, we still struggle, right? There are times we fall and we
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.160]   repent, we get back up because the grace of God covers over us.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.880]   Our salvation is not dependent upon our righteous deeds but what he has done.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.480]   But there's a struggle for sanctification. There's a struggle and
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.240]   there's a straining, there's pressing on toward the goal.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.200]   So he's not talking about that. He's talking about an individual who is
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.760]   willfully and continually choosing to live in sin
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.320]   while confessing that he's a believer. He said there is no
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.800]   longer sacrifice for sins. He gives a reason why this is so
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.480]   important because in Hebrews chapter 10, 28 to 31, this is how God sees
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.280]   someone who is living in sin. "Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.000]   without mercy on a testimony of two or three witnesses. How much severe
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.800]   punishment do you think he will deserve who has
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   trampled underfoot the Son of God?"
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.400]   Part of the reason why, especially in the western
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.440]   world, the Christian world, where people don't have
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.160]   a clear understanding of God's wrath and holiness is because we avoid it even in
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.000]   our preaching. So a lot of people in the church have
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.560]   this idea that God of the Old Testament didn't tolerate sin. It was no nonsense.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.480]   God gave laws. If you broke it, you died. That's the Old Testament God. But when we
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.240]   come to the New Testament, he's like a, you know, grandfather that
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.400]   always has candy in his pocket. No matter what we do, he's okay with it.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.920]   And so one saved always saved and then he goes. So the God of the Old Testament
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.000]   doesn't fit the God of the New Testament. And so God of the New Testament is a God
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.520]   that we would love to have. That's the God that we want to go to
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.280]   heaven and see and be in his house. Because he
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.000]   always wants to see us, no matter what condition we are in,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.200]   no matter what kind of life we're in. He's like a grandfather
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.680]   who just doesn't care and he just he just loves us no matter what we do.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.440]   And so the God of the Old Testament just doesn't fit our culture.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.120]   So we have a tendency to kind of avoid that and then we kind of
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.480]   hover around the New Testament where there's promises of eternal life,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.840]   promise of forgiveness. And so and then we kind of avoid
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.240]   Revelation because that's kind of hard to understand.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.680]   And then we come to these passages and kind of like gloss over.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.480]   That must be talking to non-Christians. But look what he says, "How much
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.280]   more severe punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under the
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.640]   footstool of God? He has regarded as unclean the blood of
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.920]   the covenant by which he was sanctified and has
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:39.360]   insulted the spirit of grace." See I think part of the reason why you
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.880]   know when we drift and when we're lukewarm that we feel completely
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.160]   safe and we have all the time in the world. It's like wow this is not where I
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.520]   should be but you know that's just the way we are.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.760]   That's just Orange County Christianity and we just
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.640]   we're okay with it. Well God is saying no he's not okay with it.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.120]   He said the way he sees an individual who had all the privileges
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.960]   and willfully chooses to live a life that is contrary to the gospel that he
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.840]   has heard. He said it is like trampling underfoot
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.640]   the son of God. This is not just a casually drifting.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.480]   He says it is trampling, disrespecting, unclean
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.000]   the blood of the covenant. Something that is very sacred
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.760]   he's considering treating it as rubbish.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.240]   And it is an insult to the spirit of grace. The Bible says if there's one sin
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.840]   that cannot be forgiven it is the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.560]   And that's what he is referring to. An individual who professes one thing
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.480]   but by his life he is grieving the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.840]   And he says for we know him who said vengeance is mine.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.080]   I will repay. That God of the Old Testament is the same God of the New
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.640]   Testament. In fact the judgment in the New Testament is
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.320]   much more severe. And the reason why it's much more severe
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.400]   is in the Old Testament God would give promise of judgment but
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.720]   he was all he would always break in and say
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   but I will remember the remnant. My son is coming.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.760]   The Messiah is coming and he's going to forgive sins.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.200]   Yet in the New Testament when the judgment finally comes
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.440]   it is the end. There is no hope after the white throne judgment.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.920]   There is no warning. There is there is no second chance.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.280]   Once the judgment comes from the second covenant
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.920]   he says it is the end. There is no other Messiah that's coming. There's no other
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.800]   crucifixion that's coming. That's why he says there is no other sacrifice.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:36.320]   If after hearing all of this and you choose to walk away.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.560]   Why does he say this? And obviously it is offensive to God.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.200]   But secondly ultimately it is to demonstrate his grace.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.320]   And you say well what are you talking about? Like there's nothing that I said
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.040]   this morning sounds anywhere remotely close to grace.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.720]   You see God is being gracious when he says all of this because
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.280]   his desire for this is for sinners to repent.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.280]   If God was done with us there would be no warning.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.120]   We would be gone. You wouldn't be hearing any preaching.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.840]   There is no warning in scripture. All this drama in the book of Revelation
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:21.520]   is a warning for us to take heed. So it is his grace that causes us
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.520]   to listen to this and be warned and to take seriously.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.240]   Not only for Christians to understand the urgency of this message
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:37.200]   but for us to share it with urgency. God uses warning to wake up the church
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.560]   so that we would be gracious as he is gracious.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.720]   So if you really see that from this perspective one of the most gracious
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:50.320]   things that he can do to a straying unbeliever is to warn him
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.840]   about the judgment that is waiting for him if he continues to drift down this
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.040]   path. Second Peter 3.9 he says the Lord is not
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.760]   slow about his promise as some count slowness
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.960]   but is patient toward you not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.160]   repentance. He said the reason why he didn't come
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.600]   2,000 years ago is because God is being patient with
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.800]   mankind. The reason why this text is in this
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.240]   passage, the reason why Revelation is in the New Testament is because God
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:27.200]   doesn't want sinners to perish. He wants them to come to Christ.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.920]   The real judgment is going to come and when it comes
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.560]   there is no second chance. You will not be able to cry out to God and say God
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.560]   I'm sorry that I didn't pay attention. You're not going to be able to stand
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.120]   under the judgment seat on the white throne and say
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.960]   if you would just give me one more year or one more day.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.360]   You see white throne judgment when it comes it is the end it is finished.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.000]   So therefore he says if you are drifting and you are willfully living against the
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.560]   will of God understand the real judgment is coming.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.840]   This warning is a revelation of God's grace,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.560]   his mercy.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.640]   Now how are we to apply this?
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.560]   It is if we're not careful we can hear sermons like this or we can
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.440]   look at passages like this and our first response is I don't want
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.400]   this I don't know another fire and brimstone sermon.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.000]   Even if it is based on scripture I don't want to hear it.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.200]   There's things that I want to know things that I don't want to know and
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.480]   this is one of those things that I don't think fits my life.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.320]   So you can say Christ is Lord all you want
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.520]   with words it means nothing right. I can say I'm six feet tall
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.760]   no one's going to be convinced right because that's not the reality.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.040]   You can say that you're a believer in Christ and Christ is your Lord but if
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.880]   you don't submit to every part of scripture
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.840]   those are just empty words. But if we're not careful
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.000]   one of the wrong ways to respond to this is simply reject it because it doesn't
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.520]   fit my reality it doesn't fit the kind of Christian life that I want. That's
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.880]   that's one of the wrong ways. But another wrong way to accept this is
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.560]   to say yes we need more of this. In fact I why don't you preach this
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.600]   every week. In fact that's going to be the central
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.480]   message that I'm going to be preaching to everybody that I hear
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:27.920]   that I know right. Judgment, harshness, you know warning and if we're not
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.200]   careful we can be more concerned about judgment
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.800]   than they are concerned about bringing them to salvation. The reason why he puts
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.160]   this in here is is not simply to say hey you're going to be judged and then
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.440]   just walk away. It is a gracious God warning sinners to return.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:52.400]   It is for the purpose of restoration. You see the danger of misapplying the
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.160]   judgment of God is that we can take people who are in dire
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.440]   need of encouragement. It could be an individual who's been
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.080]   trying so hard and is constantly falling short like
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.920]   as an example if you have a child who's you know waking up early and trying to
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.040]   trying to take the test and memorizing did everything that he or she could
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.240]   possibly do but they just couldn't get the grade.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.120]   And they got a C and he said well you didn't get an A?
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:24.720]   How dare you get out of my house. See we if we're not careful we can
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.000]   misapply this to people who are in dire need of encouragement
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.920]   and they they need to be reminded that we're not it's not by works it's by the
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.520]   grace of God and that's why we're able to persevere.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.200]   So we can apply it in the wrong manner just bringing condemnation
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.400]   to the wrong people but then the other end of application that we can get wrong
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.280]   is say well if they say they're Christian let's be gracious and just
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.480]   accept what they say and the consequence of that is we're
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   we're giving assurance to people so that we don't rock the boat so that
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.520]   they they're not angry with us while all the while
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.720]   that they may meet a holy God who's going to judge them for eternity
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:14.000]   and giving people assurance that everything is okay
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.720]   while they are day every day drawing closer to eternal
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.040]   condemnation. So the consequence of both is severe so we need to be
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.720]   careful that the way that we apply this that we
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.440]   apply it accurately first and foremost we need to make sure that whenever we
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.800]   apply certain things like this that we're
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.560]   not at either extreme right we don't simply reject it because it
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.320]   doesn't fit fit what we want nor do we just think like okay now
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.720]   everybody needs to be condemned nobody is a Christian
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.080]   and so therefore you know the condemnation is upon everybody except
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.880]   for maybe one or two people. Principles of how we ought to be
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.240]   applying this one don't use your moral compass as a guide
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.360]   to determine what is right and wrong right how it sits well sits with you
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.800]   or doesn't sit well with you should not be the standard of what you
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.520]   accept and don't accept. If it doesn't fit well with you why why
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.480]   doesn't it fit well with you is it because of something that you know of
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.160]   scripture is it contradicting certain doctrines
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.120]   of the bible or just simply just the worldview or the
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.720]   God that you desire isn't this God. Be careful not to use your own
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.680]   moral compass as a guide to determine what is right and wrong look at this
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.520]   world look at this world they can't even
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.800]   determine who's a male and who's a female
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.560]   you know we have the world pounding for justice but what justice what is just
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:45.200]   what is just for one person is unjust for another person
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.560]   we have to make sure that we do not conform to this world but be transformed
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.200]   by the renewing of our mind that the word of God
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.480]   is going to dictate what is right and wrong and if I if
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.240]   something that I sense that I hear the word of God and it doesn't
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.120]   sit well with me the problem is with me not the word of God
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.040]   so do not use our moral compass as a guide to determine what is right and
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.640]   wrong secondly whenever these things are taught and
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.000]   we we learn do not turn this around immediately to
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.400]   other people say yes you know like my my brother
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.760]   needs to hear this so I have a friend my co-worker that church
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.880]   that pastor they need to hear this they need to preach this
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.440]   first and foremost we we need to take every part of the word of God and
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.560]   examine ourselves the word of God is given to us to judge
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.160]   the thoughts and intentions of our own heart just like the second
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.240]   corinthians 13 5 test yourselves to see if you are of the faith examine
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:50.400]   yourselves so first and foremost when we hear these things is our life
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:56.400]   is there evidence of self-righteousness versus righteousness
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.600]   if we're not careful we can take the word of God and easily
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.280]   feed our self-righteousness it becomes not a lamp as a guide for our feet it
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:10.560]   becomes a flashlight to point out other people's darkness so first don't
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.320]   use your own moral compass as what is right and wrong secondly make sure
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.160]   that we examine ourselves first what is our motive
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.680]   if we're going to teach this if we're going to share this is our motive just
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.560]   to tell them they're wrong or is it to bring them to Christ
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.360]   how we preach about the judgment of God to the people that we love and care
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.160]   about versus these people that we don't care
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.520]   about is night and day our tone you may be saying the same thing
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.240]   but our tone and our motive is to bring them condemnation versus
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.000]   wanting to see them come to Christ to know
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.320]   that all that the scripture says about the condemnation it is a holy God being
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.760]   gracious to sinners warning them to return check our motives
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.160]   and make sure that we watch our lives and our doctrines carefully
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.760]   that we take it seriously that that when we see these things
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:11.760]   that we have a sense of urgency there should be a heaviness when we think
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.000]   about the judgment of God you know I think again the part of the
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   reason why there isn't a sense of seriousness in
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   the church in our generation is because of the lack of understanding
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.560]   of the judgment of God it's not because we are not passionate
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.680]   people think about what's going on outside the
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:37.120]   world today we have people who are so impassioned because there is a
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.640]   perception that there is injustice to a group of
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.760]   people around the world and you know exactly
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.600]   what I'm talking about they are willing to march they are
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.360]   willing to go to jail they are willing to commit violence
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   because they feel that this needs to happen
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.400]   because they have compassion because they feel sorry for people
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.800]   because they're not getting the job that they need because it's they're
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.520]   being treated unfairly now I can understand that from the secular world
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.560]   because this is all they have but I do not understand this from the
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.880]   Christian world where we are so lackadaisical about
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.840]   people who are suffering and dying going to hell
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.600]   and we proclaim this gospel we sing about this gospel
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.560]   and yet when was the last time the church cried out
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.520]   for people who are going to hell people are willing to march
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.640]   and give up their comfort so that they can have an
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:45.920]   equal footing to get jobs to buy houses when was the last time the
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.600]   church got on their knees crying out for people who will be in
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:55.040]   hell for eternity if they do not turn from their sins
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:01.440]   how can a church be so lackadaisical about the judgment that is coming upon
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.640]   mankind and be so impassioned about a temporary
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.360]   injustice no one is saying don't get me wrong
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.680]   I'm not saying that it's not Christian's responsibility to speak up for injustice
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.880]   to fight for those who don't have voices but when our priorities are mixed up
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.920]   when we don't understand the heaviness what the gospel preaches
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.120]   where we put all our eggs in this basket and yet
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   we don't think twice about the songs that we sing
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.080]   about the gospel that we proclaim to know and to love
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.480]   knowing that we have a generation of souls who've never heard the gospel
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.080]   we are surrounded by people who don't understand the gospel
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.160]   we have a churches filled with people who have been attending all their lives
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:58.240]   cannot articulate how they get saved yet we don't grieve for that we don't
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.560]   march for that we don't cry out for that we preach on it
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:08.720]   we memorize scripture but we're not anywhere near that passion as what we
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.280]   are seeing outside I understand the world but the
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.160]   priorities have been misplaced
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:23.360]   we need to make sure that we have our priorities straight that there is a
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.680]   sense of urgency and that's why this is here not only to
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.000]   warn the non-christians who are in the church who are deceived
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.360]   but also to wake up christians so that we recognize the seriousness
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.800]   of what it is that you and I profess to believe
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.920]   the gospel is not simply a security blanket
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.520]   so that we can continue to live our lives the way we desire it is the power
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.920]   of God unto salvation to everyone who believes
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:55.200]   and it is the only power of God to salvation to everyone who believes
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:01.120]   thirdly do not judge from a distance whenever we we apply this we can easily
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.000]   look at people as well they're not doing this they're not doing this and
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.920]   a good christian should be doing this and not be doing that
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.480]   you can't ever know what's going on with individuals from a distance
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:18.720]   people have struggles and that person may need our encouragement and we apply
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.520]   condemnation and we've we've done disservice we've
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.400]   crushed somebody who needs grace and then you have people who are outright
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.240]   living in sin and rebelling against God and have no
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.360]   evidence of the holy spirit in him and we constantly tell them say hey don't
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.880]   ever question don't ever question don't ever examine
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.800]   and we're giving them assurance as they are drifting to hell
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.880]   we cannot judge from a distance we need to be careful we need to examine
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.440]   and then fourth and finally always give the full counsel of God and not just
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.840]   what seems palatable always give the full counsel of God the
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.080]   bible says that we cannot bear fruit unless we abide in Christ you cannot
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.640]   abide in Christ if you hold on to certain things and
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.080]   reject other things either you embrace the whole counsel of
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   God or you embrace you reject all of it you cannot pick and
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:16.400]   choose what you want we must teach the full counsel of God
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:22.320]   God is giving this warning because he is generous in his grace
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.920]   he's not simply slapping us he's just he's causing the church
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.400]   to repent and come to him again as I said there is no warning after the
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:36.880]   white throne judgment it is the end do not neglect to warn
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.160]   because if sinners do not come to Christ because of his tremendous grace
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.480]   they need to at least come to Christ because of fear and trembling
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.920]   however they come to Christ they must come to Christ
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.680]   because there's only one way of salvation
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.480]   so this text is here not simply put a damper on our day
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.840]   not simply so that we can go off and feel guilty it's like oh my gosh what
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:07.520]   am I doing with my life but understand this as God's grace
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:12.160]   it is his grace that causes sinners to wake up it is his grace to bring
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.840]   revival into the church so that we can be what God has called
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.920]   us to be to be a light in this dark world it is
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.840]   not enough that you and I just make it to the end
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.400]   it is not enough for you to for you and I to just live our life comfortably
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.000]   and then get to the end part of our life and say whew I made it now I get to go to
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.760]   heaven there's a reason why God left us here
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.040]   why the day that we were justified that we didn't die and go to heaven for
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.880]   eternity why cause us to suffer here why cause us
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.720]   to be here you know I I've been I've been saved over
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.400]   35 years the 35 years I could have been in heaven why
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:55.120]   did he leave me here why did he leave you here because he
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.880]   doesn't want us to come by ourselves
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:04.400]   he doesn't want us to come by ourselves because there are people in your lives
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.320]   that you are the best person to share the gospel with them
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.840]   you are the best person and you are the nearest person
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.760]   to warn them about the judgment that is coming
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.680]   to tell them about the hope that we have in Christ
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:25.040]   that's why we are here so if our lives in anything that we are doing does not
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.920]   align with that commission that God has given
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:34.480]   the church this text is here to get us recalibrated
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:40.560]   does our life fit in is it consistent with the gospel that we
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.280]   profess so again my prayer is is the same thing
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.040]   every single week that as we hear this and apply this that
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:54.720]   we would live up to the gospel that we profess let's pray
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:42:03.440]   heavenly father we thank you for your constant grace and love
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.680]   you know lord god that we are weak sinners who are absolutely dependent on
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.520]   your grace just to make it from day to day
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.320]   lord help us lord god to see the reality of the spiritual battle that's going on
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   that we would not chase after things that the world is chasing after
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:27.040]   knowing father god that at the end that there is judgment i pray that within
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.520]   our church that if anyone who's willfully sinning
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.720]   and has rejected you by their life bring them to repentance
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.160]   cause them to see lord god if there's any bit
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:45.360]   or even a tiny bit of faith in them bring them to repentance
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.080]   i pray father god for for us who are striving
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.840]   and day to day even struggling help us lord god to cling on to the grace
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:00.400]   that we would not drift away from christ that we would not go from day to day
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:05.360]   just nonchalantly being fully satisfied that we're okay
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.560]   help us to recognize the temporary world that we're in that is under condemnation
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:15.120]   that we would be sober bring revival lord god to our church
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.880]   that we would be a church that is a light in this dark world
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.400]   so i pray father god that you would help us and guide us and renew us
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.840]   by your word in jesus name we pray amen
