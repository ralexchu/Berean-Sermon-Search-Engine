[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Now, it's going to be the awards ceremony.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Can we have in third place, Scrantonia!
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Come on to the stage!
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Right where the ticket box is.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And in second place, can we have Wakanda!
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And in first place, North Korea!
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   [cheering]
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Now, please give a big round of applause for your three champions!
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Yay!
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Now, after this, the previous teams are going to go to a ceremony.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   The ceremony is going to be a banquet for all the winners who accepted the prize and want to join in the party.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   But the Marines realize that they can't choose both Justin and God, after all, no one can serve two masters.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Hey guys, let's celebrate our victory!
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Let's have a banquet together!
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   But not everyone accepted our invitation, how about we ask them?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Hey guys, why don't you come out of your pity corner and celebrate with us?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   [cheering]
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Why would you invite me? I cheated fair and square, but I'm so undeserving for this. Why are you being so nice?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah, why are you being so nice?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   God invites everyone to the table, as long as you repent of your sins.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Wow.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Question, who's more merciful than God?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Uh, me?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   False, no one is more merciful than God. God even beats Battlestar Galactica.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And anyways, we can't serve two masters. Join us and we can teach you more about the Bible and Jesus.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You know what? You guys are right. I'm going to choose God over Justin because God always wins.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Let's pray guys. Dear God, please forgive me for all the sins I have done. Amen.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   God is so strong.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   God is strong!
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yeah, why don't you guys join us in our celebration?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Okay.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Oh.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I seem to be a little lost. Do any of you know where Breann is?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   [music]
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   [laughing]
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It is I, Nemesis of Genesis.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Wait, right, I became good.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Because you guys know that I am following God now, right?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I am no longer in the dark side.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Because you guys know that what? We cannot serve?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You guys are so smart.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Anyway, I came here looking for my twin brother. Have you guys seen him?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Maybe. There is this guy named Andrew Chong. He is a little lost. Maybe you can help him.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Hey!
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Stop copying me!
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Jesus! What did you make food?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Pizza!
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You are my brother!
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Wow, congrats Nemesis on finding your brother. Why don't you join us in our celebration?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   We are celebrating the joy we have of being on God's side because He always wins.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Sweet! Thank you so much!
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Yeah, let's go!
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   [cheering]
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   [music]
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   [music]
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   [music]
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   [music]
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Alright, let's give them one more big round of applause for our good team.
