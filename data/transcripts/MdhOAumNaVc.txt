[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:14.300]   - Good evening, everybody.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.300]   I'm glad we can come together to remember the salvation
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.300]   that Christ has accomplished.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.300]   And as we reflect upon that during the whole week,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.300]   this evening, after our worship time,
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   we're gonna have our brother Adam Wong come up
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300]   and share his salvation testimony.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   And then we'll continue reflecting on today,
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.300]   Silent Wednesday, as we think about the events
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.300]   that took place leading up to Christ going to the cross.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.300]   Let's take a moment to pray as we enter into time of worship.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.300]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, God, for your grace.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.300]   Lord, I pray that as we are coming each night
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.300]   to reflect and think,
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.300]   may all the various steps that you took continue, Lord,
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.300]   to help us appreciate the magnificent work
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.300]   that you have accomplished.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.300]   Help us, Father God, to reflect on every angle of the gospel.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.300]   Help us to see, Father Lord, the weight of sin
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.300]   that we, as human race, have exhibited, Lord, in our lives.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   And I pray, Father God, that all the more we would be seeking you,
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.300]   all the more we'd be thankful to you, Lord, for your great work.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.300]   We pray, Father God, that as a lot of us are coming in
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.300]   just from our workplaces, perhaps a little bit fatigued,
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.300]   Lord, would you grant to us great spiritual energy
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   to be able to just lift up to you our song,
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.300]   also to be able to hear the words and be refreshed.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.300]   And God, that ultimately, Lord, all things would turn to you
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.300]   in great adoration and worship.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.300]   We lift this time up to you, Lord, that's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.300]   Amen.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.300]   Let's all rise.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:03.300]   Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.300]   Stronger than darkness, new and evermore
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:23.300]   Stronger than darkness, new and evermore
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.300]   Lord, when thou could remember the wrongs we have done
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   Unleash it on all we who pass not their sin
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.300]   Thrown into a sea where the bottom was shore
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:48.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:59.300]   Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:06.300]   Stronger than darkness, new and evermore
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:27.300]   When patience would wait as we constantly wait
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.300]   What Father so tender is calling us home
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:38.300]   He welcomes the weak, He's the valest, the poor
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:56.300]   Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:03.300]   Stronger than darkness, new and evermore
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:09.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:32.300]   [Guitar]
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:38.300]   What riches of kindness we've managed to miss
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.300]   His blood was a payment, His life was a cost
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:51.300]   We stand at the dead, we could never afford
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:12.300]   Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   Stronger than darkness, new and evermore
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:23.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:35.300]   Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.300]   Stronger than darkness, new and evermore
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:46.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:59.300]   Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.300]   Amen
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   [Guitar]
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.300]   What is our hope in life and death?
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.300]   Christ alone, Christ alone
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   What is our only confidence?
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.300]   That our souls to Him belong
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.300]   Who holds our days when in His hand
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   Who comes apart from His command
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.300]   And what will keep us to the end?
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:12.300]   The love of Christ in which we stand
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   Oh, sing hallelujah
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   Our hope spends eternal, oh, sing hallelujah
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.300]   Now and ever we confess
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   Christ our hope in life and death
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:45.300]   [Guitar]
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.300]   Truth can calm the troubled soul
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:55.300]   God is good, God is good
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:01.300]   There is His grace and goodness known
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.300]   In our grave, Redeemer's blood
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.300]   Who holds our faith when fears arise
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.300]   Who stands above the stormy trial
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.300]   Who sends a wave that brings us safe
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:29.300]   Unto the shore of the rock of trial
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:35.300]   Oh, sing hallelujah
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   Our hope spends eternal, oh, sing hallelujah
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.300]   Now and ever we confess
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.300]   Christ our hope in life and death
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   [Guitar]
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.300]   Into the grave what will we sing?
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.300]   Christ He lives, Christ He lives
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:17.300]   And what reward will heaven bring?
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.300]   Everlasting life with Him
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   That we will rise to meet the Lord
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.300]   Sin and death will be destroyed
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.300]   And we will feast in endless joy
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   Christ is ours forevermore
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   Oh, sing hallelujah
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:15:01.300]   Our hope spends eternal, oh, sing hallelujah
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   Now and ever we confess
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   Christ our hope in life and death
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:15.300]   Oh, sing hallelujah
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:25.300]   Our hope spends eternal, oh, sing hallelujah
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.300]   Now and ever we confess
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.300]   Christ our hope in life and death
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   Now and ever we confess
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   Christ our hope in life and death
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.300]   [Guitar]
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:16:09.300]   Hello church family.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.300]   Alright.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   My name is Adam Wong and I'm thankful and excited to share my testimony
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   because I believe it might resonate with a lot of you and it testifies to God's grace.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.300]   It's kind of funny, I feel like the last two sharings with Pastor Peter Chung and Pastor Nate
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.300]   have basically been just a summary of my own testimony.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   In short, the Lord saved me through showing me my self-righteousness
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.300]   and by leading me to faith in Christ alone for salvation
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.300]   through the preaching of his word and the reading of his word.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.300]   My whole life I lived in the Christian community.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.300]   I was born into the same church that my parents grew up in
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.300]   where they met, where they served, where they were married in.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   All my life I've known about God.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.300]   I've read the Bible. I sang the songs.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.300]   I used to say that I first believed it when I was five.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.300]   But when I look back on that confession, I don't believe it was true.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:12.300]   There was more of a desire to please my parents than to truly repent and believe in Christ.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   But most of my life I thought I was a believer.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.300]   I looked the part and I played the part.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   I jumped into serving the church and into leadership roles.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   Why? The same reason why I first professed Christ.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.300]   Out of a fear of man and wanting to please those around me.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   The kingdom I was building was my own pleasure, my own reputation before others.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.300]   Jesus was simply a means to that end.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.300]   Most of my life at church was marked by being the good church boy.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.300]   Of course I wasn't perfect.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   I would admit that I wasn't perfect so that I wouldn't sound prideful.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   But overall I didn't see my sins as the main issue.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   And it showed how I lived totally different at school.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.300]   I was a bully, a punk, a classically rebellious kid.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:05.300]   Whatever I could do to be seen as someone reputable or cool or approved by people, I pursued it.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.300]   At school the context was different from church, but the problem was the same.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.300]   The kingdom I was building was my own.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.300]   I lived these two different lives seeking the approval of man wherever I could
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.300]   with a small view of my sin and a small view of God.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:29.300]   But by the grace of God, he began to shake me from this place of self-centered double living.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.300]   It was in my sophomore year of high school that I began to slowly understand
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.300]   that the gospel was more than just a Sunday thing.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.300]   The gospel was more than just a church thing, a tradition from our family,
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   more than just a good lesson.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   It wasn't through some kind of life-changing experience or one particular retreat
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.300]   or one particular pastor's sermon that I came to understand the truth.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   God graciously broke down my pride through the weekly preaching of his word
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.300]   and through my personal reading of his word.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   Slowly yet surely, I began to believe.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:16.300]   I began to see my deep sinfulness, my hopelessness before God's holy judgment.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   I began to see the wickedness in trying to use God for my glory when it's all about him.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.300]   I saw that left to myself, I turned to sin again and again and again.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.300]   How quickly I could turn something like vacuuming the church into a way to glorify myself.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.300]   How prideful in that.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.300]   While I have maybe even went to church and read my Bible with a legalistic heart,
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   by the grace of God, he used that so that I would see my sin.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.300]   Not only that I would see it, but that I would see Jesus.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:57.300]   That the good news of his blood covers all of that sinfulness that I was starting to feel and see and realize.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.300]   Faith in his work and his resurrection brings life to my soul.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.300]   He is the only way of life, not by my works, not by how much I served,
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.300]   not by how long I spent at church, how many dishes I cleaned,
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.300]   how much I knew or how much I was accepted by people.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.300]   And the solution was not to dig in deeper once I saw my sin,
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.300]   to memorize more, to read more, etc., etc.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   I needed to look to Christ.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:30.300]   And coming to this truth I realized, if I'm going to look to Christ, I can't live this double life at school.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:37.300]   If I was one with Christ and if I was called to follow him, then I must be one person.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.300]   Though I've had seasons of doubt looking back even on sophomore year, my confession of faith,
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   I've come to believe it was genuine, that there was faith there, even as small as a mustard seed.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.300]   And I'm thankful to God for his love to me.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.300]   Just as we've heard the last two days, God hates self-exalting religion.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:04.300]   He hated how the religious elite used worship of him as a way to profit themselves.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   In God's anger and in his mercy and in his love, he exposes that sin to them.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.300]   And while they harden their hearts and remain deluded in self-glory,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:25.300]   I can say that it's by the grace of God that he allowed me to see my sin and to see my need.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   Someone who didn't feel like he needed to see that, he showed me.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:37.300]   Not the hours of sermons I listened to or the number of books that I've read that opened my eyes.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   Church family, it was simply his grace.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:47.300]   So while I still struggle with the fear of man at times, I'm thankful for his inviting and loving grace.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   How often have I overtly or subtly tried to use him for my glory.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   And in his judgment, I deserve to be left alone to my sin.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:05.300]   But Jesus was gracious and is still gracious to show me again and again the sickness of my sin,
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.300]   the perversion of my self-glorifying church boy ways.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:16.300]   But all this that I might fall at his feet in desperate need and love.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.300]   A verse that's constantly been coming to my mind is Luke 747.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:26.300]   For this reason I say to you, her sins which are many have been forgiven, for she loved much.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.300]   But he who is forgiven little, loves little.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:33.300]   Before I didn't realize how much I needed to be forgiven.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.300]   But now I see, I've been forgiven much.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   In the coldness and the hardness of my heart, the Lord opened my eyes to see sin.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.300]   And has shown me forgiveness in Christ.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:52.300]   By his grace I believe and I want to love him much.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.300]   Thank you.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:00.300]   [Applause]
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:07.300]   Okay.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   As we continue to reflect upon this week and just again,
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   the various aspects of what Christ has accomplished,
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   we're so thankful for everything that Christ has done.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.300]   Thank you Adam for sharing how the Lord has been good to you with us.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   At this time let's take a moment to turn in our Bibles to Matthew 26, verses 14-19.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:39.300]   Matthew 26, verses 14-19.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   Today is called Silent Wednesday.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:54.300]   And here we see a narrative of what Judas did during this day.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.300]   Let's take a moment to read this passage.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   Matthew 16, verses 14-19.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:05.300]   And it says, "Then one of the twelve named Judas Iscariot went to the chief priest and said,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   'What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?'
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.300]   And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.300]   From then on he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.300]   Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked,
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   'Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?'
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   And he said, 'Go into the city to a certain man and say to him,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:33.300]   'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I am to keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.300]   The disciples did as Jesus had directed them and they prepared the Passover."
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   Real briefly, I want to review the various events of the past few weeks
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   using the graphic that our media team shared.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.300]   That on Saturday of the week they came to Bethany and they stayed over at Mary, Martha, and Lazarus' house.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   And the thing about it is, by this time, anywhere Jesus went there was already a crowd.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   There was already a massive crowd and because Lazarus had been raised from the dead,
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.300]   there is just this massive amount of people that are trying to always see Jesus.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.300]   That always upset the Pharisees and the religious leaders of the day.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   On Sunday, Jesus enters into Jerusalem and saying there are masses of people is an understatement.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   I mean, there were hordes of people praising him with palm branches, saying,
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.300]   "Hosanna, Hosanna," which essentially means, "Save us, save us, O son of David."
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   And so, that also upset the religious leaders of the time to the degree
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   they were commanding Jesus, "Make them stop."
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.300]   And then on Monday, Jesus went into the temple and cleared it,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   disrupting the corrupt economy of the temple, you know, essentially marketplace.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   That, sure, upset the religious leaders of the time.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   Just like we reviewed yesterday, Jesus went head-to-head in heated debates,
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.300]   saying parables and describing specific depictions,
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:06.300]   and the Pharisees and the religious leaders knew that Jesus was talking about them.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   And so, that upset the religious leaders even more.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:18.300]   Essentially, what we see as things are developing is there is a ramping up of the hatred of Christ.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   And Pastor Nate eloquently said yesterday night that there was murderous intent by this time.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:30.300]   Already, they wanted him to either be quiet, be disproved, or, you know,
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   or completely thrown off, or seen as a fake, but by this time, they just wanted to eliminate him, right?
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:46.300]   And what you have, essentially, Judas, I think that Judas was one that was paying attention to all that was going on.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:51.300]   You see, perhaps some of the other disciples, maybe Peter might have been thinking,
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.300]   "Ah, Jesus, you stick to him," right?
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.300]   Because there are a lot of Jews who wanted Jesus to be a revolutionary.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.300]   And perhaps there was a lot of people who were already in the community
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   who had angst towards the already established system.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   Clearly, they had angst towards the ruling power, right?
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.300]   Maybe the sons of thunder, right? They were like, "Yeah, bring it down!"
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.300]   Every time he went head-to-head in a debate, maybe they were just sitting there pumping their fists,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   and going, "Ooh, that's right, burn!" You know?
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.300]   And they were just egging him on.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   I think perhaps Judas was sitting there like, "This crazy guy.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:29.300]   He told us he was going to die, but look at him, flipping tables, challenging the authorities.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:35.300]   These high priests, these scribes, these Pharisees and Sadducees, they had temple officers.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.300]   They had security guards. They had soldiers of their own.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:46.300]   A lot of times, they enacted capital punishment when they felt that certain crimes fit the bill."
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.300]   Judas is sitting here like, "This guy is nuts. He's probably going to die."
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:57.300]   Why? Because sometimes, mistakenly, people say the disciples didn't really get it.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.300]   They didn't really know that Jesus was going to go to the cross.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.300]   No, actually, starting from Matthew 16, and even prior to then,
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   Jesus was already both hinting and then explicitly told them, "I am going to suffer."
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   For example, Matthew 16, 21 through 22 says, "From that time,
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.300]   Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem,
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   suffer many things from the elders and chief priests, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.300]   That's when Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, 'God forbid it.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.300]   Lord, this shall never happen to you.'"
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   The disciples knew, they just didn't like the idea.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.300]   Another example, Matthew 17, 22, 23, "And while they were gathering together in Galilee,
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:45.300]   Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:51.300]   He will be raised on the third day.' And they were deeply grieved."
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:58.300]   So, fact. Not only in these instances, but you can count about five instances where Jesus was explicitly clear.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.300]   Prior to that, Jesus also hinted, "The Son of Man must be lifted. The Son of Man must suffer."
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   There were enough pre-disclosures, so to speak, that the disciples should have known if they were paying attention.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:17.300]   But the fact of the matter is, they were just wondering, "Huh? Is that a good idea?"
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.300]   They just didn't like it.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:26.300]   Judas essentially then understood Jesus' statements. He understood, you know, point 1A.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   He just did not also understand point 1B.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:39.300]   In his eyes, he was thinking, "Oh my goodness, this rabbi of ours, this lord and master of ours, is going to get us killed."
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.300]   It's probably what he was thinking.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.300]   Jesus is going to get himself killed and us along with him.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:52.300]   I believe Judas was a calculating man. He was the individual who was taking care of the money bag for the group.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   He was the man, do you remember, when the lady came, broke the alabaster, and was anointing Jesus?
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:05.300]   He was the first one who said, "What a waste! You know, that could have been sold? For the poor, of course."
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   He was a quick calculating man who understood Jesus was going to get himself killed.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.300]   And so, as an opportunist, he decides to get in on the game.
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:21.300]   "If Jesus is going to be killed by the Pharisees, then at least I'm going to benefit from it."
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:29.300]   What I found very interesting was that I just always assumed that the scribes and Pharisees were looking for an opportunity to kill Jesus,
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.300]   so they kind of egged on one of the disciples.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:38.300]   Maybe one of the Pharisees came along and said, "Come here. Let me give you some money."
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.300]   Or something like that. Some deal went down.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:48.300]   After reviewing the details of this passage, notice how in this passage in Matthew 26, verse 14,
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:56.300]   it says that Judas actually went and asked this question of them, "What are you willing to give me?"
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   And Judas, at this point, didn't even have a plan yet.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:05.300]   But what he was doing was he was working with both the Pharisees and the temple officers,
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   those soldiers I was talking about, to devise a plan from that time.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:16.300]   And I thought this was really interesting, because at that moment, then, Judas didn't even have everything planned out.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   As a matter of fact, he, in my eyes, didn't even add that much to the plan.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:28.300]   Do you ever think about that? What did Judas add to the plan of betraying Christ?
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   I mean, you could readily see where Jesus was. There was a crowd following him.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   And then I realized this is the only thing, essentially, Judas was adding to the betrayal and the scheme.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:46.300]   The Pharisees, because of their fear of man, wanted to find Jesus in a secluded moment.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   They wanted to avoid the crowds.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.300]   And so, here in this passage, if you take a look in Luke 22, verse 3 through 6,
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:59.300]   it says, "Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the Twelve,
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.300]   and he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.300]   They were glad and agreed with him money.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:14.300]   So he consented and began seeking a good opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd."
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.300]   Do you see that?
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:23.300]   I'm highlighting these aspects of the story because we're taking a look at Judas and his perspective.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   And to me, what's really interesting about all this is there was such a greed in Judas' heart
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   that I believe Satan seized that, entered into him, and played on him.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:42.300]   Now, just as a quick side note, the story is quite crazy because we recognize that everything that is happening
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.300]   is absolutely according to the timetable of God.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   God is so sovereign that everything is falling into place and the Scripture is being fulfilled.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:59.300]   Nevertheless, Satan is also entering into Judas, fulfilling his schemes and his devices.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   But also, Judas himself is a foolish, greedy man, seizing the opportunity.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.300]   You see everything in play.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:16.300]   And what Judas is doing is he is trying to, I think, make up perhaps for some lost time.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.300]   If Jesus is going to go out, at least I'm going to recoup a little bit of money.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   What's really crazy about this is the passage in Matthew says that they offered, when he asked,
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   "How much will you give me?" they offered 30 pieces of silver.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   When I reviewed that, I was like, "Wait a minute. It's not even gold."
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.300]   This guy is nuts.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   30 pieces of silver in that time would be worth about five weeks' wage, they say.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.300]   It's a month wage.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:51.300]   A lord, a rabbi, a master, even to this individual, walking with him for three years,
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:58.300]   and yet for a single month's wage, he'd be willing to say, "Deal. I consent."
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.300]   This is a greedy individual.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   And what I like to say is this. When an individual gives into one's greed, it makes the individual absolutely foolish.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   The plan is so foolish, Jesus himself calls it foolish.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   The plan is so foolish, when you read it, you kind of wonder,
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.300]   truly, Judas didn't even add much to the entire scheme of things.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   As a matter of fact, in this passage I want to highlight for you, in Matthew 26, verse 55 through 56,
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.300]   it says, "At that time, Jesus said to the crowds who had gathered,"
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.300]   so this, right now, what I'm reading, is when the people actually try to come and seize Jesus,
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:37.300]   he asked this question, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me, as you would against a robber?
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:42.300]   Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   But all this has taken place to fulfill the scriptures of the prophets.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   Then all the disciples left him and fled."
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.300]   Jesus is essentially saying, "This is dumb.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   I was with you every single day.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.300]   You had to scheme, trying to catch me."
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:04.300]   And then the funny thing about it is they're trying to avoid a crowd, but there was already a crowd.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.300]   Jesus was speaking to the crowd there.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   But essentially, when I think about this, I think about, as a reflection and meditation,
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.300]   there is such a greed in Judas' heart that we can reflect on.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   We ask the question, "If we are tempted with this, I guess, expectation of what is Jesus going to avail to me,
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:38.300]   what kind of benefit, or perhaps if Satan would tempt us with this kind of complaint, this is a waste of time.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:48.300]   Or perhaps the angst and frustration that perhaps we live in this day, where Satan puts these foolish words into our head,
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:52.300]   where we start to complain and say, "I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   I'm tired of going town to town.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.300]   I'm tired of asking.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   I'm tired of going through the village and having to pick up the leftover grain."
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   Those kinds of sentiments, what does that reveal?
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:13.300]   I think those kind of sentiments are the sentiments essentially pervasive in this generation.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.300]   And so I want to give you this question.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:22.300]   When Judas is tempted with this betrayal, this disloyalty,
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:33.300]   I wonder if his reason and rationale for him following Jesus in the first place is actually the exact same reason why he is betraying him now.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   If Judas thought like the rest of the disciples, "Hey, Jesus, look at you.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.300]   Look at the crowds on our side.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.300]   Look at all the people.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.300]   You've got number on your side.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:47.300]   So now tell us who's going to be on your right and left."
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.300]   I'm pretty sure Judas was also listening.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:56.300]   "Yes, Jesus, tell us who is going to be on your right and left."
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:03.300]   And so what's really interesting about this is with Judas' greed and his looking to Christ for some kind of benefit,
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:10.300]   even if at least you're going to gain me this 30 shekels, 30 silver.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   That is a horrible, horrible sentiment.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.300]   But what I liken it to is somebody who has Jesus in their garage.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.300]   What do I mean?
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   I believe one of the grave sins of this generation is a lot of time people like holding on to Christ as something of value,
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   valuable enough that I can't throw him away.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.300]   They'll like to have him in his garage just in case we need him.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.300]   But when the opportune time comes, we might have a garage sale.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.300]   Because at least if I sell it, then I'll have some money.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:50.300]   What's really crazy about all this, again, is we can reflect on lots of different things.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:57.300]   Oh my gosh, incredible amounts of vanity that Judas would walk with Jesus for so long and be able to betray him in that moment.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:04.300]   But in the end, when greed takes control of the heart, we would do all kinds of heinous things.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.300]   And so as a reflection and challenge to us, I want to ask you,
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:15.300]   do you have any of these discontent, disappointed sentiments, perhaps even a grumbling complaint against Christ?
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   Lord, what have you done for me though?
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.300]   Why aren't you helping me though?
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   If that is the case, we have to be very careful, amen?
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:29.300]   Now what I would like to highlight by way of closing thought is not so much Judas,
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:37.300]   because there is still nevertheless Jesus who is exhibiting incredible amounts of composure.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.300]   What I'm trying to say is, today, although it is Silent Wednesday,
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.300]   let us not just simply think about Judas the sinner, the betrayer,
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:50.300]   one who is, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, it must have been better for you not to have been born,"
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.300]   because woe is the one who would betray the Son of God.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   But let's actually focus on the Son of God, who is to be appreciated for His incredible composure.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   When I think about the events leading up to this week,
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:11.300]   I mean, I think about like Jesus knowing what He knows in terms of what is filled in the heart of man.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   Jesus knew all along that there would be a betrayer.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:21.300]   Jesus knows when people are asking Him questions, "Tell us, Jesus. Show us a sign, Jesus."
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:25.300]   He knows what is contained in the heart of all those who would ask Him and accuse Him.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   When He is walking into the city in Jerusalem, all these individuals praising Him and giving Him branches,
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   He knows what's in their heart.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:46.300]   When He is debating, when He is engaged in all the teaching and the debates and the fierce combats with the scribes of the day,
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.300]   He knows what's in their hearts.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:55.300]   And while Judas thinks He's secretly going and making a deal, is Jesus not aware?
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   Jesus is absolutely aware.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:05.300]   Tomorrow, during the Passover, Jesus calls it out, "He whose hand is on the table with Me will betray Me."
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.300]   And all the disciples are like, "Not me. Not me."
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   And He could have easily said, "And you will deny Me, and you will run, and you will..."
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.300]   But the composure.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:23.300]   When I reflect on the passages when Jesus says, "I did not come to judge,"
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:28.300]   every single step of the way, I'm sitting there thinking, "Thank You, Lord, because if I were You,
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.300]   I would sit there and call out every single person.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   You liar! You two-faced!" Right?
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:46.300]   And then even here, to be aware that Judas is doing this, and then has the audacity come with the rest of the disciples
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   to share in the meal where Jesus is instituting the new covenant,
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:56.300]   and He's explaining to them, "This is My body broken, My blood shed for you."
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.300]   Can you imagine?
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:04.300]   I can't imagine that. I can't imagine, like, sometimes you put yourself in the shoes,
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:09.300]   thinking that this is the bread broken for you, and you would just look and be like, "Not you."
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.300]   And then you just move on.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:19.300]   We thank the Lord. Lord, thank You that You did not come first to judge,
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.300]   but You came first to show mercy.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.300]   And so, Scripture talks about the greatness of Christ.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:32.300]   1 Peter 2, verse 21-24, says, "For you have been called for this purpose,
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:37.300]   since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.300]   who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.300]   And while being reviled, He did not revile in return.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.300]   While suffering, He uttered no threats."
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.300]   And then I would add, "While being betrayed."
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:56.300]   Right? "While being betrayed, He did not react,
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.300]   but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   And He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross,
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.300]   so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.300]   For by His wounds, you were healed."
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   Amen.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.300]   Let us continue to reflect and recognize,
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   when Christ entered into that scene and was going to the cross,
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:29.300]   the scene is horrific because there's just so much corruption, waywardness, and sin around Him.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   And what would feel natural if you put yourself in His shoes would be,
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.300]   "You should just judge all of them right now."
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:42.300]   And so we praise Christ, and we pray in appreciation.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:48.300]   What great composure, what great dedication to fulfill Your merciful, saving grace.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.300]   Let's take time now to pray.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.300]   Would you take a moment to examine your heart?
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.300]   Is there any greedy expectation?
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.300]   Is there any grumbling complaint upon Christ, disappointment in your heart?
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.300]   But also, let's quickly turn that around to say to the Lord,
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.300]   "God, we appreciate every aspect of what You've done,
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.300]   even making sure that You walk through all of these necessary steps,
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.300]   so that the Scripture would be fulfilled,
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   but that Your mercy would be fulfilled upon the cross."
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.300]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:41.300]   [Praying in silence]
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:44:09.300]   [Praying in silence]
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:19.300]   [Praying in silence]
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:29.300]   [Praying in silence]
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:46.300]   [Praying in silence]
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.300]   Let us rise for the closing song.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.300]   [Praying in silence]
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.300]   [Music]
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:07.300]   Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   But fall in His wonderful face
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:28.300]   And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   In the light of His glory and grace
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:49.300]   Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:59.300]   But fall in His wonderful face
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:10.300]   And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:21.300]   In the light of His glory and grace
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:30.300]   Turn your eyes upon Jesus
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:40.300]   But fall in His wonderful face
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:52.300]   And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:47:02.300]   In the light of His glory and grace
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:08.300]   [Music]
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.300]   Amen. Let's pray together.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:15.300]   Our God, as we reflect upon truly Your work,
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.300]   and all the things that You have accomplished,
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.300]   we also reflect upon the fact that in Your great humility,
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.300]   You have chosen to take such a path
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.300]   that would cause you to experience the humiliation
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.300]   to allow yourself to be betrayed by a simple human being.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.300]   It's beyond our comprehension, Lord.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.300]   And so, God, we praise You and thank You.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.300]   And, Lord, I pray, God, that these moments of review
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.300]   would be to us nourishment,
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.300]   that God, from remembering, we would adore You.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.300]   And I pray, Father God, that not only in this moment,
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.300]   but regularly throughout our day,
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.300]   You would cause us to walk with You in such a way, God,
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.300]   that we're lifting up to You our praise and thankfulness
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.300]   every moment of the day, Lord.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   We thank You. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.300]   Thank you, everyone. Have a great evening.
