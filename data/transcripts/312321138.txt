[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360]   All right, welcome.
[00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.600]   Go ahead and find a seat,
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.400]   if you guys haven't done so already.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.200]   You guys are in our OLT survey,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.560]   if you guys haven't already figured that out.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.880]   A couple of my small group guys this past Wednesday
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.280]   actually were sharing about the difficulty
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   of the Old Testament.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.000]   One guy was saying, you know, every year,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Proverbs to Malachi, I just get stuck.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.280]   Another guy was saying, my Bible reading plan,
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.040]   because if you guys were here for Colossians,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.640]   one of the questions was about the Word of God.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.520]   And one of our brothers in my small group was saying,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.680]   you know, like, I would love to read and do the Bible plan,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.340]   but the Old Testament is very daunting.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.080]   Do you guys know about what percent
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.780]   of the Bible is the Old Testament?
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.980]   Word wise, it's like three quarters.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.400]   So if you don't like to touch the three quarters
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.620]   of the book that are a little bit unfamiliar,
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.220]   then you're basically not reading intently
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.620]   75% of the Bible.
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.780]   And so what my goal for our class and our time together
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.540]   is that you're not scared of the OT
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.380]   and that you're familiar enough
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.760]   to try to tackle this on your own.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.660]   My goal for this class is not information.
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.300]   Some of you guys are like, dude, give me the information.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.460]   No, the goal of this class is long-term retention
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.900]   so that for the rest of your life,
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.900]   you can look at the Old Testament and just enjoy.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.300]   And if you guys do Bible reading plans,
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.540]   you're stuck in the Old Testament for a long time, right?
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.060]   I did one last year,
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.900]   and I didn't get to Matthew until October 5th.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.700]   So for the first nine months of my 2018,
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.780]   I was in the Old Testament.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.660]   I mean, and I enjoy it.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.940]   And so my hope is that you guys
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.420]   will learn to enjoy it also.
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.480]   What's this picture up here?
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.140]   You guys might've been wondering, like, dude,
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.740]   you guys, you should've put like a picture
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.440]   of the tribe of Israel or like Moses.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.060]   Why is there a skeleton there?
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.400]   It's on purpose.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.140]   So the goal of this class
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.620]   is basically to give you a skeleton.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.900]   And then the rest of your life,
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.780]   you're filling in the muscles, the meat, the bones,
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.780]   or the nerves, the organs.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.220]   I'm gonna give you a framework by which to work,
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.860]   like so that you know what pieces go where,
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.100]   and the rest of your life,
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.780]   it's up to you to just fill in the blanks.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.220]   Okay, does that sound okay?
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.380]   Okay, so I'm giving you basically,
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.740]   we're doing a puzzle, okay?
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.900]   I'm giving you the box,
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.380]   and I'm giving you the,
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.780]   when you start a puzzle, what do you start with?
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.980]   The edges, but before the edges,
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.300]   what do you find, what do you go look for first?
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.380]   The corners.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.060]   So we're gonna give you the corners,
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.600]   and then the edges, and you do the rest.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.980]   And that sometimes takes the longest time.
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.800]   The edges actually go fast in a puzzle, all right?
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.220]   But as long as you have a framework by which to work,
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.780]   everything else, you can take your time in learning.
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.540]   So I will guarantee this, okay?
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.380]   Elder Philip this morning said,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.100]   "Is it gonna be worth my time?
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.700]   "Is this class gonna be fun?
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.140]   "Do you get a money-back guarantee?"
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.060]   I'll give you a money-back guarantee.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.700]   You will, if you actually pay attention,
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.180]   you will enjoy the Old Testament,
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.220]   and you will not be scared of it, okay?
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.460]   I guarantee it, all right?
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.900]   If you feel like at the end of this,
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.940]   "Yeah, this class was not worth my time,"
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.820]   let me know, and I'll give you your $10 back, all right?
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.340]   Okay, so,
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.940]   what is the hardest thing about the Old Testament,
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.320]   you guys, anybody?
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.420]   Anybody?
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.500]   Ohi, what'd you say, it's boring?
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.820]   It is, if you don't know what you're looking at.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.660]   It can be boring, I agree.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.180]   Anybody else?
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.100]   It's really long.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.140]   Jeremiah has the most words of all the books of the Bible.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.660]   It's like every chapter is kind of painful, right?
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.700]   It's long, and the content's not exactly uplifting.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.540]   So it's boring.
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.660]   What else is a challenge about the Old Testament?
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.140]   Historical context is hard, okay?
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.300]   Good, anybody else?
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.260]   Anything different?
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.860]   It's just unfamiliar territory, right?
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.320]   So I'm gonna start out with a little bit of an introduction,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.540]   because I knew people are gonna come a little bit later
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.140]   on this first day.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.060]   Who's this?
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.660]   I mean, if you don't know,
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.940]   the blue letters should help you.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.180]   Who's this?
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.020]   Can you guess?
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.420]   King George, all right?
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.260]   Who's that?
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.060]   George Washington, very good.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.900]   Who's that?
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.140]   Which one?
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.460]   Take a wild guess who the next picture is gonna be.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.660]   W, all right?
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.420]   George, okay?
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.860]   Can you guess who the next one is?
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.700]   Donald Trump, no.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.900]   George, okay?
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.700]   And then,
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.900]   Paul George, all right.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.900]   Now, there were no words except George, okay?
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.300]   But there's a familiarity with these Georges, right?
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.500]   And let's do a little bit of a trivia game, all right?
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.160]   British Commonwealth, which guy?
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.780]   If we're doing like code names, British Commonwealth.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.500]   King George, Palmdale, California.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.100]   Paul George, you can actually,
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.580]   even if you didn't know Paul George,
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.220]   the basketball player was from Palmdale, California,
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.460]   by a process of elimination, you can land there, okay?
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.380]   9/11.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.060]   W, okay?
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.700]   Persian Gulf War.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.380]   HW, you guys are super smart and educated.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.660]   Ronald Reagan.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.900]   Ooh, trick question.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.380]   Huh?
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.020]   - George the monkey?
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.260]   - George, not George the monkey.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.780]   Okay, Ronald Reagan.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.020]   George Sr. was the vice president, okay?
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.900]   How about Man in the Yellow Hat?
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.460]   That's Monkey George, okay?
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.940]   US dollar.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.140]   Washington, Declaration of Independence.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.580]   Washington, Russell Westbrook.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.740]   Paul George, okay, that's a Oklahoma City Thunder teammate,
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.660]   Paul George.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.340]   England.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.420]   Now there's two people in there.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.900]   George Washington and King George.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.900]   Paris, 1940.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.020]   Do a process of elimination.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.260]   Paris, 1940.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.500]   It's not senior.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.540]   But you can limit out most of the rest of them, right?
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.300]   Paris, 1940.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.700]   The very first Curious George was written in Paris, okay?
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.180]   So, Curious George in 1940.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.740]   Hans Augusto Rey.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.300]   That's the writer for Curious George, okay?
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.700]   So you guys learned something new already, all right?
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.980]   So, if the Bible was like this, it'd be no problem.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.580]   But the Bible is not.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.180]   It's many years removed.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.020]   It's a foreign context, so it's very difficult.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.900]   So if I said Samaria,
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.300]   depending on when you think Samaria,
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.900]   it changes the context.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.700]   Samaria is the capital of the Northern Kingdom.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.460]   Samaria could be barren land.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.220]   Samaria could be an area where a bunch of half-breeds live
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.100]   in the New Testament.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.380]   In the Old Testament, it wasn't a mixed race there.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.780]   You guys with me?
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.700]   Israel in Genesis is good.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.020]   The word Israel through most of the Old Testament is good,
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.900]   but when you get to the Kings and Chronicles,
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.380]   the name Israel, is it good or bad?
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.220]   Take a wild guess.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.580]   Bad.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.500]   If we talk about Israel in the New Testament,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.220]   it sometimes is spiritual, it sometimes is physical,
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.380]   so it changes the context.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.020]   Temple, how many were there?
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.940]   Anybody know?
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.140]   How many temples are mentioned in the Bible?
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:48.300]   There are three or four, okay?
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   Depending on what you are thinking of as temple,
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.500]   maybe five, okay?
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.300]   There's Solomon's Temple, there's Zerubbabel's Temple,
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   there's Herod's Temple, there could be Me Temple,
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.940]   could be the temple that is to come.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.500]   So depending on the context,
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.140]   temple means something different.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.860]   What about the word Jeroboam?
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.940]   There are two Jeroboams that are both extremely important.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.500]   So that's not something that's necessarily familiar, right?
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.860]   Or the word Jews.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.620]   If you read Genesis and Exodus,
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.060]   you're not gonna see Jews.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.700]   When do you start seeing the word Jew?
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.220]   Not until the second Kings.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.540]   So for most of the Old Testament,
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.180]   you have no word Jew, okay?
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.740]   So these are the things that you're gonna get familiar with
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.620]   through our time together.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.500]   So hopefully, with our one and a half hours each week,
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.340]   it'll be enough for you to put the bones together
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.900]   and then the rest of your life at your own time
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.300]   and at the pace that you feel comfortable with,
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.020]   you fill in the blanks, okay?
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.740]   So if you just pay attention and do some review,
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.620]   you will know the skeleton of the Old Testament
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.860]   and you will never be scared of it ever again.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.740]   That's a guarantee.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.100]   And what do you get back if it doesn't happen?
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.180]   10 bucks, okay?
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.020]   All right, so anybody know how many books
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.260]   are in the Old Testament?
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.700]   How many books are in the New Testament?
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.100]   If you guys grew up in a church,
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.420]   someone might have taught you kind of an easy way
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.100]   to remember, but I'm gonna review it for you here, okay?
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.500]   Three times nine equals 27.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.420]   That's an easy way to remember the books of the Bible.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.420]   There are 39 Old Testament books, 27 New Testament books.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.460]   No problem, right?
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.500]   And you guys may have already known this.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:48.660]   Okay, 39 Old Testament books, 27 New Testament books.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:55.660]   Now, the first key that we're gonna look at on this page
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.420]   is a division of the Old Testament books, okay?
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.420]   So, I want you guys to repeat with me all right?
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.160]   You guys have to interact,
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.320]   otherwise I feel like a fool about myself, all right?
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.480]   Here we go.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   Just listen a couple times and then follow along.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.180]   Five, 12, five, five, 12, ready?
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.280]   Who's got a memrizer ready?
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.120]   You guys got it down?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.680]   Good, you're well on your way to Old Testament.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.500]   Ready?
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.100]   Five, 12, five, five, 12,
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.940]   five, 12, five, five, 12.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.180]   Shoot, this is recorded, so I'm just gonna be looking like a fool.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.380]   One more time.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.020]   *repeats 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 12, 12*
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.320]   If you guys want to get fancy, you guys like the drums,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.500]   5, 12, 5, 5, 12, you can do that too. Let's try that one, all right? Here we go.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.640]   *responses 5, 12, 5, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 1*
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.800]   *responses 5, 12, 5, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 5, 12,*
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.360]   5 plus 5, 5, 12, 5, 5, 12 equals 39.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.820]   The Old Testament books are divided into
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.540]   *responses 5, 12, 5, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 5, 12,*
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.760]   *responses 5, 12, 5, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 5, 12,*
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.760]   Here we go.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.460]   The first 5 is a Pentateuch.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.260]   Otherwise also known as
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.680]   the Books of Moses,
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.640]   Torah, T-O-R-A-H.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.320]   So some people refer to these as the Books of Moses, some as the Torah.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.160]   Jesus calls all of these 5 books just Moses.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.320]   Okay? So as it is written in Moses and the prophets.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.700]   All right? That's the first 5 books.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.240]   Next 12 are history.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:54.280]   Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st, 2nd Samuel, 1st, 2nd Kings, 1st, 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.120]   Those are the history books.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.020]   Esther was written around the 480s BC.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.740]   Job was written around the 1600s BC.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:11.620]   So you're going from Esther to Job, you're just, you're rewinding 1,200 years.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.780]   And that's what's tricky about the Bible, organizationally.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.340]   It's not chronological, it's genre-based.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.260]   Okay? So if you actually just try to read from Genesis to Malachi,
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.880]   you're skipping times all over the place.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.700]   So that's one of the challenges.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:33.720]   Okay? So just remember, the organization of the books of the Old Testament are genre more
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.520]   than they are chronological.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.680]   Make sense?
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.000]   Okay? 5 books of Moses, 12 history books.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.460]   The next 5 are poetry.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:51.080]   Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Song of Solomon.
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:57.720]   And there are varying times for all 5 of those books.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.560]   The next 5 are the major prophets.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:08.640]   And it's not in terms of importance, it's in terms of the length.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.900]   Okay? The major prophets minus Lamentations, but Lamentations is connected to Jeremiah.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.780]   But there are 4 major prophets in Lamentations, so we're just going to call it 5.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:27.140]   Okay? 5 major long prophets, and then 12 minor prophets.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:34.200]   So when you go from Daniel, the last major prophet, that was written in the 530s,
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.800]   but then when you go to Hosea, you're rewinding back to 780 BC.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.180]   So you're going backward 200 years.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.580]   So if you read Daniel, which in and of itself spans 70 years, those 12 chapters,
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.220]   for like 70 years.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.140]   You go from Daniel and then you go back to Hosea,
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.300]   you get confused.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.280]   Right?
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   So history is important for the study of the Old Testament
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.340]   and I will go over that over the next six weeks.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.640]   So, don't look up at the screen,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.960]   look at my face, okay?
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.800]   Let's practice this song one more time.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   5-12-5-5-12-5-12-5-5-12.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.640]   What's the first five?
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.620]   Pentateuch, 12.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.420]   History, next five.
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.060]   Poetry, next five.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.960]   Major, last 12.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.940]   Minor prophets, no problem, right?
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.060]   Can you guys do this without trying?
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.900]   You guys got it?
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.940]   Pentateuch, 12.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.940]   History, five.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.380]   Poetry, five.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.560]   Major, 12.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.000]   Okay, you're well on your way.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.380]   All right?
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.020]   So this is how we're gonna do every major point
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.080]   in the Old Testament so you guys can kinda remember.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.260]   So, even if you feel kinda cheesy and fruity,
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.240]   just follow along.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.580]   The next Old Testament key, okay?
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:03.220]   Do you guys know what the whole Old Testament points to?
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.620]   Who, what person does the Old Testament point to?
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.700]   The whole Old Testament, it says,
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.820]   in both Luke and the end of John,
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.260]   points to who?
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.500]   Jesus.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.620]   Jesus is known as the great
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.300]   physician, okay?
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.980]   So the Old Testament is broken up in an easy way
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.000]   to remember, think, I am Dr. Jesus.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.380]   Easy?
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.500]   Old Testament points to who?
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.480]   The great physician.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.420]   What's the way to remember?
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.480]   The big picture of the Old Testament?
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.180]   I am Dr. Jesus, okay?
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.900]   So, I'm gonna read a Bible verse
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.060]   so that we have some Bible content in our time together.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.580]   We are Bereans.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.940]   And when Jesus heard it, he said to them,
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.860]   "Those who are well have no need of a physician,
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.780]   "but those who are sick, I came not to call the righteous,
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.060]   "but sinners," okay?
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.540]   Now, I am Dr. Jesus.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.300]   Now, the I is useless in there.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.620]   You really need to start with the A, okay?
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.100]   So you don't need to worry about the I.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.380]   Just remember the A, M, Dr. Jesus,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.580]   and this is what you're supposed to look at.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.580]   We're gonna take it in 500-year chunks,
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.880]   starting from 2000, what's 2000 minus 500?
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.500]   1500, and then another 500, 1000, 500,
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.340]   and then we're getting to Jesus at zero, okay?
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.900]   These are not exact dates, but those are mental landmarks
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.220]   that you can kind of pick out.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.840]   A, you have Abraham.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.660]   1500, you have Moses.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.940]   1000, you have David.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.700]   500, you have the returns, and some people are like,
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.900]   "What the heck is that?
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.620]   "I will get to it," all right?
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.300]   But returns, plural, okay, 'cause there are three.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.300]   Returns, and zero is, AD is Jesus, okay?
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.820]   Now, everybody, don't look at the screen.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.380]   Look at my nose, okay?
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.020]   My wife says my nose is probably the best feature.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.020]   I agree, it's cute, all right, here we go.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.840]   2000, who are we thinking of?
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.600]   1500, M.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.940]   1000, D.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:21.520]   500, returns, and zero is Jesus.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.780]   Easy?
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.020]   Okay, five, 12, five, five, 12.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:32.020]   Torah, history, poetry, major, minor.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.340]   Okay, I'm not gonna include the prophets,
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.040]   but just major, minor, all right?
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.980]   2000, Abraham, 1500.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.620]   Moses, 1000.
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.100]   David, 500.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.220]   Returns, zero, Jesus.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.540]   The goal is not information.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.060]   What's our goal for this class?
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.420]   Long-term retention, so just try to store that
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.560]   into your hard drive, okay?
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.980]   Here we go.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.980]   Abraham, Moses, David, returns, Jesus.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.100]   How many of you guys feel like you could ace this test
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.260]   if you took the genres of the Bible,
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.420]   the books of the Bible?
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.620]   How many books of the Old Testament?
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.860]   How many books in the New?
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.300]   What, how do you remember the five divisions?
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.540]   (imitates beatboxing)
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.180]   Right, that's how you remember.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.580]   I am Dr. Jesus, Old Testament, Abraham, Moses,
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.340]   David, returns, Jesus, fantastic.
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.660]   You guys all get an A+ so far.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.820]   Give yourselves a hand.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.340]   You guys have to participate, okay?
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.840]   If I say give yourselves a hand.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.580]   (audience laughs)
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.580]   All right, 2000 to 1500, you have Genesis, Exodus,
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.180]   Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, okay?
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.180]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.660]   no problems there because usually when you start
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.020]   reading your Bible, these get read up until you get
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.660]   to Numbers and Deuteronomy and then they get skimmed.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.260]   And then by the time you get to Joshua,
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.540]   then they get forgotten a lot of times, right?
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.740]   I've probably read the book of Genesis more than any
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.740]   other book in my whole life.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.380]   And I'm sure that's not uncommon, okay?
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.140]   'Cause Genesis is fun.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:12.140]   Exodus is halfway fun and then it starts getting confusing.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.660]   All right, but those five books, we're not gonna spend
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.900]   too much time, but with each of the 39 books of the Bible
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.260]   during the next six weeks, I'm gonna give you a key
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.100]   to remember the main theme for each book.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.700]   So that when you actually go to study it on your own,
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.940]   it's not a daunting task.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.440]   What do you see in the middle?
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.340]   A big N, right?
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:42.260]   So the key to remember Genesis is big N-ings, okay?
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.660]   Big N-ings.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.780]   And this isn't just about the cosmos,
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.700]   but who was the first audience that received
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.560]   the book of Genesis, do you guys know?
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.460]   The people in the wilderness, because who wrote this book?
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.580]   Moses, he gave it to the people in the wilderness.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.120]   After the wilderness, he was gone, all right?
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.440]   So they probably were wondering,
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.860]   where did we all come from?
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.220]   How did we end up here?
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.740]   'Cause everybody's under 40 years old,
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.700]   except for three people.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.380]   How in the world did we end up here
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.180]   and we're all our elderly people, except you three, okay?
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.620]   So you are tracing backward in Genesis.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.720]   The most ink is devoted to Joseph,
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.940]   because that answers the question,
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.860]   how did we get here, into this wilderness, right?
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.860]   And then you go back and farther and farther,
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.240]   and then you get the creation account,
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.000]   which is only like two chapters, okay?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.620]   The more ink in the Old Testament
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.220]   that's devoted to a section or a theme,
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.420]   the more it is important, so kinda keep that in mind.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.420]   So Joseph's story is probably the main theme
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.500]   or purpose for the book of Genesis, not creation.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.220]   Even though you can get creation-related things
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.260]   from the book of Genesis, but it's about beginnings.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.540]   The beginnings of the people of God,
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.700]   the beginnings of the universe, okay?
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.780]   So the first verse says, "In the beginning, God created."
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.920]   So Genesis is no problem because you guys all know, okay?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   But as we track through Malachi, Zephaniah, Zechariah,
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.780]   these pictures are gonna start to help, okay?
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.940]   But we're gonna do eight today.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.060]   The second one, what's this picture of?
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.380]   Exit from, what's in the background?
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:39.040]   Pyramids, camels, Egypt, okay?
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.980]   So no problem, exit from Egypt is what
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.220]   the book of Exodus is mainly about.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   The next book, what's this guy got on his hands?
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:04.240]   On one hand, he has money, not chicken, he has food,
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.880]   okay, he has food and money, okay?
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.720]   Think feasts and offerings, all right?
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.760]   The big question for Leviticus is how does a sinful man
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.480]   relate to a holy God and what is prescribed
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.200]   are a lot of feasts and offerings.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.680]   So the guy's getting his left foot kissed, all right?
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.160]   So that's how you remember Leviticus, left foot kiss.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.720]   Leviticus, okay?
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.080]   Sounds a little bit profane, left foot kiss, all right?
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.000]   And then you'll remember feasts and offerings,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.640]   how does sinful man relate to holy God?
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:48.320]   The next book is numbers.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.500]   And what are these numbers doing?
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:58.200]   They are wandering, are they wandering in a mall?
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.660]   Are they wandering in the ocean?
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.920]   Where are they wandering?
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.200]   In wilderness, okay?
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   The book of Numbers is about wanderings, okay?
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.360]   So what you wanna write down is numbers
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.100]   wandering in the wilderness.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.300]   Numbers wandering in the wilderness.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:30.140]   And then there's a duet here, running on a me.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.560]   You guys get that?
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.400]   (mimics drum roll)
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.900]   Okay, duet run on me.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.160]   Okay, that's how you remember duet run on me.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.900]   And it says second law, okay?
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.860]   There are no two laws, but it's a second generation
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.860]   of those who receive the law, okay?
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.980]   So the key you wanna write down is duet run on me
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.860]   and the law of God to the second generation.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:04.820]   Everybody that left Exodus, or everyone that left Egypt
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.780]   with the exception of three people are currently dead.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:15.340]   Joshua is alive, Caleb is alive, Moses is alive.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.180]   Everyone else over 40, gone, dead, okay?
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.740]   There is some overlap between numbers and duet run on me.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.400]   If you read it, it kinda seems like it should be one book.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.220]   All right?
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.240]   The book of Numbers, to remember it simply is this.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.660]   It's basically like the number of people
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.340]   wandering in the wilderness, and why are they wandering?
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.860]   The book of Numbers basically says
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.500]   they are wandering because of their sin, okay?
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.220]   Duet run on me is written right before they enter
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.780]   into the promised land like a contract.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.380]   Now, all of your people died, so I am Yahweh.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.460]   If you obey me, these are the blessings.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.700]   If you disobey me, these are the curses.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.620]   So it's written like a contract, the book of duet run on me.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.540]   It talks about things about how many horses
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.900]   a king should have, if there should even be a king.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.580]   It even says in the day you ask for a king,
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.500]   this is what kind of king you need to have.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.140]   Duet run on me has a contract between man and God, okay?
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.460]   To the second generation.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.540]   But in the book of duet run on me, what's interesting is
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.140]   the reason for the Israelites wandering is not their sin.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.220]   The Bible says in duet run on me eight,
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.860]   the reason the people of God are wandering
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.660]   is because God's putting them to test.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.220]   So if you only read the book of Numbers,
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.020]   you're like, dude, Israel sucks.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.020]   But if you're looking at duet run on me,
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.480]   It's like, dude, God sucks
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.780]   'cause he just threw them into the wilderness like that.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.660]   If numbers is the fact,
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.760]   Deuteronomy serves as a commentary
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.680]   from God's perspective on the facts.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.360]   Nod your head if that makes sense.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.860]   This is what we're gonna do.
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.320]   We're gonna do a quick review.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.760]   Five, 12, five, five, 12,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.020]   five, 12, five, five, 12.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.320]   First five is what?
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   Pentateuch, 12, history,
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.980]   and then the next five?
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.560]   Poetry, five, major prophets, 12, minor prophets.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.520]   And what's the long way to think,
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.060]   big picture of the Old Testament?
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.080]   I am Dr. Jesus, 2,000.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.020]   Abraham, 1,500.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.620]   Moses, 1,000.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.620]   David, 500.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.820]   Returns, and zero?
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.160]   Jesus, okay.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.780]   What's the book of Genesis about?
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.160]   Beginnings, exit us.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.320]   Egypt, exit from Egypt.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.560]   Leviticus, left foot kiss.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.120]   Feast and offerings, okay.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   Numbers, wilderness wandering,
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.760]   Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.180]   God's word to the second generation.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.180]   Easy enough?
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.720]   Now, find a partner and go over these questions.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.060]   I'm gonna give you three minutes, all right?
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.520]   Find a partner, and you're gonna switch partners.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.360]   So if you're like, dude, this person on my left is nice.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   I don't like this person.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.780]   You're gonna have to hit up both eventually, all right?
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.520]   So find a partner and review.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.360]   Review.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:39.360]   I hear the cheers, I like it.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.600]   (coughing)
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.760]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.920]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.080]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.240]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.560]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:19.820]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.980]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.140]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.120]   I'm gonna give you one more minute.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:30:09.960]   30 more seconds, 30 more seconds.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:17.160]   If your partner made a mistake,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.560]   call 'em out on it and let me know who they are
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.400]   so we can shame them.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   I am Asian.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.200]   All right, 10 more seconds.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:38.640]   All right.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.900]   2,000 to 1,500 is pretty easy
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:48.560]   because it's just mostly the five books of Moses, okay?
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.500]   1,500 to 1,000 is also pretty easy
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.200]   because there's not much in there
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.760]   that you necessarily need to remember, all right?
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.320]   Now, there's a little bit of an offensive thing there.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.240]   It's a yo mama joke, all right?
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.160]   Now, we don't endorse yo mama jokes
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.520]   'cause usually they're not nice,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.260]   but usually they're said in jest, right?
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.360]   So the next key that I want you guys to remember is
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.200]   1,500 Mount JK, okay?
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.540]   What's MT mean?
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.960]   Usually MT stands for Mountain,
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.040]   and what's JK stand for?
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.080]   Just kidding, all right?
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.120]   You millennials, here we go.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.840]   1,500 Mount JK, got it?
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.120]   5, 12, 5, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 5, 12.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.760]   I am Dr. Jesus, Mount JK, okay?
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.760]   The Mount JK
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.840]   is the J.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:51.420]   M stands for Moses 'cause we're starting at 1,500.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.440]   The T, tribes.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.960]   That's all you need to remember.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.280]   The division of the tribes, life in the tribes,
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:05.040]   tribal conflict, tribal warfare, tribes, okay?
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.000]   And then the J is judges.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.920]   And these judges are the ones leading the tribes,
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.640]   but that's the next thing you need to remember.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.840]   Tribes and then judges, and then kings,
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.000]   and that's all you need to remember, really,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.520]   from 1,500 to 1,000.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.440]   So you've got Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.200]   Deuteronomy, and then you have Moses is your marker,
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.800]   and then there's a time of judges
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.200]   that lasts for about 400 years,
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.000]   and there's tribes in there until you get to the kings.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.720]   And from the kings on, it's 50% of your Bible.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.160]   From the first appearance of Saul, the king,
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.960]   to Malachi is half your Bible.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.880]   So we will get there, okay?
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.740]   So what's the way to remember 1,500 to 1,000?
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.600]   Your mama is so dumb that she tried to climb up Mountain
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.760]   Dew, okay?
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.180]   But just think Mountain JK, okay?
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.960]   So think of that your mama joke.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   Don't use it, okay, just think of that
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.040]   just to help you remember this to the glory of God, all right?
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.120]   So 1,500, you have Moses, but after Moses,
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.240]   you really only need to concern yourself
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.680]   with the tribes and then who?
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   Judges until you get to the last judge/first king, Saul.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:34.080]   Saul was not really like a king.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.320]   He ruled like a judge, okay?
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.120]   So that was Israel's choice for a king,
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.000]   but they wanted a nice judge, and he was tall, he's handsome
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.200]   but God's first choice for a real spiritual king was David,
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.680]   and we'll get there, okay?
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   So Mount JK, Moses, tribes, judges, kings.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:05.680]   So basically from 2,000 to 1,000,
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.680]   from Abraham to David, you can kind of be like,
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:15.760]   okay, these are the things that are going on.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.480]   I don't need to worry about the details,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.400]   but this is the theme, okay?
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.120]   So, so far so good?
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.820]   Easy to remember?
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.720]   This is the book of Joshua.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:30.280]   Just remember General Joshua.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.760]   And what's he standing over?
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.800]   What's he conquering?
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.520]   That's Jericho, actually, okay, all the walls.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.080]   Joshua bought the battle of Jericho, Jericho, right?
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.720]   So it's Jericho, he's squishing on it, okay?
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   So Joshua is general, and after they conquer,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.640]   they break up into tribes, and then they get land.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.040]   You guys, that's easy to follow enough, right?
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   Okay, so you just wanna remember General Joshua
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.480]   and conquest.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:11.800]   How did the Israelites get their land?
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.720]   How are they divided?
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.840]   What were the barrier marks?
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.080]   What were the borders?
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.680]   That's all you really need to know.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.080]   Where do these tribes dwell?
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:28.120]   Joshua is 10 years only, but it's 24 chapters.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.720]   So it's 10 years, but it's 24 chapters.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.560]   So there's a fast, action-paced,
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.620]   action-packed book is Joshua, 10 years.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.320]   The book of Judges, on the other hand,
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.040]   is 21 chapters, but it's 400 years, okay?
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.760]   So you're going from extremely specific in Joshua
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.160]   to extremely redundant, repetitive,
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.360]   and general and broad in Judges.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.320]   So Judges, you have cycles.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.200]   And you have a judge on a cycle.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   Easy to remember.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.400]   Judges on cycles.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:09.040]   Now for you ladies and your married men,
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.880]   cycles is a negative word, okay?
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.360]   So just remember it as a negative word, cycles, okay?
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.320]   Joshua was 24 chapters in how many years?
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.240]   10.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:24.920]   Judges is 21 chapters in 400 years.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.740]   So that's 40 times the number of years that have passed,
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:33.420]   but less ink, okay?
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.540]   So Judges, you just wanna remember Judges on a cycle, cycles.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:43.300]   So 1500 to 1000, you remember Moses,
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.700]   and then Mount JK.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.300]   Tribes, and then Judges.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.180]   Kings.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.420]   What are these cycles?
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.340]   The fourth key is five Rs.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.060]   And there's a logical procession,
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.060]   logical continuance in this five Rs,
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.300]   so it's not gonna be hard to remember,
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.500]   but there are five R words that you need to remember.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.020]   The first one is rest.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.300]   Rest.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:21.100]   The second R is relapse.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.100]   You're chilling, and then you find yourself
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.340]   in a bad situation, and then you fall into sin again.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.980]   Relapse.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.420]   The third R, ruin.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:37.580]   Relapse leads to ruin, usually,
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.660]   for any kind of an addict, right?
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.500]   Ruin.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.020]   But usually people who are broken,
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.620]   and like humbled, and discouraged,
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.740]   and want change, what do they do?
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.820]   They repent, repentance.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:59.820]   And then God raises up a judge to restoration, number five.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.740]   So rest.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.900]   Relapse.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.020]   Ruin.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.300]   Repentance.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.500]   And restoration.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:21.340]   For 400 years, again, and again, and again,
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.620]   they're doing fine, and then they fall into idolatry,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.740]   and then they get ruined, and then they are conquered
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:30.380]   and oppressed by the Midianites, by the Philistines,
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.820]   and then they repent, and then God raises up a judge.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.300]   And the judges are from all kinds of tribes, okay?
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.380]   So you have judges from Benjamin,
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.660]   there are judges from Manasseh,
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.500]   there's judges from Ephraim, there are judges from Reuben.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:53.220]   The judges just seemingly just pop up, okay?
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:58.220]   So when they're at rest, they forget God, and what happens?
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.620]   They relapse into their idolatrous ways,
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.460]   that idolatry leads to their ruin,
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.660]   then they repent, and they go, "Lord, we have forgotten you,"
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.260]   and then God raises up a judge, and they're restored.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:18.260]   And you'll see this phrase in the book of Judges
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.300]   repeated at least four times.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.340]   "In those days, Israel had no king.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.380]   "Everyone did as he saw fit."
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.980]   Judges 17, six, Judges 21, 25,
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.460]   it's mentioned in Judges 18 and Judges 19.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.540]   "In those days, Israel had no king.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.340]   "Everyone did as they saw fit."
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.580]   Judges 17, six, Judges 21, 25, okay?
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.780]   So Genesis was about what?
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:50.380]   Genesis is beginnings.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:55.020]   Exodus, exiting from Egypt, Leviticus,
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.980]   feast and offerings, numbers,
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.060]   wilderness wanderings, Deu Adronami,
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.380]   second generation, the law of God of the second generation,
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.380]   Joshua, conquest, how many years?
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.020]   Only 10.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.860]   Judges, how many years?
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.900]   400, but all you need to remember
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.980]   are these cycles for these 400 years,
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.540]   because in those days, Israel had no king,
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.100]   everyone did as they saw fit.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.820]   They went from rest to relapse to ruin
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.380]   to repentance to restoration,
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.700]   again and again and again and again and again.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.820]   But there is an interesting story
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.660]   that happens in the time of Judges
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.300]   that's based mostly on a woman who's a foreigner.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.860]   You guys know who that is?
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.860]   The book of Ruth.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.700]   Book on a roof, okay?
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.820]   So just think Ruth.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.620]   It's a love story that happens in this time of Judges.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.940]   Oh, you can't see?
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.060]   Is my head in the way?
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.140]   Ruth.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:10.620]   Here we go, how many books in the Old Testament?
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.980]   39, how many books in the New?
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.500]   27, chronological or genre?
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.660]   Genre, 512, 5512.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.700]   Pentateuch?
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:29.220]   History, poetry, major, minor.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.220]   Easy enough to remember.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:36.220]   Abraham, 1500 is Moses, 1000 is David,
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.020]   500 is returns, three, okay?
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.300]   Zero is Jesus.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.020]   Let's start from 2000 to 1500.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.100]   What's Genesis about?
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.700]   Beginnings, Exodus.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.420]   Exiting Egypt, Leviticus.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.260]   Feast and offerings, numbers, wilderness wanderings,
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.180]   Deuteronomy.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:58.740]   Good, you've got 2000 to 1500 to set, no problem.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.980]   A through M, no worries.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.580]   M through D, you've got Mount JK, okay?
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:08.620]   Moses, tribes, Judges, kings,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.300]   and you have three books in there.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:16.380]   Joshua is about conquest and the tribes, okay?
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.980]   10 years, 24 chapters.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.780]   Judges is about cycles.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.900]   400 years, 21 chapters,
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.740]   and these cycles involve rest,
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:35.340]   relapse, ruin, repentance, restoration,
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.460]   and in that is a story about God's promise
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:43.460]   to restore his people through a family of his choosing.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.220]   And what's that story called?
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.420]   The book of Ruth, Ruth, okay?
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.900]   So here we go.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.300]   Thinking our way through.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:58.580]   Abraham to Moses is a Pentateuch.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.820]   1500 to 1000 you have, tribes, Judges, kings,
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.620]   and that's all you need to remember.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:09.380]   And in the middle of this you have five Rs.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:15.340]   Raise your hand if you're already feeling
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.940]   a little bit more comfortable with the Old Testament.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:18.780]   Yeah?
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.060]   'Cause we're halfway done.
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.020]   Okay?
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.380]   That's all you need to really remember.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.380]   And the rest of your life you fill in the blanks, okay?
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:31.140]   So in your groups, again, now find a different partner.
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:31.980]   Review.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.220]   We're gonna review this so much
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.740]   that you're gonna dream this.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.220]   And you're gonna hear my voice going,
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.740]   five, 12, five, five, 12, five, 12.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.820]   You know, your mama's always do,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.100]   but she climbed a mountain, do.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.660]   You're gonna hear all of this in your head
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.500]   for the rest of your life.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.340]   So good luck with that.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.540]   But go ahead and practice with a different neighbor.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.580]   If you haven't met him, just introduce yourself
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.540]   and go over the next six questions.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:44:03.780]   And once you finish, we're gonna take a break 'til 1125.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.860]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.940]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.020]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.100]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:19.180]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.260]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.420]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.700]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.780]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:40.260]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:49.260]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:56.260]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.300]   (audience murmuring)
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:08.300]   (audience murmuring)
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   (audience murmuring)
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:24.300]   (audience murmuring)
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:55.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:46:00.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:15.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:47:07.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:27.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:47.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:48:07.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:29.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:51.340]   - One minute, one minute, grab your snack,
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.340]   grab your brains, come back.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.340]   All right, 20 seconds, if you're standing up,
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:18.340]   find your way back to your seats, and we're almost done.
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.340]   (audience murmuring)
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:37.340]   So hopefully now, with half of the Old Testament
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:42.340]   now in your head, hopefully you're not as scared, okay?
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:48.340]   You don't need to remember every single person,
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:53.340]   who Rahum is, who Shimshai, who like, you know,
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:56.340]   Nebulad, all these people, you don't need to know
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.340]   who they are, okay?
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.340]   They will come in time, but as long as you're not scared
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.340]   of these books, you will know that it's okay
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   some places to read quickly, and then some places
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.340]   you're gonna wanna slow down, all right?
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.340]   Now we're gonna go over a cheer that I taught
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.340]   the college students in the summer, that I taught
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:22.340]   at Berean in 2007, that'll help you remember
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.340]   half your Bible, okay?
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:30.340]   And you're gonna hear this every week, 'til you die,
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:34.340]   in your head, narrated by me, okay?
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.340]   This will help you remember half of your Bible.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:39.340]   What percent?
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.340]   Half, I actually did the math, 51%,
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.340]   this timeline that I'm gonna give you,
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.340]   the cheer that I'm gonna give you is 51%
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:52.340]   of all of the Bible, in terms of landmarks, okay?
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.340]   So you have to engage, you have to
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:52:00.340]   just pay attention, okay?
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:06.340]   It's on your paper here, all right?
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:10.340]   But the first things you need to remember are
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.340]   King, King, split.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.340]   All right, go.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   - King, King, split.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.340]   - One more time.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.340]   - King, King, split.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.340]   - Five, 12, five, five?
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.340]   - Five.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.340]   - Five, blank, five?
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.340]   What's in the blank?
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.340]   - Five.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.340]   - Good, what's between the King and the split?
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.340]   - A King.
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:29.340]   - A King, oh, good job, all right?
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.340]   King, King, split is easy to remember, okay?
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.340]   And if you guys are already familiar
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.340]   with a little bit of your Bible,
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.340]   the people of God get divided into
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.340]   northern and southern kingdoms,
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:45.340]   that's the split, there's a civil war that happens, okay?
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:50.340]   So King, David, King, Solomon, split,
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.340]   that's what happens, okay?
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:58.340]   So King, King, split, ABCD.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:03.340]   This used to be just ABC until when I taught it in 2007,
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.340]   Dr. Pang was like, "You should include a D there."
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.340]   So I did, okay?
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.340]   There is a D, okay?
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:14.340]   So King, King, split, and what's the next four?
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.340]   ABCD, easy to remember and hard?
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.340]   - Easy.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.340]   - Yeah, if it was hard, you'd have some problems, okay?
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:25.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, no problem?
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.340]   All right, here we go.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:33.340]   Medo-Persians, repeat, Medo-Persians, all right?
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:36.340]   So I've given you all these easy things to remember
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.340]   and then I've given you Medo-Persians.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:42.340]   So Persians is easy to remember, but what is Medo?
[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.340]   Okay, we'll get there.
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:52.340]   So King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians,
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.340]   and you'll be familiar with this one, return.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.340]   And Greeks, all right?
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:03.340]   So I'm gonna go slowly and then I'm gonna go louder,
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.340]   I mean, I'm gonna go slowly and then faster and louder.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.340]   Yes, David?
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:12.340]   I will tell you, okay?
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.340]   Let's do the cheer first, all right?
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.340]   Here we go.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:24.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.340]   It's like a cheer.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.340]   I feel like this was divine.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.340]   I was listening to sports radio and I was trying to figure out
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.340]   how I'm gonna teach this.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:35.340]   King, King, split, ABC, oh, and it was like a, like, ah, moment.
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.340]   Okay?
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.340]   And this is international now.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.340]   I've taught this in China, I've taught this in Korea.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:40.340]   Okay, here we go.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:48.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.340]   Do some of you older members remember this?
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.340]   Okay?
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:59.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:04.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:08.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.340]   Okay, with your eyes closed so that you can hear my voice
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.340]   even louder in your head.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.340]   Ready?
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:18.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:22.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:26.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.340]   College students, ready, go.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.340]   [Audience reading]
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.340]   Bam, go.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:38.340]   [Audience laughing]
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:39.340]   People over 35, go.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:44.340]   [Audience laughing]
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.340]   Everybody with glasses, go.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:50.340]   [Audience laughing]
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.340]   Laker fans, go.
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:56.340]   [Audience laughing]
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.340]   Youth, I'm just kidding, Mary.
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:59.340]   There's only one, okay?
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:06.340]   King, King, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.340]   What's Joshua about?
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.340]   How many years?
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:12.340]   What are the five Rs?
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.340]   Rest, relapse, re--
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.340]   [Audience laughing]
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.340]   I'm testing you.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.340]   I'm doing these things on purpose.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.340]   What's Exodus about?
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.340]   All right.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.340]   What happens in a thousand?
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:30.340]   Oh, I'm switching it up.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.340]   I'm rewiring the neurons.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.340]   What happens in 500?
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.340]   How many returns are there?
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.340]   Three, but for the cheer, we just say return.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.340]   The S is hard to say.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.340]   I've tried it.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.340]   Okay.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:48.340]   What is happening between 1500 to a thousand?
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:53.340]   Moses, tribes, five Rs, kings.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:56.340]   Who was the last judge, first king?
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:57.340]   Saul, okay?
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:00.340]   But for our king, king, split, it doesn't start with Saul,
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.340]   because that's not God's choice.
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.340]   Who do we start with?
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.340]   David, okay?
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.340]   And when is David?
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.340]   Thousand, okay?
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:13.340]   So, what is the cheer to remember half your Bible,
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.340]   including the New Testament too?
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:21.340]   King, king, split, ABCD, Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.340]   Here we go.
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.340]   King is at a thousand and ten.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.340]   So, that's easy to remember.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.340]   And what's easy about the three first kings of Israel,
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:36.340]   about the United Kingdom, there were three kings only,
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:40.340]   Saul, David, and Solomon all did 40 years,
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:42.340]   except, well, Saul did 42,
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.340]   but just to evenly round up in your head,
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:50.340]   just think of Saul 40, David 40, Solomon 40 split, okay?
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:53.340]   So, 40, 40, 40 is all you need to remember.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:57.340]   So, if you go backward, when was Saul king?
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.340]   1050-ish, okay?
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.340]   We're not starting with Saul,
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.340]   but if you wanted to mentally go back into,
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.340]   when was Saul king?
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.340]   When was Samuel prophet?
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.340]   You just need to just start with a thousand
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.340]   and go backward 40, okay?
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:18.340]   So, here's your first king, that's David.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:24.340]   Second king at 970 is his son Solomon.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:28.340]   At 930, you have the split, the Civil War.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.340]   It gets divided north and south,
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:36.340]   and we'll look at the Civil War more next week, okay?
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.340]   King, king split.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:43.340]   How many of you think you guys can remember these dates?
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.340]   They're easy enough, right?
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.340]   Because how many years for each king?
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.340]   40, 40, 40.
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.340]   Well, 42, 40, 40, okay?
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.340]   And you start at about a thousand,
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.340]   plus or minus 10, and then you're good.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.340]   Actually, no, plus 10, not minus 10.
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.340]   No, minus 10, you're going backward.
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:02.340]   60, 80, it'll mess you up a little bit, all right?
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.340]   King, king split.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.340]   So, what year did the split happen?
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:11.340]   930, and that's historical fact, okay?
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.340]   What year was Judah's first king, you think?
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:17.340]   Judah's first king, the Southern Kingdom.
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.340]   930.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.340]   How about Israel's first king?
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.340]   930, okay?
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:25.340]   When they split, there now are two kings.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.340]   And one thing you'll notice,
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:30.340]   and I'm gonna give this to you more in depth next week,
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:33.340]   but the kings and the chronicles, the books of the Bible,
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.340]   there's an overlap, okay?
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.340]   If you actually go through 1 and 2 Kings,
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.340]   and then you're in 1 Chronicles again,
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.340]   and you go back to David,
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:45.340]   and then you see the same stories repeat themselves, okay?
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.340]   The kings are about everybody.
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.340]   The chronicles are just about the South.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:51.340]   Kings are about everybody.
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.340]   Chronicles are about Judah.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.340]   And we'll look into that more next week.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.340]   But the split happens what year?
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.340]   930, okay?
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.340]   So King-King split, and here we go, Professor Mobley,
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.340]   your question.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.340]   A is Assyria.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.340]   A-S-S-Y-R-I-A, Assyria.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:17.340]   And I'm putting these dates on purpose.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.340]   When you have a chance, try to memorize them,
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:23.340]   and I will help you memorize them as we go.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:27.340]   Assyria, 612 is B, Babylon.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:33.340]   C, captivity.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:39.340]   D, destruction of the temple.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:45.340]   A, Assyria.
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:50.340]   B, Babylon, Babylon.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:53.340]   C, captivity.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.340]   D, destruction of the temple.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:00.340]   So David, Solomon, Civil War, Assyria, Babylon,
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.340]   captivity, destruction of the temple.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.340]   Do you guys, you guys can remember that?
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.340]   If I give you a little time, you might remember that, right?
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.340]   Okay, what's, okay, close your eyes,
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.340]   and just say it to yourself.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.340]   King, who is that?
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.340]   Okay, say it to yourself.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.340]   King.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.340]   And then split what year?
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:30.340]   Okay, A means B, C, D of Solomon's temple,
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:33.340]   destruction of Solomon's temple.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:38.340]   Now you have most of the Old Testament down,
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.340]   because after the destruction of the temple,
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.340]   there's 70 years of gap until you get to
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.340]   Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi,
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.340]   and you only have five books left.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.340]   Okay, king, king, split, A, B, C, D.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.340]   So one more time.
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:57.340]   First king, David, what year did he reign?
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.340]   1010.
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.340]   Second king, Solomon, what year did he reign?
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.340]   970.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:09.340]   40 years later, the Civil War happens at 930.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:12.340]   Couple hundred years later, who comes into power?
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.340]   Assyria.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:17.340]   Who knocks out Assyria and conquers even the south?
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.340]   Babylon.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.340]   What do they start doing with the people of Judah?
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:24.340]   Take them into captivity, and as they try to
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.340]   squish the rebellion, the temple of Solomon
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.340]   gets destroyed at 586.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.340]   Okay, and we will go more in depth of these things
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.340]   as each week progresses.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.340]   All right?
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.340]   First five books of the Bible.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.340]   Pentateuch, 12.
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.340]   History, five.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.340]   Poetry, five.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.340]   Major, 12.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:53.340]   Minor prophets, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:03:00.340]   Numbers, Deuteronomy.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.340]   Joshua, how many years?
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.340]   Judges, how many years?
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:12.340]   What are the five R's?
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.340]   Restoration.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.340]   Moses, tribes, judges, and then you end up with the kings.
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:22.340]   Who is the first king of Israel that was not God's choice?
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.340]   Saul, how many years did he reign?
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.340]   Then you have King, King split.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.340]   Who is the first king in that year?
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.340]   David, Solomon, split.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.340]   What year?
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.340]   930.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:39.340]   A, B, C, D.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.340]   And what's the next one without looking at your paper?
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:45.340]   Medo-Persians.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:50.340]   They release the people and then starts the returns home.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.340]   And you read about it in Isaiah, you read about it in Jeremiah,
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.340]   you'll read about it in Ezra.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:59.340]   The funny thing is, Ezra 1.1, Cyrus is the king of Persia,
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.340]   but it says in Ezra 5.14, Cyrus the king of Babylon.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.340]   You're like, what is going on?
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.340]   If you don't know these things, you're going to read it and you're
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.340]   like, this is a contradiction in the Bible.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.340]   No, but Medo-Persians, who did they knock out?
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:14.340]   Babylon.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.340]   Okay, C and D are not -- it's not an empire.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.340]   They knocked out Babylon.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:22.340]   So now Cyrus is king, not just of Persia, but he's also king of Babylon.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:25.340]   Ezra 1.1, Ezra 5.13, you see these things.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.340]   And now you'll know what's going on.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:35.340]   Oy.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.340]   Oh, that's good.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.340]   This is a good way to test you.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.340]   Okay.
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.340]   King-king split, A, B, C, D.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.340]   Medo-Persians return and Greeks.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.340]   One more time.
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.340]   King-king split, A, B, C, D.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.340]   Medo-Persians return and Greeks.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.340]   Last time.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.340]   King-king split, A, B, C, D.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:59.340]   Medo-Persians returns and Greeks.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:03.340]   Are the Greeks important in the scriptures?
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.340]   Not in the Old Testament.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.340]   They're not really mentioned in the Old Testament.
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:09.340]   When are they important?
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.340]   All over the New.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.340]   What's the New Testament written in?
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.340]   Greek.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:16.340]   And that's why I included them in there because on our sixth week that we
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.340]   studied together, we're going to study what happens in the 400 years between
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.340]   the Old and the New.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.340]   So that you'll know why is there no synagogue in the Old Testament but
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.340]   synagogues are all over the place in the New?
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.340]   Where did the Pharisees, Sadducees, Zealots, and the Essenes come from?
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.340]   Where did these guys?
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.340]   Right?
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.340]   Who is Herod?
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.340]   Where did he come from?
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:40.340]   Why is it, why is Caesar mentioned?
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.340]   Right?
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.340]   The barbarians and the Greeks, why are they mentioned?
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.340]   You have a different world altogether.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.340]   Okay?
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.340]   So we're going to cover that on our sixth week.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.340]   That's why the Greeks is important.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:56.340]   Now, do I have to do something?
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:06:05.340]   All right.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:10.340]   The 1010, 970, 930, you guys got that?
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.340]   No problem?
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:18.340]   722 is when Assyria conquers Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom.
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.340]   So now there's only one kingdom.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:23.340]   The North is gone.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:29.340]   612 is when Babylon knocks out Assyria.
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:36.340]   So then in 600s, Babylon starts to mess with Judah.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.340]   And they eventually take over.
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.340]   Zedekiah, the last king, rebels.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:45.340]   And Nebuchadnezzar, out of rage, destroys Solomon's temple and takes away all of
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.340]   the goods in the temple.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.340]   That's 586.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.340]   And these are historical dates.
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:54.340]   If you guys can this week just commit to memory these dates, that'll help you in
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.340]   the following weeks.
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.340]   Because everything else, I packaged it so you guys can remember without too much
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:00.340]   review.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.340]   Right?
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:07.340]   538 is when Medo-Persia, it's a united force.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:11.340]   It's actually brought up in the book of Daniel, okay, where you have Daniel
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:14.340]   seeing a vision of a bear that's crooked, okay?
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:18.340]   It's a crooked bear because the Persians are a lot stronger than the Medo's,
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.340]   than the Medianites, and they're like this.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.340]   But they together knock out Babylon.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:27.340]   So when you see Darius, that's a Median king.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.340]   Cyrus, Persian king.
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.340]   And we'll go over all these things.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:34.340]   But 538, the Medo-Persians knock out Babylon.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:38.340]   And then R1, R2, R3, we're going to cover in week five.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.340]   And 333 is the Greeks.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.340]   This works out easy too, right?
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:47.340]   How many of you guys think you can remember when the Greeks came into power
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.340]   with Alexander the Great?
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.340]   Anybody?
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.340]   Close your eyes.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.340]   What year?
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.340]   333.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:59.340]   So certain things in the Bible are easier to remember than others, okay?
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:04.340]   Now, the last thing we're going to cover before I teach you a song,
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.340]   I'm going to teach you a song.
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.340]   There are 20 kings of Judah.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.340]   How many?
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:17.340]   20, okay?
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.340]   The Book of Micah was written during the time of Joth and Ahaz and Hezekiah.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.340]   You're like, "Who are these guys?"
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.340]   Right?
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.340]   But Isaiah starts with Uzziah.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:30.340]   So you have all of these kings, and it would be beneficial for you to remember.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:33.340]   So we're going to take five at a time every week,
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:37.340]   and I'll make up a little catchy little cheer to help you remember the kings.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:41.340]   But we're going to start with 1, 6, 11, and 16.
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.340]   Because how many kings are there in Judah?
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:44.340]   20.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.340]   The north, don't worry about it.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:50.340]   The only king that really is of significance is Zimri,
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:54.340]   because he commits suicide, and Ahab.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.340]   You guys have heard of Ahab, right?
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.340]   Okay?
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.340]   He goes up against Elijah and Elisha.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.340]   Did you guys know Elijah and Elisha are never mentioned really,
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.340]   except maybe once or twice in the Chronicles?
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   Because they're in the north.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.340]   Remember I shared the kings and the Chronicles, there's overlap.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:10.340]   Kings is about everybody.
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.340]   What's Chronicles about?
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.340]   Just the south.
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.340]   That's why Elijah and Elisha are not really mentioned in the bottom.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.340]   Okay?
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:21.340]   So those are things I will continue to emphasize as we go.
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:28.340]   But 1, 6, 11, and 16, if we're taking them five at a time,
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:33.340]   are the first of the Judean kings you need to remember from each list.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.340]   Nod your head if that makes sense.
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.340]   Yeah?
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.340]   Okay.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:42.340]   Now, this is a chin, but I just needed a picture.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.340]   Okay?
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.340]   So this is not the real king.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.340]   This just stands for all the kings.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:51.340]   And we're going to remember 1, 6, 11, and 16.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.340]   Quick trivia fact.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:10:00.340]   Anybody know what Zeus, the god in Greek mythology, he had a mom.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.340]   Anybody know what her mom's name was, his mom's name?
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:06.340]   Huh?
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:09.340]   Rhea, R-E-A-H, Rhea.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:15.340]   Rhea is the mother to the god of gods in Greek mythology.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.340]   All right?
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:22.340]   So I'm going to introduce you to King Rhea Jojo.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.340]   Okay?
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:30.340]   This chin, his name is King Rhea Jojo.
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.340]   Okay?
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:41.340]   So I took the first two letters of each king in 1, 6, 11, and 16
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:46.340]   to help you organize it, because every week you're going to pick up five new ones.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.340]   And some of them are going to be familiar.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.340]   Some of them are not going to.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.340]   Jehoahaz was only in 609, and he died in 609.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.340]   So I was like, "What is that guy?"
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.340]   Okay?
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:01.340]   So Ahaziah reigned one year, and he died.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.340]   Okay?
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:17.340]   So Rhehoboam, R-E, Ahaziah, A-H, Jotham, 11, Josiah, 12.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:23.340]   Yes, O-E.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.340]   There's 20 kings in Judah.
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:30.340]   I'm going to give you five each week.
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:34.340]   So that you remember every week the first of those five.
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.340]   So kings 1 through 5, we're going to cover next week.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:40.340]   6 through 10, the following week.
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:42.340]   11 through 16, the week after that.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:46.340]   And then 16 to 20, the final week after that, so that you can kind of --
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.340]   because if you try to memorize all 20 at once, it's hard.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.340]   But if you could take them at five at a time, it's easier to remember.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:58.340]   But then in order for you to keep those five organized, we're going to do 1, 6, 11, 16.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.340]   Nod your heads if that makes sense.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.340]   Okay?
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:05.340]   It behooves you to memorize the 20 kings in order.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:09.340]   But there is a way to do that without screaming.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.340]   Okay?
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.340]   So even the dates if you can.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.340]   Okay?
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:18.340]   So Rheh-ha-jo-jo is what you need to remember.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:22.340]   Like Rheh-bo-am, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Jehosh -- Jehoash.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:28.340]   You'll remember all of these in order if you just stick with the program.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   Got it?
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.340]   Okay?
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:38.340]   So what's the mythical king of kings that we need to remember?
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.340]   King Rheh-jo-jo.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.340]   Can you remember their names?
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:53.340]   Rheh-bo-am, Ahaziah, Jo-tham, Jotham, and Josiah.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:59.340]   So next week we're going to start with Rheh-bo-am and his son Abijah who reigned two years.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:05.340]   And then in 9/11 came Asa and then Jehoshaphat was from 870 down.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.340]   And then you have Jehoram.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:10.340]   So that's how we're going to remember these things.
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.340]   Okay?
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:15.340]   And the way to keep it organized is king Rheh-ha-jo-jo.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:17.340]   Now you also learned who Zeus' mommy was.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.340]   Okay?
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:25.340]   So one more review with your friends.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.340]   Okay?
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.340]   And then we're going to wrap up with a song and a prayer.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.340]   Okay?
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.340]   Find a different friend if you can.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.340]   If you're too comfortable in your seat, then just go to the same friend.
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.340]   But go over these questions.
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:41.340]   And then in two minutes I'll give you a final song.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.340]   Okay?
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.340]   So here we go.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:59.340]   [ Music ]
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:28.340]   [ Inaudible ]
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:57.340]   [ Inaudible ]
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:26.340]   [ Inaudible ]
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.340]   >> One more minute.

[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:53.340]   >> All right.
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:58.340]   I trust that you guys are getting these things.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:08.340]   Timeline-wise now, you have basically the head, the neck, the spine, the hips, and the legs.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.340]   Okay?
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:13.340]   And we're going to fill in the different sections of the body as we go.
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:19.340]   So by the end of the sixth week, the intertestamental period between Malachi and Matthew, we're
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:24.340]   going to start to put a little bit of muscles on the skeleton.
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:27.340]   But you guys have just the head to the bottom.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.340]   Just straight through.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:29.340]   Okay?
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:32.340]   So review when you can.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:35.340]   Do you guys think this is going to take like 15 hours to review?
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.340]   No.
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.340]   It'll take you minutes.
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.340]   Okay?
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:43.340]   Some logistical things and then I'm going to teach you a song, part of a song, and then
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.340]   we're going to wrap up and go.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.340]   Every week we're going to open the doors at 10.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.340]   So at 10, the snacks are going to be ready.
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:54.340]   Okay?
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:57.340]   So we're going to need help coordinating the sacks.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:06.340]   So if Lindsey contacts you, I mean, it would help her self-esteem and she would be very
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:09.340]   encouraged if you guys were like, "Now!"
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.340]   Okay?
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.340]   If you guys are like, "Oh, sure.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.340]   Let me serve the body of Christ," because that is the appropriate response to the grace
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:16.340]   that he's shown us.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:21.340]   And let me -- so if she does happen to ask you or if you want to volunteer, talk to Lindsey.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.340]   I'm going to introduce Lindsey and Lawrence in a little bit.
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.340]   But there will be snacks starting at 10 a.m. every week.
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:29.340]   It's not breakfast.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.340]   It's going to be snacks.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:35.340]   So come early just to sit, review, get to know some people.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:40.340]   Because the more you review before we actually start, the easier things will be -- your brain
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:45.340]   is probably now a little bit more adhesive than it was an hour ago, two hours ago.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:50.340]   So that now if you read through the Bible, things are going to be a little bit more sticky.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:54.340]   My goal by the end of six weeks is to make it super adhesive.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.340]   So new stuff, it's just like -- right?
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:57.340]   Oh, that's Assyria.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.340]   Nineveh, capital of Assyria.
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:00.340]   Right?
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.340]   So that you will be able to do that.
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.340]   That's my goal.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:06.340]   My job is not to teach you.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.340]   My job is to cause you to want to learn.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.340]   You guys following me?
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:18.340]   If you ever disciple somebody, your job is not to instruct them of the Bible.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.340]   Your job is to help them love Christ more.
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:25.340]   To get them to self-feed and want God more.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.340]   Want his word more.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:30.340]   My goal is to have about -- there's 100 of you signed up.
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:36.340]   100 Old Testament faithful students who can make other faithful students.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:38.340]   Because we're going to keep having people come to the church.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.340]   And we can't do this every couple months.
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:42.340]   Okay?
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:47.340]   So learn as much as you can so that you can cause other people to want to learn as much as they can.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:48.340]   You guys following me?
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:51.340]   Fear is probably the biggest deterrent of the Old Testament.
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:54.340]   And boredom that comes from fear.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.340]   Okay?
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.340]   So don't be intimidated by the Old Testament.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.340]   Every week we'll go over a little bit.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:00.340]   10 a.m.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.340]   Doors are open.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.340]   Just come and review a little bit if you can.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:08.340]   We're going to have Lawrence and Lindsay, can you come up real quick?
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:09.340]   Like toward the front.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:15.340]   Just run up here real quick.
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:20.340]   So these are our TAs.
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:24.340]   Lindsay.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.340]   Lindsay, you're making Lawrence look like a weirdo.
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:27.340]   Come on up.
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.340]   Okay?
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:35.340]   So the reason they're here is because they've gone through the Old Testament study like this with me before.
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:45.340]   And so what we're going to have them do is if you miss a Saturday, okay, or if you feel like, oh, there's this part I didn't get.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.340]   They've gone through this so much.
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:55.340]   My voice is in their head so much that you can kind of review or refresh or get things you missed.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:21:07.340]   So 930 to about 10 every Saturday morning before we start, they will be available to you, I assume, maybe either like somewhere here or should we just make it here?
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.340]   Here.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.340]   We'll just have them hang out here.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:11.340]   So they'll come at 930.
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:16.340]   If you want like tutoring of the broad stuff, they will help you.
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:17.340]   Okay?
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:24.340]   Don't ask them like crazy stuff because the goal is just to have your brain more adhesive than it was before.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:25.340]   Okay?
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:28.340]   So they're going to be here every Saturday morning starting 930.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:33.340]   We're going to have snacks starting at 10 and then 1030 will start right away.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:34.340]   Okay?
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:35.340]   So that's their role.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.340]   So if they ask you for help, please just, you know, oblige.
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:41.340]   They're not going to ask you to like do their laundry and stuff.
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:44.340]   They're just going to ask for like, oh, can you help with this real quick?
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:47.340]   And the more people that are involved, the better.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:55.340]   And if you guys -- I mean, if we end up doing this class again, maybe you guys can serve in the same role and we can have more people who are familiar with these books.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.340]   Okay?
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.340]   So give them a hand in advance.
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.340]   [Applause]
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:08.340]   And for today, if you haven't paid your $10, this is not going into my pocket at all.
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.340]   Okay?
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:12.340]   This is going into our snacks.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.340]   Okay?
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:23.340]   And at the end, I think maybe if I feel like, you know, what would help if I could purchase something to give to all of you as a resource, something like that.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:27.340]   So whatever money is collected is only going to be used for this class.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.340]   So if you haven't already, we know who you are.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:31.340]   Okay?
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:35.340]   So avoid the embarrassment of me tracking you down because I already know who you are.
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.340]   I've high lit you.
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:37.340]   Okay?
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:44.340]   Go ahead and pay that via Venmo, check, PayPal, made out to Berean Community Church.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:48.340]   I think it would be good for us to have a recording.
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:52.340]   There's a lot of little gaps, as you guys can tell, where I'm having you guys rehearse stuff.
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.340]   But we will make them only available to you.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.340]   Okay?
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.340]   Don't share them.
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:00.340]   Just use them for yourself to review if need be.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:03.340]   I haven't figured out how we're going to get it out to you.
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:06.340]   But we did -- Lawrence, we did record today, right?
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.340]   We did record.
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.340]   So if you want to review, you can.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:16.340]   If you miss, that session will also be available to you so that you get the most out of the next six weeks.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.340]   Sounds like a plan?
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.340]   Okay.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.340]   Let's sing a song.
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:22.340]   You know all the words.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:23.340]   All right?
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.340]   Here we go.
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:31.340]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.340]   Stop.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.340]   So far so good?
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:34.340]   Okay.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:44.340]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and we're not going to go on.
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.340]   We're going to just stop there.
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:47.340]   All right?
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.340]   So some of you guys may have learned this as a kid.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.340]   Some of you guys are like, I don't know what's where.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.340]   So that's why we're going to go over this song every week.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:55.340]   So this song is also stuck in your head.
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:24:03.340]   Some of the parents for our children complain that the kids have been singing the books of the Bible all week and have been driving them crazy in a very sanctified, holy way.
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:04.340]   Okay?
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:10.340]   So you drive your neighbors crazy and your roommates crazy with God's word, at least the titles of the books of God's word.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.340]   Okay?
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.340]   Here we go.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:21.340]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth.
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.340]   That's it.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:23.340]   Okay?
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:24.340]   But we'll go over this a couple more times.
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:26.340]   Don't look at your table of contents.
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:30.340]   Try to hear my voice.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:32.340]   Be brainwashed.
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:33.340]   Okay?
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.340]   I don't know.
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:36.340]   We'll sing it again and again.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:43.340]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth.
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:50.340]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:56.340]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:02.340]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:09.340]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.340]   First and second, Samuel.
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:12.340]   Okay, we'll get there next week.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.340]   All right?
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.340]   Let's pray and then you guys can go.
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:21.340]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for giving us an opportunity to study about your word today.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:26.340]   We thank you for giving us just a lot of resources online.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.340]   We thank you for giving us books that have already organized a lot of this.
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:33.340]   And we thank you, Lord, for allowing us to participate in this together.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:41.340]   We pray for your help that we would be hungry, that we would be eager, not just to feed ourselves,
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:46.340]   but to share the good news of Jesus Christ through your inerrant word.
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:52.340]   All of it, all 66 books to our friends and family who need Christ.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.340]   Help us to love your word.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.340]   Help us to live your word.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.340]   Help us to share your word.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:59.340]   And we pray that as we go through the next six weeks,
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:05.340]   we will be equipped to be better stewards of your holy scriptures in Jesus' name we pray.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:06.340]   Amen.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.340]   Good job today, everybody.
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.340]   (audience applauding)
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.340]   What's your homework?
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:12.340]   You don't have any?
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:13.340]   Just review.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.340]   Okay?
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:18.140]   Okay, and then see you next Saturday at 10.30 sharp.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:27.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
