[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.180]   - Good morning church family, happy Lord's Day.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.980]   Let's continue to pray for our Indian mission team
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.380]   who left last Friday as a help to pastors in India
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.480]   in their gospel work.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.380]   This morning we begin with the song, Oh Great God,
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.580]   which I hope would be our earnest prayer to the Lord
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.680]   in light of the gospel we received.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.280]   And I'll read a shortened passage from Ephesians 2
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.780]   and it reads, and you were dead in the trespasses and sins
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.380]   in which you once walked, following the course of this world
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.680]   among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.940]   and were by nature children of wrath.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.140]   But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.580]   with which he loved us, even when we were dead
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.380]   in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.580]   By grace, you have been saved, amen.

[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:22.880]   - Well, good morning, church family.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.480]   I just have a couple of announcements for you.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.440]   As Isaac mentioned, our missions team is abroad.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.280]   I think they've arrived safely
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.720]   and they're gonna be in for a very busy week.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.080]   So please keep them in your prayers.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.480]   They'll be returning Saturday and joining us next week.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.040]   But this week looks to be extremely busy.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.620]   There's a lot of fruit to be born,
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.820]   a lot of labor on the part of our team.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.380]   So please join with them in praying for them.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.220]   If you are a member of the church,
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.880]   today is the last day for you
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.920]   to turn in your membership covenant.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.040]   I'm reading each one as it comes in
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.180]   and I know who you are, who haven't turned it in yet.
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.020]   Okay, and so this is a possible threat.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.020]   We may Asian shame you if we don't get it by today.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.920]   So please do turn that in, okay?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.080]   And also, if you are a brother at our church,
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.280]   we have a men's ministry workshop
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.820]   that's coming up February 17th.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.480]   Pastor Sung Kang from Foundation Mission Church,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.520]   he'll be joining us and he'll be walking us through
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.280]   just what it means to pursue holiness as a man of God.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.820]   And so that's February 17th
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.020]   and we do need you to register hopefully sooner than later
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.780]   so that we can account for the food.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.680]   Okay, so please take care of that.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.040]   Let me go ahead and pray for the offering.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.440]   There is a box in the back.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.520]   Otherwise, you can just give your offering to the Lord
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.680]   electronically on our various platforms.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.580]   Okay, let me pray.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.520]   Father, thank you for just allowing us to gather
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.240]   this morning in worship.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.580]   We are here to celebrate you
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580]   and I pray that you would be honored this morning.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.440]   And I pray, Father, also for your feeding
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.040]   and that our hearts would be reminded afresh
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.680]   of our purpose as Christians.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.340]   And as we bring our tithes and offerings to you,
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.720]   Lord, we acknowledge that every good thing that we have
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.120]   is from you.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.360]   And we're just saying thank you, God,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.480]   for just being so faithful and so kind to us.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.560]   Give us continued wisdom to steward
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.020]   all of our resources well.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.920]   And would you really protect and guide
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.360]   our time this morning together.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.480]   And Jesus, let me pray.

[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:49.340]   All right, if you guys have your Bibles,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.380]   go ahead and turn to Galatians chapter two,
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.240]   and I'm gonna be reading from verses 19 to 21.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.500]   Galatians chapter two, verses 19 to 21.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.060]   For through the law, I died to the law,
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.240]   so that I might live to God.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.020]   I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.100]   and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.980]   The life which I now live in the flesh,
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.420]   I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.980]   who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.720]   I do not nullify the grace of God,
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.740]   for if righteousness comes through the law,
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.820]   then Christ died needlessly.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.820]   Let's pray together.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:41.060]   Would you speak, Lord, and feed your people?
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.980]   And as we feed off of your word and your truth,
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.020]   grant us strength and power
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.960]   to persevere with joy and with compassion.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.740]   And would you grant us ears to hear
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.000]   hearts that are tender and receptive, God, to your truth?
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.540]   And help us this morning to see things
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.640]   as you would see them,
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.920]   and fill us with joy and passion as we feed.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.060]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:21.980]   So you're all familiar with the word metamorphosis.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.960]   It's one of the first five-syllable words
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.480]   that grade school children learn.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.320]   The process of metamorphosis in the animal kingdom
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.160]   is very common knowledge.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.560]   And through centuries, it has been observed
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.680]   that certain creatures in the animal kingdom
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.760]   go through a process of metamorphosis in their life cycles.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.800]   Metamorphosis is especially common in insects,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.360]   and they generally undergo two types of metamorphosis,
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.120]   incomplete and complete.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.360]   Grasshoppers, dragonflies, and cockroaches
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.560]   have what scientists call an incomplete
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.120]   or a partial metamorphosis,
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.080]   where the young just look like wingless miniature versions
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.280]   of the adults.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.240]   But insects like butterflies and moths
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.920]   undergo a complete metamorphosis,
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.680]   where the young not only look
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.480]   entirely different from the adults,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.160]   but they consume completely different foods
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.280]   and exhibit completely different behaviors.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.320]   There are four stages in the metamorphosis
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.820]   of butterflies and moths.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.440]   First, there's the egg stage,
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.720]   followed by the second stage,
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   where they call it the feeding stage,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.600]   where it's a caterpillar.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.480]   The third stage, they call the transition stage,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.560]   where the caterpillar becomes a pupa or a chrysalis,
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.680]   and it has a cocoon.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.360]   And the fourth and final stage is called by various names,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.160]   the adult, mature, or reproductive stage.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.240]   And we've all learned about this at some point.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.680]   The butterfly starts as an egg,
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.560]   eats voraciously as a caterpillar,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.440]   becomes a chrysalis, and then matures
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.120]   into a beautifully shaped winged creature.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.520]   And the life cycle of a butterfly is textbook stuff.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.560]   It's pretty standard.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.480]   So this is an observed, confirmed,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.000]   and factualized process that you and I are familiar with.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.020]   The metamorphosis is in the very DNA of every butterfly.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.140]   So the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.120]   is an expected outcome.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.920]   We would all be shocked if out of the chrysalis
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.120]   comes just a fatter version of the caterpillar.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.440]   It is a mysterious and beautiful process,
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.800]   even though it's something we have come to expect.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.920]   The transformation is radical, it is unalterable.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.440]   And metamorphosis, by definition,
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.000]   is a change of the form or nature of a creature
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.600]   into a completely different one.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.880]   The Bible teaches us that when a person
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.600]   who has once been spiritually dead believes upon Christ,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.800]   there is a spiritual metamorphosis.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   And the Christian metamorphosis, too,
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.440]   can be spiritually observed and confirmed.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.480]   The complete transformation of the Christian, likewise,
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.000]   is miraculous, mysterious, and radical.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   This, too, is unalterable, this, too, is irreversible.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.040]   And this transformation, in the same way, is also textbook.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.960]   The metamorphosis of a Christian
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.680]   is spelled out explicitly in the Bible.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.260]   "he is a new creature.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.880]   "The old things passed away,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.480]   "and behold, new things have come."
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.720]   Among insects, the metamorphosis can be incomplete,
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   where the young simply looks like wingless,
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.160]   tiny versions of the adults.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.320]   But in Christians, the metamorphosis,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.480]   the radical transformation, is always complete.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:16.400]   It is always total, it is always all-encompassing.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.880]   The old things are gone, the new things have come,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.120]   hearts of stone have been completely replaced
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   with tender hearts of flesh,
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.720]   the satanic has been replaced by the godly,
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.080]   and those who once were spiritual corpses
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.480]   change and become living vessels
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.480]   filled with the very Spirit of God,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.840]   and who walk in newness of life.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:48.600]   So a Christian, by definition, is a new creation,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.400]   radically, totally, and irreversibly changed.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.160]   There's no such thing as a partial Christian salvation.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.940]   And again, this is textbook stuff.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.880]   The old has gone, the new has come,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.440]   and the Christian's legal standing
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.200]   before the judgment of God has been instantaneously changed,
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.460]   and that's what we call justification.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:18.320]   And though the outward, perceivable change
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.240]   may not be immediately noticeable,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.320]   the very DNA of the Christian is also completely
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.160]   and instantaneously changed upon belief,
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.540]   and that's what we call regeneration.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.960]   And it's only a matter of time
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.200]   that the DNA starts to produce its results.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.000]   So the passage that I read for you in the beginning,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.280]   Galatians chapter two, 19 to 21,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.800]   is our main text for this morning.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.040]   It's a very well-known and well-memorized passage.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.120]   It's a passage we all inductively
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.560]   studied together back in November,
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.920]   and we're gonna reflect on this today,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.160]   and hopefully, it whets our appetites
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.920]   for part two of Galatians,
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.480]   which will begin in about a week and a half.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.560]   So let's take a moment to read the three verses again.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.240]   Galatians two, 19 to 21.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.640]   For through the law, I die to the law,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.200]   so that I might live to God.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.480]   I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.960]   and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   In the life which I now live in the flesh,
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.720]   I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.080]   who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.220]   I do not nullify the grace of God,
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.520]   for if righteousness comes through the law,
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.340]   then Christ died needlessly.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.160]   So in these three verses,
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.040]   the Apostle Paul gives us a snapshot
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.320]   of the stages of the Christian's metamorphosis,
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.520]   and we're gonna look at that snapshot today,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.480]   and here's the outline and thought flow up front, okay?
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.180]   I'm gonna walk you through these three verses
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.980]   to explain first why we have been transformed,
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.840]   so the purpose of our transformation.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.160]   There is a reason for your transformation,
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.600]   and then I'll be describing the means
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.380]   and the process involved in this transformation,
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:17.240]   and to close, I'll be launching off of verse 21
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.760]   and the overall context of Galatians,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.080]   and detailing for you what is inferred
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.420]   of the end result or the end product of our transformation.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.760]   Okay, so first point, the purpose of our transformation,
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.920]   chapter two, verse 19.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.440]   Second, the process of the transformation, verses 20 and 21.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.000]   The third point, the product of our transformation.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.880]   So let's look at Galatians 2, 19 again,
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.480]   and it reads, for through the law,
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.200]   I died to the law so that I might live to God.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.900]   So before we look at the purpose
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.980]   behind God's transformation of a person,
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.560]   we need to take a moment to examine
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.180]   why God had created man to begin with.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.920]   So through even a cursory reading of the scriptures,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.600]   we can easily conclude that you and I
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.480]   have been created by God and for God
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.180]   to love God and to serve God.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.200]   God does not exist for man's happiness or fulfillment.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.680]   Man exists for God and not the other way around.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.960]   Man was created by God and for God's glory,
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.080]   and this God, our creator, is set apart.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   He is holy, and to give holy service to God
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.760]   was the original purpose for which
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.480]   all things have been created.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.680]   And all things in this creation
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.040]   were deemed initially very good.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.020]   But we also see through the scriptures
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:53.020]   that sin entered the world and caused every human
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:57.040]   born after the fall to rebel against that purpose
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.320]   and to commit what R.C. Sproul calls cosmic treason.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.500]   The fallen and natural man,
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.580]   in his fallen and natural condition,
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.580]   is born with a delusional and twisted sense of entitlement.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:18.360]   He is born innately thinking that God the creator,
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   if in fact he does exist, exists to serve him
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.720]   and to bless him.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.960]   The scripture describes fallen and natural man
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.520]   as simply an unreasoning creature of instinct
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.980]   who is blind to the sins that separate him from God.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.320]   He's a fool.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.240]   He is a lover of the temporal.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.160]   He is a lover of pleasure.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.260]   He is worldly.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.400]   He is self-exalting and self-centered.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.360]   And he is completely oblivious
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.600]   to the purpose for which he has been created.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.380]   Fallen natural man.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.040]   The Christian, on the other hand,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.200]   is one who has had his eyes open
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.120]   to the truth of his rebellion,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.960]   his utter depravity,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.920]   and to his inability to draw near by himself to holy God.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.360]   In the beginning of Galatians 2.19 reads,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.400]   "For through the law, I died to the law."
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.320]   And we see through the context of Galatians
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.160]   that this simply means that
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.420]   the Christian has rejected the notion
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.360]   that he can satisfy the requirements
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.600]   of God's holy law in and of himself.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.700]   The Christian is one who, by grace,
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.840]   has come to the realization
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.000]   that he cannot be reconciled to God by his own strength
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.940]   or by his own effort.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.920]   The Christian is one who has come to understand
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.240]   that the law, or moral living, or upright living,
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.040]   cannot save him and that the holy law of God
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.040]   serves only to condemn him.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.440]   And the Christian is saved by grace alone,
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.720]   through faith alone, by the sacrifice of Christ alone.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   And in that moment of belief, he is instantly transformed.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.640]   And the transformed Christian
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.460]   is one who understands that his primary purpose
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.360]   in his being saved and transformed
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.780]   is that he might now be restored to that original purpose.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.240]   He has been created by God and for God
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.880]   to love God and to serve God, and now he can,
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.140]   and now he must fulfill that purpose.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:44.220]   So the Christian has a zeal for this purpose,
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.180]   and the purpose, or the fulfillment of this purpose,
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.060]   is wired into the very DNA of the Christian.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.440]   He lives to God with a passion and fervor,
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.440]   not in order to be saved, but because he is saved, amen?
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:07.680]   For through the law, I die to the law, hinnah,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.560]   so that I might live to God.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.800]   Now, we've covered this before,
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.400]   but the Greek word hinnah is a very important word
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.120]   in the scriptures.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.560]   It's a conjunction word translated
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.880]   as in order that or so that,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.060]   and it always denotes the reason or purpose of something.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.920]   The word hinnah, or so that,
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.880]   always describes the desired outcome
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.760]   or expectation to what has previously been set.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.560]   So there's a purpose to a Christian's change
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.320]   in standing and in nature.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.120]   For through the law, I die to the law, why?
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.720]   Hinnah, that I might live to God.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.860]   And it's important to pause here and to think deeply
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.940]   and honestly about a few questions.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.800]   Does your life more closely resemble
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.560]   that of the self-centered, self-exalting,
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.460]   worldly and fallen man,
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.480]   or more that of the man who now understands
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.860]   the purpose for which he has been created
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.680]   and the purpose for which he has been saved?
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.400]   Remember, the old is gone, the new has come.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.420]   So if you have indeed experienced
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.840]   that instantaneous transformation,
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   if you have indeed become a new creation,
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.460]   what is the purpose of your job or career now?
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:39.640]   Is it still to fulfill and satisfy you,
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.980]   make you financially comfortable?
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.660]   Does your job exist to make you shine,
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.340]   to make you thrive?
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.040]   Or have you been placed in your job
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.640]   to proclaim the excellencies of Christ
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.400]   in the dark corners in and at your job?
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:05.600]   What is now the primary purpose of your role as a spouse
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.440]   or a parent or a son or daughter?
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.980]   Do the people around you exist to please you?
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.760]   Or do you exist in their life
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.660]   to lead them to the glory of Christ?
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:26.660]   What is the purpose of why you even eat or drink?
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.320]   Is it simply to be merry since tomorrow you die?
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.720]   Or is the purpose of even the most mundane things
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.800]   in your life for the glory of God?
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.200]   What is the purpose of your presence in this church?
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.700]   Is it to bless you or is it to build his kingdom?
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:53.280]   Is the knowledge of Jesus Christ your life's pursuit
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.760]   and your life's goal?
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.920]   Or is that knowledge only the means
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.760]   to somehow unlocking God's special blessings?
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.360]   We are not saved to simply escape hell.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.200]   Amen?
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.060]   Amen?
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:16.420]   We were not saved so that we can simply be more moral,
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.660]   that we can make the world a better place,
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.500]   that we can access God's favor and protection in this life,
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.280]   or so that we can have an eternal insurance policy of sorts.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:33.040]   The primary purpose of our lives, our very creation,
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   our redemption, and our transformation
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.480]   is henna so that we might live to God.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.540]   We are not our own.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.420]   We were bought at a price, it says in 1 Corinthians 6.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.420]   Therefore, we are to honor God with our lives.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.900]   That is the primary purpose of our transformation.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.900]   Again, that we might live to God and live fully to God.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.840]   And as the Westminster Catechism states,
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.560]   the chief end of man is to glorify God
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.560]   and to enjoy him forever.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.120]   And that forever has already started for the Christian.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:16.440]   So what does this tangibly mean then for the here and now
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.480]   while we are kind of in this limbo stage?
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.920]   We're kind of in this, not cornucopia,
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.760]   cocoon chrysalis stage, right?
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.360]   Waiting the final product.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.560]   I'm gonna read Galatians 2, 28 to 21 for you,
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.240]   and this will bring us to our second point.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.560]   The process of the transformation.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.700]   I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:39.120]   and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.920]   The life which I now live in the flesh,
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.760]   I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.960]   who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.240]   I do not nullify the grace of God.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.440]   And we're gonna read the rest in the third point,
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.660]   so be patient, okay?
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.620]   By the grace of God, we have seen our desperate need
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.960]   for a Savior, we have cleaved ourselves to Christ
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.760]   by believing upon his name, Acts 4, 12.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.040]   And because of belief, we're in right standing before God.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.200]   And this is the beginning point
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.720]   of the transformation process,
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.560]   and that's called justification.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.760]   And as we know from Romans 8, 30,
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.560]   that those who have been justified will one day,
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.360]   guarantee, will one day be glorified.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.460]   And this glorification is the final part
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.700]   of the Christian life cycle.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:36.140]   So broadly put, from where we are conscious
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.500]   of all the changes, our transformation begins
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.160]   at justification, and it will end with glorification.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.180]   Glorification is what awaits us in the resurrection
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.740]   and what awaits us in eternity.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.900]   The beginning of the Christian life cycle
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.780]   is justification, and the end is glorification.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.320]   This is textbook.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.860]   It is mysterious, it is radical,
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.900]   but at the present, you and I who put our faith in Christ
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.180]   are in this cocoon-like middle stage,
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.080]   waiting for that final transformation.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:17.960]   And it's an awkward, already but not yet stage.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.140]   It's like an engagement period between a man and a woman.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.240]   You're kind of one, but you're not.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.220]   You're spoken for and you're taken for,
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.980]   there's a ring on your finger, but you're not one.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:41.140]   So in this in-between stage,
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.380]   even though it serves an important purpose, right?
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.940]   The invites need to go out, there are other sheep
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.860]   who are not yet of the fold.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.540]   Even though it's an important purpose,
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.860]   it's very much an awkward and confusing one.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:58.160]   It's often a very painful one.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.220]   And on occasion, we may be left wondering
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.340]   if we indeed have been changed at all.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:10.380]   Many years ago, I had heard that most lizards,
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.740]   a lot of animal talk today, okay?
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.860]   Most lizards can self-amputate their tails
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.900]   to distract predators and to escape.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.420]   Not just if you already knew this, okay?
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.760]   So I remembered that.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.140]   So when I went camping as a young teen,
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.140]   the first morning of our camping trip,
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:37.140]   I saw a lizard basking in the sun, chilling on a rock.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.100]   And only in the interest of science,
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.060]   not because I was cruel or naughty,
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.660]   just in the interest of science,
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.020]   I went up to the lizard, and I kicked it.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:55.700]   To see, wait, don't judge me. (audience laughing)
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.720]   To see whether or not, for myself,
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.180]   if that tail would snap off.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.020]   And it did.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:07.540]   And this three-inch, severed piece of tail
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.760]   thrashed and flailed for several minutes.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.500]   Moments before, when the lizard
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.080]   had just been resting in the sun,
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.960]   there was no movement in the tail.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.640]   But interestingly enough,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.800]   once the tail had detached from the body,
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.240]   it took on a life of its own, literally.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.140]   That tail was dead.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.660]   It was cut off from its source of life,
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.160]   but it was still dying.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.720]   It was both dead and still dying.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.500]   And sometimes, similarly,
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.820]   we who have been transformed completely
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.320]   still feel like that that transformation is incomplete.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.660]   We are one with Christ,
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.580]   but sometimes we still feel so distant from Christ.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:01.940]   We have been permanently and irreversibly changed,
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.220]   but the residue of our old self,
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.300]   it's still stubbornly very present.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:13.840]   Why do we struggle so much to remember our purpose?
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.920]   To live lives that are consistent to our transformed nature?
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.560]   Well, it's because sin, though it is dead in us,
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.260]   it is still dying in us.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.700]   It's both an already and not yet.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:33.660]   We have been changed, but we are still being changed.
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.780]   We've been transformed,
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.600]   but God is still transforming us
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.640]   and conforming us to the image of his Son.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.700]   We have been united with Christ in his death,
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.900]   but we are still being united with Christ in his death.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.980]   And this process, which we call sanctification,
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.260]   is currently the stage in which we find ourselves.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.200]   Justification, glorification,
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.480]   in the middle, we're being sanctified.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.340]   We have been crucified with Christ,
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.820]   but we are still living life in the flesh.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.340]   So this life we are living in the flesh,
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.120]   while we are awaiting glory,
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.040]   we live by faith in the Son of God
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.780]   who loved us and gave himself for us.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.180]   We have been crucified with Christ,
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.180]   and we are still, figuratively speaking, hanging there.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:33.580]   And we are persevering in our hanging by faith.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.500]   I wanna point our attention to the first few words
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.140]   in this very well-memorized passage of the Bible.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:45.380]   I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:51.540]   The verb, susterao, okay, I have been crucified.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.280]   It's very significant for two reasons here.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.640]   It is in the present perfect tense,
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.460]   and it is a passive verb.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:07.500]   The present perfect tense is used for past actions
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.560]   that are related to or continue on into the present.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.400]   So we are still crucified with Christ.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.900]   It is ongoing.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:24.740]   Secondly, it's in the passive.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:30.460]   This is something that was done to us,
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.860]   and it's continuing to be done to us.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.480]   And just as no one can physically crucify himself,
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.980]   I don't think that's possible.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:44.340]   Neither can we spiritually crucify ourselves with Christ.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:49.740]   Our past and ongoing crucifixion, our sanctification,
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:54.700]   was initiated by God, and it is ongoing
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.740]   because it is God's will for our earthly lives.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.620]   Our sanctification is God's will.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:07.100]   It is part of his good and pleasing and perfect will.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.580]   Do you agree with that?
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.400]   First Thessalonians 4.3.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.800]   You better agree with that 'cause it's in the Bible, okay?
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   For this is the will of God, your sanctification.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:28.720]   Secondly, it's a prerequisite to seeing God face-to-face.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:33.960]   In Hebrews 12, after the writer says
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.600]   that God disciplines the Christian
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.060]   in the way that a loving father would discipline his child,
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.440]   he talks about the need for sanctification to be embraced
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.920]   and almost pursued by the beloved child of God.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.240]   Hebrews 12.14.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   Pursue peace with all men and the sanctification
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.200]   without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.360]   Our sanctification is God's will.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.340]   Our sanctification is a prerequisite to seeing the Lord,
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.200]   and it's also the very purpose
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.720]   for Jesus' sacrifice of himself.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:16.160]   For by one offering, Hebrews 10.14,
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:21.160]   he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:28.000]   Justification, glorification, sanctification.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.120]   So this life we are living in the flesh is a crucified life,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.620]   and it will continue to be a crucified life.
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.560]   Here's a question.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.620]   When does a crucified man get off the cross?
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:48.360]   You have an answer in your head?
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.980]   When does a crucified man get off the cross?
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:58.480]   Only after he's completely dead, right?
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.280]   The phrase dead man walking has been traditionally used
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.320]   to describe a condemned prisoner
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.080]   being walked to his place of execution.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.200]   Figuratively, we are not just dead men walking
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.600]   who walk by faith and not by sight.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.140]   We're not just dead men walking.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.800]   We are dead men hanging,
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.520]   eagerly waiting for this crucifixion
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.300]   to come to its merciful end.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.920]   Now imagine for a moment with me
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.120]   what it would be like to be crucified.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.840]   (hands tapping)
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.480]   Is it comfortable?
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.120]   Ooh, that's nice.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.260]   Is it comfortable?
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:44.600]   Is there a way to somehow position or adjust your body
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   to make it less uncomfortable and perhaps more tolerable?
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:56.680]   With each passing hour hanging there,
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.160]   stripped, naked, and bloodied,
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.200]   do you think that you just get used to it?
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.960]   Or do you think you would feel the pain
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.880]   with greater intensity
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.840]   as you try to keep your lungs from collapsing
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.800]   by pushing against those nails?
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.200]   And in that crucified moment,
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.840]   how many of us would not just prefer it
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.300]   all to just end quickly?
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.760]   Wouldn't death be better by far?
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.580]   Would not death be gain?
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:40.800]   The ongoing crucifixion of the old self.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.980]   This is the Christian's primary proclamation.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.880]   This is the Christian's boast.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:54.280]   This is actually the Christian's only boast,
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.020]   and that, too, is textbook.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.620]   It's in the book.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.620]   Galatians 6, 14.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.000]   "But may it never be that I would boast
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   "except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.760]   "through which the world has been crucified to me
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.040]   "and I to the world.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.240]   "But may it never be that I would boast
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.780]   "except and only and solely in
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.680]   "the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   It's a very strange thing
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:33.120]   for a Christian to find this cursed world
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:37.140]   to be a very, very comfortable place.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:44.520]   It's a very strange thing for any Christian
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.760]   whose boast is that,
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.360]   to find this cursed world
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:54.360]   to be a very, very comfortable place.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.700]   It's a frightening thing
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.380]   for a Christian to be in love
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.880]   with the things in this world.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:06.580]   Here's a mini litmus test.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.140]   If we were to think of the Christian life as a ship,
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:14.340]   what kind of ship would this life be
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.400]   in your mind and in your future?
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.040]   Christian life is a ship.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.280]   What do I see in the pathway of this ship?
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:31.080]   Is it a luxury cruise ship
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.960]   where Christ has purchased a first class seat for you?
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.580]   Or is it more of a battleship
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:44.100]   or a lifeboat on which Christ is in the captain's seat
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:49.100]   and wants to use the boat to save drowning sailors?
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:54.800]   This is something very sobering for us to think about
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.640]   while we crucified Christians live in Orange County.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.820]   1 John 2:15, "Do not love the world
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.240]   "nor the things in the world.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.480]   "If anyone loves the world,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.300]   "the love of the Father is not in him."
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:15.300]   Do not love the world nor the things in the world.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.140]   If anyone loves the world,
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.400]   the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.860]   If anyone loves the world,
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.300]   the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:29.140]   Wiggle around that.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.400]   You cannot.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:37.220]   The observable evidence of your metamorphosis
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:42.160]   cannot but be a growing dissatisfaction
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.780]   with the things of this world.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.500]   I believe that love, joy, and peace
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.840]   increases in the Christian life with each passing year,
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.580]   but I also believe that the pain and the discomfort
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.040]   in this crucified Christian life
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.360]   also intensifies with each passing year.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.660]   And if somehow in your mind right now
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.540]   you're trying to push against this statement I just made,
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.180]   or if you disagree, make sure both your push
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.280]   and your disagreement are rooted in the Scriptures.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.500]   Otherwise, your faith is not based on the Bible.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.060]   It's based on wishful thinking.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:23.220]   The initial moment of crucifixion,
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:28.060]   when the giant nails penetrate the bones
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:33.060]   onto the wooden beams, I would imagine to be very painful.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:38.600]   But the process of hanging there
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   with the entire weight of my 200-pound body,
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.480]   it was 220 last year, all right, 200-pound body,
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   being held up by my torn flesh and my broken bones,
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.300]   I imagine it to be even more excruciating pain.
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:02.460]   The hanging part is more painful than the nailing part.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:07.980]   In the ancient world, a spear to the side
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:13.660]   of the crucified man was considered an act of kindness.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:19.320]   It was considered mercy because the process
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.980]   of slowly dying on a cross was pure agony
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.420]   and the spear would end it.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:29.860]   Oftentimes when a person is saved,
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.460]   many of the surface-level sins get immediately purged
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.300]   out of the person's life.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.420]   It's a miracle, right?
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:40.260]   God changes the heart and lots of stuff get flushed out.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:43.780]   A lot of immediate changes take place in the lives
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.580]   and in the hearts of new believers.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.540]   But believe it or not,
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:56.260]   our rebellion ran extremely deep.
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.820]   It's deep inside the core so that the residual effects
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.880]   of this rebellion takes a long time to bleed out.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.060]   So the initial shocks of the nails can be painful,
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.820]   but the agony of the ongoing bleeding out
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:17.820]   of our sins is likely even more shocking and more painful.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:22.040]   God hates all sins.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:25.380]   But you know where we're at the top of his list?
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.100]   It's not pornography.
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.700]   It's not embezzlement.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.940]   It's not even murder.
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:34.280]   Proverbs 8:13 gives us a little bit of a glimpse
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.940]   into what God hates the most.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.540]   The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:44.540]   Pride and arrogance and the evil way
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.340]   and the perverted mouth I hate.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:53.300]   More than drunkenness, more than sexual sins,
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:58.300]   more than theft, God abhors pride.
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.420]   And if you are his child,
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:07.500]   he's gonna wipe pride out of your life.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:15.460]   He is out to destroy and flesh out
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.620]   all the residual rebellion from your life.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   He is gonna put 'em all to death.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:28.180]   Are there things currently that are happening
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:33.180]   in your life to expose and rid you of your self-reliance,
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:39.500]   your insecurities, your arrogance,
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:46.020]   your pattern of deception, your self-sufficiency,
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.380]   your boasting of what you have
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:54.380]   and what you do, your self-exalting ways,
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.240]   your desire for attention, your desire for approval,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.980]   your desire to be celebrated by those around you?
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:07.660]   Perhaps the Lord in his love is putting those things
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:11.660]   to death and he is letting you bleed out
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:15.080]   because he loves you,
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.140]   because he is weaning you off of this world.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:24.100]   He is emptying you of everything that needs to be emptied
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:27.220]   in order to fill every part of you
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.900]   with the righteousness of Christ.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:35.780]   So take a moment when you pray,
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.160]   "God, why are you doing this to me?"
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.660]   Do you really want him to answer?
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.720]   'Cause you're arrogant!
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.380]   You're self-exalting!
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.760]   You love the created things more than the creator
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.400]   who is to be forever praised.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.760]   It is evidence of his love.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.320]   And the Christian recognizes that,
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.560]   as painful as it is, and he perseveres.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.800]   I'm gonna keep the last point brief.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.280]   What is the final product of this metamorphosis?
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   Verse 21 of Galatians 2,
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.240]   "I do not nullify the grace of God,
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.820]   "for if righteousness comes through the law,
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.700]   "then Christ died needlessly."
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:26.240]   The end product of the transformation of the Christian
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.400]   is perfect and eternal righteousness.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.560]   The perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.520]   is what we will be clothed with.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.560]   What we are clothed with,
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.460]   but we will be clothed with completely.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.500]   Psalm 117 gives us a little preview, then, of what awaits.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:52.440]   For the Lord is righteous, he loves righteousness,
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.520]   and the upright will behold his face.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.960]   I've shared with you that at the end
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.000]   of the Christian metamorphosis is glory,
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.780]   and what awaits in our glorification,
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:09.300]   no man at present can accurately describe in words.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:12.660]   'Cause the Bible doesn't even describe it.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.900]   Fully in words.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:19.540]   But what awaits us, the Bible does say,
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:24.540]   "No eye has seen it, no ear has heard it,
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:29.220]   "no mind, however brilliant,
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:32.740]   "has ever conceived of all the glorious things
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.040]   "which the Lord has prepared for those who love him,
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.280]   "through those whom he will glorify."
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.360]   It is beyond our imagination.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.260]   No matter how vivid our imagination can be.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:55.180]   You and I will be co-heirs with Christ,
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:59.020]   and we have been and will be seated
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:01.580]   in the heavenly places with Christ.
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.240]   Strange.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:09.100]   Textbook.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:13.300]   There's not gonna be too much by way of application
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.580]   in this sermon, partly because there are
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.900]   no direct applications that come from the passage.
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.140]   Actually, Galatians, it's an epistle
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.580]   that is mostly all description.
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.020]   The first command doesn't show up until chapter five.
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.020]   Actually, chapter four, verse 21 has a command,
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.300]   but Paul says, "Tell me something,"
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:28.300]   so it's just rhetorical, okay?
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.740]   So there's no application that Paul gives
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.140]   until way later in the book of Galatians.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:38.180]   But by way of application, I'm gonna leave you
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:42.180]   with a hope-filled passage detailing what awaits us.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:46.480]   So hopefully, while you're hanging on for dear death,
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.460]   that this helps you to persevere.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:53.260]   First John three, two to three, "Beloved,
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.240]   "now we are children of God,
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.840]   "and it has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:06.960]   "We know that when he appears, we will be like him,
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:10.860]   "because we will see him just as he is.
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:16.340]   "And everyone who has this hope fixed on him
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.600]   "purifies himself just as he is pure."
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.660]   Amen.
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:27.740]   The only application is hang on
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:33.660]   and enjoy it, I guess, as much as you can.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.820]   But you know what's cool about being crucified?
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:42.420]   You can't crucify yourself, nor can you take yourself off.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:46.880]   But if God has placed you there with Christ,
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:53.360]   you can't get off it, and you will be glorified.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:57.360]   He has sealed that with a promise.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.680]   The life that you now live in the flesh,
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.280]   you live by faith in the Son of God
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.420]   who loved you and gave himself up for you,
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:09.580]   if indeed your heart has been transformed,
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:13.200]   if indeed the old is gone and the new has come.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:17.920]   If you're going through a season
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.160]   where you're being especially sanctified
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:25.380]   and you're especially feeling the pain of sanctification,
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.320]   walk by faith, live by faith,
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.920]   because he loved you, he loves you,
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.240]   and he gave himself up so that you would have life
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.400]   and life to the full.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:43.600]   Amen?
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.600]   Let's pray together.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.880]   Father, we ask that you would help us
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:51.600]   to remember
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:57.040]   that the heavens and the earth will pass away,
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.840]   but your words are eternal, they will never pass away.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:06.680]   And in your word, we are told of our horrible past,
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:17.760]   we're told of our future, and we trust it.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.600]   We trust you, we trust your word,
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.120]   and help us to live faithfully and persevere
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.140]   in the truths of your word.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:30.340]   Empower us, strengthen and enable us,
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.260]   and encourage those of us who are feeling very feeble.
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.500]   Pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:42.400]   - If we could all rise for our closing praise.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.780]   (gentle music)
