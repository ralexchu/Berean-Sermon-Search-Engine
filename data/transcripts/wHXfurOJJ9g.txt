[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Testing, testing.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Okay.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Testing.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   One, two, three, four.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Five, six.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   All right.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Hopefully you guys have had a very good discussion.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I was having a lengthy discussion with Pastor Peter earlier today.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And we're kind of in the middle of a discussion about how to do
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   this.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And we're kind of talking about how, like, for the both of us,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   in this passage, there's a lot that we have to take out of the
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   presentation because there's a lot in here.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Okay.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   So most likely I'm not going to be getting to every question that
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   came up and everything that even I deem important.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I'm just going to share with you some things that I feel like would
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   be helpful a little bit to kind of tie everything together.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And the goal of inductive study is not to get every answer.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   The goal of inductive study really is to dive deeply and to start
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   digging to see really how God would have us live.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Right.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   So the first thing, and you've seen this before, this is just a
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   list of descriptions that in the beginning everything was highlit
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   in purple.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Okay.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   From last week, you know, there are empty talkers, receivers,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   circumcision, upsetting whole families, teaching for sordid gain,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And then today Jewish myths turn away from the truth, defiled,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   unbelieving, defiled, there's a proper profession, an improper
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   practice, detestable, disobedient, worthless for any good deed.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Detestable in some translations is actually abomination,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   abominable.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   All right.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   So, man, these people are abominable is what it's saying, like
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   damnable.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Right.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So this is the description of the rebellious men.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And what is Titus commanded to do?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Rebuke, reprove.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   How?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Severely.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Right.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So we're going to be looking at this.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So here in verse 13 it says, "This testimony is true and for
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   this reason, reprove."
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Okay.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And you guys might have had many colorful discussions about this
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   already, but I'm just going to look at a parallel passage in
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   1 Timothy 1 and 2 Timothy 2 and kind of see the heartbeat behind
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   why we reprove.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   All right.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   1 Timothy 1, 3 to 7 reads, "As I urged you upon my departure from
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   men not to teach strange doctrines."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Okay, there's a similar theme.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   "Nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies which give
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   of God which is by faith.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   good conscience and a sincere faith.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the law even
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   though they do not understand either what they are saying or
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   the matters about which they make confident assertions."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So we are surrounded by religious people who think they
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   know a lot of stuff.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And the call, whether it's the church or the individual
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Christian, okay, I haven't gotten there yet, but it's to
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   reprove.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But the goal is what?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Love.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But when we're usually out to reprove somebody, ooh, love is
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   a little harder, right?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   We want to be vindictive.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   We want to win an argument.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Some of you guys I know in here, you don't care about the truth
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   as much as you care about winning, okay?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   That's not the attitude that's supposed to be surfacing.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   2 Timothy 2, 23 to 26, "But refuse foolish and ignorant
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   speculations knowing that they produce quarrels.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   The Lord's bondservant must not be quarrelsome but be
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   gentleness correcting those who are in opposition.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   If perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   escape from the snare of the devil having been held captive
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   to him to do his will."
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So here, just, this is a parallel passage, okay?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   What we're being called to do really is with Christlike love
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and compassion, correct.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Even if they are enemies of the church, the goal is not like
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   judgment and vindication.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   The goal it is really to love.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And the scriptures point out, seems like there's a possibility
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   that they can be brought over and won over, okay?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So I think modern day Christians, when it comes to like
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   false prophets and health and wealth gospel teachers and
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   stuff, we want God to just judge them and condemn them.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   But the goal is not that.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's always to bring them to restoration as well, okay?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Is that likely?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Usually not, okay?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But that's the heartbeat of the Christian.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And that's why for elders and leaders in the church, you can't
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   be chip on your shoulder, vindictive, pugnacious.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It takes a mature man to be able to get yelled at and spit on
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   and chewed on and being called dumb and ignorant and bigoted
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and just to continue to speak in love, right?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So that's why the list of elders or the qualifications of elders
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   remains very important.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Here it says, "But rebuke them sharply."
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And when I see this, like instinctively I think emotion,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   right?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   If I rebuked my child sharply, you're thinking that there's
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   yelling and screaming, right?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Or like a stick.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Like, "Rawr, rawr, rawr."
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Like, is that what Paul is saying?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Like, just do one of these, like shaking them and like,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   "Snap out of it."
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Is that what that is?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And something that I found was the word severely is only used
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   two places in the entire New Testament.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And so I kind of did a little bit of a just exploration into
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   this.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And it's also used in 2 Corinthians 13.10.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And this is what Paul says.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And this is the other place where he uses severely, okay?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   "For this reason I am writing these things while absent so that
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   when present I need not use severity in accordance with the
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   authority with which the Lord gave me for building up and not
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   for tearing down."
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I don't think this is an emotional word.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   This word has more to do with authority than any kind of like
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   emotional like, right?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   "What is wrong with you, you false prophet?"
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It's not that, okay?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   So is this charge for church leadership or for all believers?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   By what standard?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   All right?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I'm not necessarily going to come up with all kinds of clear
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   answers.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   But I want to point you to some scriptures that will give you
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   some insight, okay?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Matthew 16, 18 to 19, Peter makes a confession of the
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   identity of Jesus.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And Jesus says, "I also say to you that you are Peter and upon
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   overpower it.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven and whatever
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So there's an important role that Peter and the church plays
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   here on earth in regard to eternity.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   You guys understand that?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Okay?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   God ordained the church for a specific reason that has
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   ramifications to eternity, all right?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Verse 18, it talks about Christian and Christian conflict
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   and if there's a sin, someone has to rebuke them, okay?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And that's the context of the next passage.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   If he refuses to listen to the two witnesses, two or three
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   witnesses, if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   church.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   as a Gentile and a tax collector.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   "Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   been bound in heaven, whatever you loose on earth shall have
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   been loosed in heaven."
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Why do I bring this up?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Because there is something about a severe rebuke, if it's not
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   emotional, what is it?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Does it have eternal ramifications?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Does the church have authority basically not necessarily to
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   condemn but to judge somebody severely, to almost declare and
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   proclaim them anathema?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I would say it seems like it.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I would have to do more digging.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So what does he say to Titus?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   What does Paul say to Titus?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   2.1, speak the things.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   2.15, speak and exhort and reprove with all authority.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So Titus, Paul's true child in a common faith, he's been given
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   the authority of church leadership.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   He's not an apostle but he's almost given the authority to be
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   an ambassador for Paul.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   So this is some severe stuff, right?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Chapter 3 verse 8, Paul again says, speak confidently.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   In verse 10, reject a factious man.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So as I'm digging through these things, and I'm not gonna have
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   time to expound on all this, there is a place that God has
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   given to the church to anathematize false teachers.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Okay, now that's been abused in many way, shapes, and forms
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   because the goal was not love, it was just a, you know, I've
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   been offended so get out.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   So I wanna wrestle with this.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And I'm gonna leave you here spiritually constipated so you
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   have to like, oh, what's this mean?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   So what does it mean to be reproving severely?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And is it your job or is it the church's?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Ah, okay, is it the church?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And then immediately in our context today, the reason this
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   is important is because everyone's all speaking badly
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   about the church.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   The church is abusive.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   How many of you guys have heard that?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   The church leaders are authoritarian.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   But God ordained the church, all right?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   So before I throw out a blanket statement like that, even if the
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   church is abusive, it's the institution that God ordained.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I wanna be very careful.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Okay, remember, eisegesis is I'm putting my interpretation into
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   a text.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Exegesis is I'm looking at the text, I'm taking it out, seeing
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   what God means and trying to submit to it.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Regardless of what the culture around me or what churchianity
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   around me suggests that I do, all right?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So I'm gonna leave you here spiritually constipated and I
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   have peace about that, okay?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   So deal with it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Verse 14, "Myths and arrogant commands," but I just titled it
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   that.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I might change it tomorrow, I don't know.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   But that's kinda where I landed.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And what is this?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   We don't know for sure, okay?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   It could be many things.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Religiosity dictates all kinds of stuff and it evolves, okay?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   So some people think it's just genealogies, okay, but what is
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   that?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Not sure exactly.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   It could be rabbinic teachings based on the Old Testament that
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   are a little bit overly legalistic like the Pharisees,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   okay?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   There's some that say that's numerology.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   They're taking like these Hebrew words, you add them up, they
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   give them a value and there's predictions of like all kinds of
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   different stuff, okay?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   So some people think it's this.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   There's a Colossian heresy that was contemporaneous to this.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch, which all refer to
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   things destined to perish with use in accordance with the
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   commandments and teachings of men.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   These are matters which have to be sure, the appearance of
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   wisdom and self-made religion and self-abasement and severe
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   treatment of the body, but of no value against fleshly
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   indulgence."
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Okay, so this is basically asceticism.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Remember, I mentioned hedonism, which is like just giving in to
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   whatever pleasure, and asceticism are two sides of the
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   same coin.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Legalism and cheap grace liberalism, two sides of the same
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   coin.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Both biblical illiteracy.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   You guys following this?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Okay, so when we are exegeting, we're trying to figure out what
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   God has to say rather than imposing our perspective on the
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   text.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   So there's all kinds of stuff going on, alright?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   We don't know exactly what that is, but it's religious practice
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   that is seeking the approval of God, okay?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I'm going to come back to that, alright?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   So I referred you guys before to Mark 7 and Matthew 15, and I'm
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   just going to read you a passage.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Some of you might have already discussed this.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   This is Jesus confronting the Pharisees and then explaining to
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   the disciples, "But in vain do they worship me, teaching as
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   doctrines the precepts of men.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   of men."
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   He was also saying to them, "You are experts at setting aside the
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   commandment of God in order to keep your tradition."
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And he was saying, "That which proceeds out of the man, that is
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   what defiles a man.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   For from within, out of the heart of man, proceed the evil
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   thoughts, fornications, thefts, murder, adulteries, deeds of
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   slander, pride, and foolishness.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man."
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Okay?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   So what is this commandment of God?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And these are just my words, alright?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I just tried to put together like a definition that I would say.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   "All who have fallen short of the glory of God must humble
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   themselves in repentance and faith and be justified freely
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   and only by his grace and thus be restored to their creator and
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   worship him eternally in spirit and in truth."
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   That's my definition.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   What is the commandment of God?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   To love him.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   We were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Amen?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   That's our purpose.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   He doesn't exist for us.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   We exist for him.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Amen?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   We were created by God and for God to love God and to serve
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   God and that is our purpose and sin is not doing that.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Hamartia.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   That's what it is.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Okay?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And what Jewish myths and commandments of men are doing,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   it's to try to tell you that there's a back door.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   You can be restored to God by your own effort.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And that's pretty much the premise of all false religions.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's works based.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   You can get to God is every premise for every false religion.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Okay?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Anything that tells you that you can be good on your own is a
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   false religion.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It's heretical.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And I want to emotionally spell this out for you and my favorite
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   illustration is a mosquito.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   You guys have seen this before.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Here's my question.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   What can Mr. Mosquito do to earn your love and be adopted as your
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   beloved child?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Never bite anybody ever again?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Suck out blood from only bad people and then spit it out into
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   a blood bank?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   What can Mr. Mosquito do to earn your love and be adopted as your
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   beloved child?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Even if he doesn't bite you and he's flying around,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   all of us, what are we going to do?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Eeeeee!
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   That's what we're going to do.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And how many of you guys would be upset if someone next to you
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   kills one of these?
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Nobody.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   If you got upset, I would judge you.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   If there's a mosquito in here flying around and someone kills
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   it, I would laud you.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   I wouldn't be like, eeeeee!
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Do you guys understand this?
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It'd be weird if someone was affectionate toward this mosquito.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Especially if this area had dengue, Zika, right?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Malaria.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   So what can Mr. Mosquito do to earn your love and be adopted as
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   your beloved child?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   No matter what it does, that will never happen.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   You guys following this?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   The distance between me and God, the distance between me and
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   mosquito, what is the greater distance?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Infinitely between me and God is a greater distance.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   So for man to say that I can appease holy God somehow is the
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   heartbeat of every heresy.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's the heartbeat of the Jewish myths.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   It's the heartbeat of circumcision.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   It's based a little bit on truths that we may have heard in
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   the past.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But there's no thing that you and I can do to make ourselves
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   more lovable.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And to teach that we can is utter arrogance and heresy.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   That's the emotion of it.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Not sure if you guys get that.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   What can he do?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   What if he buys you a flower?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   First of all, that's impossible.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   He would get killed on the way there, okay?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Impossible.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   But that's our lot.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   This is us.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Poopah.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   It's called poopah but I prefer the term poopah.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   It helps to emphasize.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   This is us.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Ephesians 2 calls us children, the technon of wrath.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   We only deserve wrath.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   So to say that these guys can do something good to you is utter
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   stupidity.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Us to please holy, holy, holy God by some kind of morning
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   prayer, by some kind of cutting, by some kind of donation or
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   offering, by some kind of service, by some kind of
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   manipulation is not just utter stupidity, it's arrogance.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And that's why that kind of teaching needs to be slapped in
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   the face.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   In love.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Okay?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   So how does one become sound in the faith?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   We have no hope outside of Christ.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And this is not just me proselytizing here.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   This is Titus.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And I'll show you where.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   The problem is in the heart.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   So sinners cannot purify their own hearts through ritual, deed
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   or effort.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Amen?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   You guys following that?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   You can do nothing.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   You need a new heart is what the Bible teaches.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Fortunately God gives it to you.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   He takes away your heart of what?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Stone gives you a heart of flesh.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Not only that, he changes your spiritual DNA.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   He implants himself into you to effect change.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   You cannot be a Christian and not look like a Christian.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   It's impossible.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Okay?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Those with new or pure hearts now cannot help but to engage in
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   good deeds.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   That's a teaching of Titus.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And I will show you where.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Okay?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   This is a slide I had for the first week.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Alright?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   In every chapter there is an incarnation of Christ.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   You guys notice this?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And he's always called our Savior.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   God our Savior, God our Savior, God our Savior.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It's unique to Titus.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   It comes out again and again.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Chapter 1 verses 1 through 3.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   God promised this.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Chapter 2, 11 to 15.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   God redeems.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   God purifies.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Right?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Where does it say?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Who gave himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed and
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   to purify for himself.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And chapter 3 verses 4 through 8 is the third Christology there.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   God washes, God renews, God justifies.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   So any Jewish myth and the commandment of men that basically
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   commands you to do something to appease God is what needs to be
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   rebuked.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Okay?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   You guys follow that?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   It's all over Titus.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And we just finished chapter 1.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   That you cannot get to God by your own effort.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Now, some of you, the immature thought may be, oh,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   then good deeds are not important.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Right?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   There's nothing I can do to get to God.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Amen.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   But good deeds are all over the Titus.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Okay?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Now, before we get that, I'm just going to briefly talk about
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   verse 15 and 16.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And I mentioned every false religious system is a works-based
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   righteousness.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And that's arrogance.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And the sin that God hates the most is arrogance.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Well, what's interesting is inner purity,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   and this is kind of touching upon launching off of verse 15.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Inner purity always produces outer purity.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Measurable and good deeds.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   You will look like your spiritual father.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It's impossible not to.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Okay?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   So for someone who is pure, all things are pure.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   All things are pure.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   What he does doesn't affect that status.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   But he's got the spirit of God not only as a pledge and as a
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   promise, but it's a sanctifying, effectual work that God's spirit
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   is doing.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And he will produce good deeds.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Because the bridegroom takes ownership of the bride and
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   purifies her for himself.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   And look at how many times good deeds is used.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Verse 16, deeds, worthless for any good deed.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Verse 2, chapter 2, verse 7, example of good deeds.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Redeem us from every lawless deed.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   14, zealous for good deeds.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Be ready for good deed.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Verse 5, he saved us on the basis of deeds.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Chapter 3, verse 8, carefully engage in good deeds.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And verse 14 is the second to last verse.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   It's the 45th verse of Titus.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   It says, "Our people."
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   So just in case you guys didn't get it, our people, Titus, must
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs so
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   that we will not be unfruitful is what he says.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   So are good deeds important?
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Absolutely.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   You cannot have a Christian life without good deeds.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   But you can't get to God on the basis of your deeds.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And that's kind of how you can sum up the latter part of
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   chapter 1 and what it is that we are supposed to go head on
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   against, okay?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   So most of the world around you, the people at your work and at
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   your schools and your families, they don't think they're an
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   offense to God, right?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Because they compare horizontally.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Yeah, Emily, I'm a little more moral than, yeah, her.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   John Lee, yeah, that guy, he's a scoundrel.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I'm better than him.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Jamie, yeah, she just is like grossly hypocritical.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   This is all make-believe, okay?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   But this is how people think.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   You know, I share this is when George Floyd's death happened,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   you guys remember, it was about a year ago.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   That night, for some reason, in my prayer, I identified with
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Derek Chauvin, the cop.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   And I was like, there's the bystanders, there's that Asian
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   cop, there's the other cop there, there's George Floyd on
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   the ground, and there's Derek Chauvin.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I'm him.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Because that guy probably did not wake up planning to kill
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   somebody and starting a nationwide riot.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   He just got provoked enough to where the stuff inside came out
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   and he ended up killing a guy.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   I'm capable of that.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   You're capable of that.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   You and I are no better than Donald Trump.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   We are no better than Joe Biden.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   We are no better than Hitler.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   That's the teaching of the gospel.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   We're only justified freely by his grace.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Right?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   But being justified freely by his grace produces crazy change
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   because God takes responsibility.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Okay?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So, that's today's teaching kind of in a nutshell.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   There's a lot that I ended up having to carve out.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Otherwise, you guys would be here just tomorrow, okay?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   But just sit there spiritually constipated and flesh these
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   things out on your own.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   What does it mean?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Okay?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   So, here's the application.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   What is the evidence that you know God or don't know God?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And this is very encouraging for me to do for myself.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   2 Corinthians 13, 5, examine yourselves to see whether you're
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   of the faith.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Don't you realize that Christ Jesus is in you?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Unless, of course, you fail the test.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   In verse 6, Paul says, "I hope you realize yourselves don't
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   fail the test as apostles."
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Okay?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Later in verse 10, he goes severely, okay?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   But we are called to examine our hearts.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   We're called to quote Psalm 139, "Search me, O Lord,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   know my heart.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   See if there's any hurtful in me.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Lead me in the way everlasting."
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   So, what is evidence that you know God?
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   When you look at you five years from before,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   are you a different person now?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   It should be super encouraging because if you look at yourself
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   now, you're probably going to be disgusted.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   I'm disgusted.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   I'm like, I'm still so far from where I need to be.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   But I look a lot more like Jesus than I did 10 years ago.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And that I can say with confidence.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And that's not because I try harder.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   It's because God is -- his DNA is coming out.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Okay?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   So, what is evidence that you know God or do you not know God?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Is this all religiosity?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And the second question is, in what ways are you holding fast
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   to the traditions of men?
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Okay?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   In what ways are you holding fast to the faithful word?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Now, are all traditions bad?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Are all the traditions of men bad?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Not necessarily.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Right?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   If you're doing these traditions like morning prayer,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   I mentioned that in my group.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Korean peoples, they love their morning prayers.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Right?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   They go there early in the morning because the earlier you
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   go, the more blessed you are.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   The Lord sees that I sacrificed my three hours of sleep and he
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   will bless me.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Is there anything wrong with morning prayer?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Absolutely not.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   But if you're going there to manipulate God, that is evil.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   But to go there to seek the Lord, that's honorable.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   That's a tradition of man.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   No word does it say in the Bible to go pray early in the morning
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   as a command.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Jesus did it in Mark chapter 1 verse 35, I think.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   He did it.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   But that's not descriptive.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   That's what he did.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   There are traditions that we have that we pollute, corrupt,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   and pervert.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   But the traditions in and of themselves are not what's wrong.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   It's the desire either to offer worship or to manipulate God is
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   what is wrong.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Are you guys following this?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Okay?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   So there's a lot in here and there's going to continue to be
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   a lot because from next week on, we're doing five verses a week.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   We started out with baby steps with three and today we did four
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   and some of you guys are like, it doesn't fit in the paper.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Right?
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   But starting next week, it's five.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Okay?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   So with the remaining time, just go over this.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   In what ways are you holding fast?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Okay?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   In what ways are you holding fast the faithful word?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   All right?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And it's not the same word in the Greek, but they're cousins,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   same root.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Okay?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Let me pray for us and then we'll dismiss to our groups.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Thank you, Father, for your kindness that has led many of us
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   to repentance.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And we are not here because we earned this.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   From the beginning of our walk with you to where we sit today
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   has all been grace.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   I pray that you would help us to appreciate it rather than to
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   take it for granted, neglect it, and abuse it so that the world
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   will see through our testimony that you indeed are a very
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   powerful good God.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   There's a lot of false teaching that is in and around our
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   churches and we pray that you would help us to combat them,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   not to self-promote, but really to honor your truth and to fight
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   for your truth, remembering that the goal of all this, though,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   is love.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   So help us to be loving ambassadors to this dying world
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   in both spirit and in truth.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   And we thank you, Lord, for just your provision of the couple
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   hours that we had to study.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And this is next week, no Bible study.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   This is next time.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I'm gonna put this up on Facebook, but it's chapter 2,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   verses 1 through 5.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   No Bible study next Wednesday, but two Wednesdays from now.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   All right?
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   And I just leave you with this.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   2, 1 through 5 is the next assignment.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   assignment.
