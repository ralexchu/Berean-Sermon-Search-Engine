[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:34.920]   - All right, good morning, Church family.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.760]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.640]   I hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.420]   We will now begin with our Sunday service.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.840]   I'm gonna read for us from Psalm 86, eight to 12.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.640]   And David prays before the Lord.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.520]   There is no one like you among the gods, O Lord,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.040]   nor are there any works like yours.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.360]   All nations whom you have made shall come
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.480]   and worship before you, O Lord,
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.520]   and they shall glorify your name.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.320]   For you are great and do wondrous deeds.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.200]   You alone are God.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.400]   Teach me your way, O Lord.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.280]   I will walk in your truth.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.260]   Unite my heart to fear your name.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.120]   I will give thanks to you, O Lord, my God,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.760]   with all my heart, and I will glorify your name forever.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.560]   So let us sing these verses and praise our God together.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.180]   (gentle music)

[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:50.720]   - All right, good morning.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.120]   Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.680]   Let me just get straight to the announcements.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.120]   First of all, this coming Saturday,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.960]   we have a men's fellowship that's going on
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.320]   Saturday at 9.30 in this room.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.240]   And just to kind of clarify,
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.040]   this Saturday, the subject that we're gonna be covering
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.640]   is biblical manhood.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.440]   You know, I know, especially in our culture right now,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.320]   like just to say you're a man,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.640]   you know, it gets negative attention.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.880]   And so we wanted to clarify,
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.840]   what does the Bible teach us about biblical manhood?
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.920]   And so please come at 9.30.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.040]   We're gonna have light breakfast,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.200]   and then we're gonna be having a lunch
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   that's donated to us.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.280]   And so we'll explain more when you come there.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.560]   So you don't wanna miss that.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.480]   So please sign up for that
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.280]   if you haven't signed up for that.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.960]   Next Sunday, we have a members meeting
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.920]   after service at 2 p.m.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.960]   And so again, this is a mandatory meeting
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.840]   for all the members.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.560]   And if you can't come, please let us know.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.800]   Give us a heads up on that.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.640]   But along with that, our college department
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.780]   is doing a fundraiser that Sunday.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.440]   And so they're gonna be providing chipotle bowls
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.600]   for $8 at a discount.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.640]   Normally it's $10,
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.440]   but they're gonna be giving to you for $8, all right,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.440]   because of the inflation.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.080]   $8 to save you some money.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.800]   $8, so it'll be second service.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.720]   So you'll be able to stick around here and grab lunch,
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.200]   and then we'll start the meeting right at 2 p.m., okay?
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.560]   And then the other thing is,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.120]   Second Peter Bible study sign up.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.800]   So if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.620]   the sooner you guys let us know
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.680]   that you're planning to come,
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.180]   our small groups and home groups
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.080]   need to be planned ahead of time.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.960]   So please let us know so that we can prepare for that.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.440]   Okay, I think that's it for the announcements.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.820]   Yeah, so after today, we have a members,
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.360]   not the new members introduction lunch
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.340]   that's happening at a park.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.020]   So you should know where that is.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.140]   So after the service, if you can head to that park,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.980]   and we'll be having lunch in over there
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.480]   and give you a brief introduction.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.080]   And then next Sunday, we'll introduce you to the church.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.760]   So just to kind of give you a heads up on that, okay?
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.360]   All right, so I'll give you a minute after I pray
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.820]   to give your electronic offering.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.760]   And then if you do have a physical offering,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.180]   there is a box in the back.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.540]   As you're exiting, you can drop it off there, okay?
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.380]   Let's pray.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:03.420]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.500]   for your continued work in our lives.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.140]   Those things that we know of,
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.460]   and those things that you are working behind the scenes
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.900]   to work together all things
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.220]   for those who love you and been called.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.280]   We pray Father that you give us grace this morning.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.760]   No matter what kind of distractions
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.040]   that we may have brought into this worship,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.320]   help us Lord God to fix our eyes upon Christ.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.360]   Help us to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.760]   May be lifted up as a pleasing aroma and sacrifice.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.760]   Even the giving that we give, help us to give cheerfully
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.640]   that it may be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.520]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.000]   (soft piano music)

[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:43.300]   - Amen, you may be seated.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:52.140]   If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter two.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:59.560]   I'll be reading from verse one through seven.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.300]   But we're really looking at all the way up to verse 20.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:09.800]   I'm just gonna ask for your understanding
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.220]   'cause I have candy in my mouth.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.140]   I have a cough drop in my mouth
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.220]   and I've had this lingering cough
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.840]   and I know some people were like,
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.400]   is that guy gonna spread COVID?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.980]   I had this even before, in a lighter version of it,
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.980]   before I went to India and Korea.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.100]   And then it just got worse.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.980]   So I don't wanna be coughing throughout the sermon.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.720]   So I'm just gonna have the candy in my mouth.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.520]   So it's a cough drop, okay.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.140]   I was telling my family that I think it's 'cause the cats,
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.600]   but they refused to accept it, right?
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.840]   So I'm gonna be having a cat
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.520]   'cause I just don't wanna cough.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.560]   If you can turn to Luke chapter two, one through seven,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.260]   let me read that and we'll jump in.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.400]   Now in the days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.320]   that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.560]   This was the first census taken while Quirinius
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.240]   was governor of Syria.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.160]   And everyone was on his way to register for the census,
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.920]   each to his own city.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.680]   Joseph also went up from Galilee,
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.440]   from the city of Nazareth to Judea,
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.260]   to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.560]   because he was of the house of family of David.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.240]   In order to register along with Mary,
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.120]   who was engaged to him and was with child.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.960]   While they were there,
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.700]   the days were completed for her to give birth.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.780]   And she gave birth to her firstborn son
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.680]   and she wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.120]   because there was no room for them in the inn.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:34.960]   Let's pray.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.480]   Gracious and loving father,
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.520]   open our eyes, soften our hearts,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.680]   help us to receive your word as you have intended it.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.520]   Help us not to turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   Help us not to take away from it or to add to it.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.120]   May your word that you have ordained come forth
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.800]   and not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.680]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:05.020]   You know, whenever I go to DMV
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.640]   or you know, where I have to tell them my name
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.600]   and they have to look up my name,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.840]   usually I go through this cycle of, you know,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.880]   they ask me what my name is.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.320]   I say, I'm Peter Kim.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.440]   And then they type it up in their database.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.840]   And they said, well, there's 3000 Peter Kim's in here.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.680]   Which one?
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.040]   I say, Peter Ho Kim.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.320]   And then they'll say, well, there's 30 Peter Ho Kim's
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.400]   in here, so which Peter Ho Kim are you?
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.240]   So eventually I have to go and give them my address
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.520]   and give them more information in order for them
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.320]   to identify and to say, is this you?
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.580]   Is yes.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.160]   Well, I had a whole different version of that
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.200]   when I was in India because I was getting COVID tested
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.760]   in order to get into Korea.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.580]   And they asked me what my name was and say, Peter Kim.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.160]   But their database is the international database,
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.400]   not Orange County.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.040]   And then they looked it up and they said,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.080]   looks like there's over 30,000 of you in here.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.700]   So which Peter Kim are you?
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.160]   So I had to nail it down to the United States
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.080]   or Orange County, and then I actually had to give them
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.920]   my address and my passport number and say, is this you?
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.640]   And I had to go through this to find out exactly who I am.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.920]   So obviously in that context, I need to be able
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   to identify who I am so that they can put it
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.360]   on their database so when I go into different countries,
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.440]   they can say, oh, he's vaccinated or he did this or that.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.920]   You know, what's interesting is as we try
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   to identify ourselves, maybe your name
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.400]   is not as common as mine.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.680]   Kim is a very common name in Korea.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.280]   So typically when you meet another Kim in Korea,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.720]   they'll ask you what kind of Kim are you, right?
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.280]   'Cause it's spelled the same way.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.000]   So my Korean, my family's name is Gyeongju Kim.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.560]   Gyeongju Kim is the area that we came from, right?
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.760]   And so that's kind of how we,
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.880]   so it kind of tells you the clan, right?
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.520]   But what's interesting is whenever I talk to a Lee, Park,
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.400]   you know, Choi or whatever their last name is
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.160]   and it kind of ties us to our ancestry,
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.240]   most people will add on top of that.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.800]   It's like, oh yeah, our great, great, great, great grandfather
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.460]   was the last king of Korea, right?
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.960]   I've never heard a descendant from peasants, ever.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.840]   Like no matter what country you're from,
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   somewhere in the line, somebody is a king.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.240]   You know, I've never heard somebody say,
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.720]   "Oh, I'm a Kim, yeah, my dad used to take care of cows."
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.560]   Or, "My great, great grandfather
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.280]   was a servant of this great king."
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.000]   So almost everybody has descendants
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.400]   coming from a king somewhere.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.040]   So obviously we're not all from kings.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.600]   Somebody must be wrong.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.520]   Somewhere down the line, somebody added, you know,
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.980]   or misinformation and they just kind of came in
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.160]   because that's what you want to embrace.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.560]   I mean, whether that's true or not,
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.040]   all it does is add a sense of pride
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.080]   because, you know, it's somewhere.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.220]   Maybe our present circumstance is humble,
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.800]   but at some point in our line,
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.540]   at somewhere way up in the line,
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.220]   we had somebody very important in our family.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.760]   Whether that's true or not, it's really not that important.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.640]   But the identity of Christ is absolutely crucial
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.680]   to identify that Jesus is the fulfillment
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.840]   of the prophecies that's been given for thousands of years.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.560]   In fact, the Bible has over 25 separate genealogies
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.280]   that are mentioned.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.520]   And most people, when they run to study the Bible,
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.820]   they don't go to the genealogies, right?
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.380]   Even those of you who are studious,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.060]   genealogies are usually something
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.200]   that you just kind of skim over.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.840]   You recognize a few names and then you go back.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.280]   But there's a reason why there are so many genealogies
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.760]   in the Bible, because the genealogies
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.200]   are record of God fulfilling his promise
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.940]   all the way from the fall,
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.020]   when he says the seed of the woman is gonna come
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.720]   and crush the head of the serpent.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.600]   All the genealogies, the record of God's faithfulness,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.640]   fulfilling his promise from generation
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.580]   to generation to generation.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.040]   You know, what's also interesting is
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.640]   when we read this text,
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.940]   typically this is where we land on Christmas
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.660]   and we hear about Jesus' story.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:00.140]   But when we read this in our modern day,
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.320]   we look at it and say, oh, it's a story about Jesus' birth.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.520]   But imagine if you are an individual,
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.660]   Christian or non-Christian,
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.680]   and you're reading this for the first time,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.740]   the person that is highlighted here is Caesar Augustus.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.480]   This is the Caesar of Rome,
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.280]   the greatest powerful empire of that time.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.280]   And so naturally you would gravitate
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.320]   towards Caesar Augustus.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.380]   In fact, Caesar Augustus is not a name, it's a title.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.920]   Caesar is basically the emperor of Rome.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.320]   And Augustus, until this man,
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.200]   was never even used of a human being.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.240]   Augustus basically means honored or exalted one.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.600]   So because he was so popular for the first time,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.520]   they actually attributed that to a human being.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.680]   And so if you were reading this in the first century,
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.200]   it's like Caesar Augustus?
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.240]   What is he doing?
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.360]   But now we look at it and Caesar Augustus
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.920]   is actually just a side comment.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.220]   In fact, rest of this morning,
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.120]   I'm not even gonna mention him.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.640]   Because it just happens that God used him
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.480]   to fulfill what he was doing.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.520]   But the highlight of this whole story
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.880]   is about this child
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.120]   who come from no significant background,
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.640]   born of a young teenage girl in a manger
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.840]   with shepherds as a witness,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.080]   would have been insignificant compared to this man.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.160]   But now 2,000 years later, knowing who he is,
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.500]   he's the central figure of this story.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.820]   There's a reason for that.
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.440]   Because all of this is a fulfillment
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.160]   and is a record of God's faithful promise.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.000]   That Jesus is the fulfillment of the promise
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   in Micah chapter five two it says,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.600]   but as for you Bethlehem Ephraith,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.960]   too little to be among the clans of Judah.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.240]   From you one will go forth from me to be ruler in Israel.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   His goings forth are from long ago,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.200]   from the days of eternity.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.640]   In other words, this fulfillment of this prophecy
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.920]   is not a random set of events.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.600]   The genealogical records are not random set of events.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.160]   This is something that God has ordained.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.720]   In fact, if you remember, in the previous,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.880]   it talked about this fulfillment
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.440]   of the son of God that's coming.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   I mean, son of the most high God.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.360]   He's not just a fulfillment of the King Leland,
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.120]   which clearly he is because Bethlehem
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.640]   basically means city of David,
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.660]   and he's going back to have a concrete record
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.000]   that this is who he is.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.160]   He's coming from the tribe of Judah.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.160]   But more than that, if you remember Mary's,
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.840]   if you remember the prophecy,
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.880]   he says he's not just a human king.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.920]   He's the son of the most high God,
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.960]   and he's going to be the eternal ruler
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.320]   and establish a kingdom that's gonna be everlasting.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.200]   So if you understood and you heard that prophecy,
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.400]   what do you think would have been the next event?
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.480]   Some parade, maybe?
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.440]   Maybe the kings of Rome or at least in Israel,
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.440]   they would have prepared and you would have thought
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.240]   that there were gonna be a gigantic crowd to receive them.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.600]   Instead, there's this chaotic scene
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   of a non-month pregnant child who's moving around,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   you know, not knowing where she's gonna give birth.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.400]   The storyline is pretty clear,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.720]   what Luke is trying to convey.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.800]   Luke is not just gathering random facts
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.720]   and just putting it together
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.780]   and theophilus hears a record.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.600]   There's a point that Luke is trying to make,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.840]   and it's pretty clear,
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.720]   that God's perfect plan is unfolding through humble means.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.220]   God's perfect plan is unfolding through humble means.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.440]   You would expect something spectacular is happening,
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.080]   but this is consistent with what we saw in chapter one.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.140]   Remember, he said the son of God is coming,
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.560]   and then prophecy comes to Zacharias and Elizabeth
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.460]   that they're gonna have a child.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.940]   This is an old couple,
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.240]   beyond years of being able to bear children,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.100]   and God blesses them,
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.360]   and they're able to have a child.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.240]   Now, we talked about that last few Sundays,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.640]   that in this particular time,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.800]   to not be able to have children
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.120]   was considered possibly a curse from God,
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.440]   even though it had nothing to do with God.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.920]   God prepared them for this blessing,
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.800]   but the nation of Israel
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.960]   kind of whispered from the background,
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.120]   they must have done something wrong,
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.100]   kind of like Job's friends.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.200]   When he was suffering, they were kind of telling him,
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.040]   "You must have done something wrong."
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   It was to this humbled old couple that this prophecy comes.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.620]   In fact, in Mary's song,
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.360]   her whole song is, "The reason God chose me," she says,
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.400]   "is because I was humble."
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.120]   And then the rest of the prophecy basically,
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.680]   or the Psalms, goes,
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.700]   God, how he humbled the proud, the kingdoms,
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.500]   and he raises up,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.300]   raises up those who are humble.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.340]   In fact, John the Baptist, where we left off, right?
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.820]   Jesus calls him the greatest of all those
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.880]   who are born of a woman until the time of Christ
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.500]   into the new covenant.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.460]   But what made John so great?
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.020]   After the prophecy, how he's gonna go ahead
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.700]   and prepare the way for the Messiah and the king,
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.100]   he basically goes out into the desert.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.900]   Most of his life, probably loses his aged parents,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.140]   and lived and grew as an orphan out in the desert.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.060]   We don't hear about him
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.780]   until about six months before Jesus shows up.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.880]   And then he goes out preaching
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.140]   and prepare the way of Christ,
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.900]   repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.340]   And then after Jesus shows up,
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.380]   he lives maybe another six months,
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.760]   and then he's beheaded and he dies.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.540]   So when we talk about John the Baptist
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.820]   being the greatest of all the other prophets,
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.160]   what made him greater than Moses?
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.340]   What made him greater than Elijah?
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.060]   What made him great?
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.780]   All we know is that short period
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.860]   where he stood before the coming of Christ to point to him.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.540]   And so all we know is his greatness
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.860]   was related to his proximity to Christ and his humility.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.360]   That when Christ came, all he did was say,
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.660]   "I must decrease and he must increase."
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:59.700]   And in the same line, as Jesus,
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.300]   the King of kings and Lord of Lord is coming,
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.760]   the story of the birth of Christ begins with this edict.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.540]   And can you imagine of that time when it says,
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.140]   the way it's spelled out is that all of the known earth,
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.180]   obviously under Rome's rule,
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.280]   was given an edict to go back to their hometown,
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.860]   their ancestral hometown, not where they grew up,
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.780]   not where they were born, but their ancestors.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.400]   Clearly God's hand is in that.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:31.620]   Because there's a clear record of Jesus' heritage
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.580]   that's coming from the line of Judah.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:38.880]   But can you imagine the historical scene of what's going on?
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.820]   Everybody packing their bags.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:45.820]   If there was an edict in our generation and said,
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.020]   you have to go back to your ancestor home
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.740]   and to be counted and you have the next three months
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.780]   to do so, can you imagine the chaos that's gonna break out?
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.380]   Almost every single person in this room,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.920]   I would say probably every single person in this room,
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.820]   and no matter what stage in life you are,
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.120]   maybe you're in the middle of business,
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.740]   or maybe you're waiting for something,
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.780]   maybe your wife is pregnant,
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.140]   doesn't matter what circumstance you are in,
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.300]   everybody has to pack their bags, find tickets,
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.960]   and you gotta go back to whatever country,
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.860]   whatever place you're in,
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.260]   'cause I don't think anybody was here in Irvine,
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.060]   right, a thousand years ago, right?
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.820]   So can you imagine what that was like?
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.040]   Everybody just packing their bags and leaving.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.140]   I remember the closest thing to this I experienced
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.940]   when I was in Beijing in 1993 on our first trip
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.340]   while I was a seminary student.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.080]   It was right at the beginning of the Spring Festival.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.780]   And so those of you guys who know about the Spring Festival,
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.580]   that's like, they give you about one month to go back home.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:49.480]   And this is a period in 1993 where it wasn't
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.580]   the country it is now, where it's very developed
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.180]   and everybody's riding cars, but I would say 90, 95%
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.780]   of Beijing was still riding bicycles.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.820]   And so the only transportation that they had
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.500]   to be able to get somewhere far is to get on this train.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.140]   Now, so you have to remember at that time,
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.920]   where people lived was basically
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.200]   where the government told you to.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.160]   So if you were a good student and you graduated
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.820]   and they made you an engineer, they'll say,
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.300]   there's a company that run by the state
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.460]   and we need you to live over there.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.320]   So they would sometimes move you hundreds,
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.660]   sometimes thousands of miles away from you.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.940]   And so only during the Spring Festival,
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.260]   if you saved up enough money, you can buy a ticket
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.100]   and then get on the train and get back home.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.780]   But if you're not able to go back home,
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.220]   basically you have a whole another year
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.460]   you have to wait until you can buy the ticket and go home.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.980]   So can you imagine the number of people
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.460]   who are headed toward the train station
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.660]   at the beginning of the Spring Festival?
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.540]   We just happened to be traveling right at that time.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.700]   And so when we went to the train station,
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.540]   there were pictures, large cardboard pictures
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.060]   of just mangled people everywhere.
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.940]   It was just gruesome.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.940]   I said, why are they doing this?
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.380]   So I asked the guy who was guiding us.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.420]   It's like, why are they hanging these gruesome pictures
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.940]   at the train station?
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.940]   And they said that every year we have so many hundreds
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.380]   of thousands of people who get mangled on the train
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.180]   because they are trying so hard to get on the train.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.620]   And so if they can't get on and get regular seats--
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.500]   regular seats mean even just standing,
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.220]   sometimes they would have to go for three, four days.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.420]   But so many people just hanging on from the outside
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.100]   because that's the only way that they can get home.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.140]   And as a result of that, many hundreds, hundreds,
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.780]   sometimes thousands of them will be thrown under the train
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.460]   and get mangled.
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.940]   So they would put these pictures to scare people,
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.480]   that if you try to get on this train,
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.500]   this is going to happen.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.940]   Now, I know that during this period when the people were
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.620]   moving around, maybe the population wasn't as big.
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.260]   But can you imagine the chaos?
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.620]   You would expect that after a prophecy of the king,
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.340]   son of the most high god who's going
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.860]   to conquer all their enemies and bring about final peace,
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.820]   that you would think that there would be something else going
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.500]   on right after.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.180]   But the very next scene, we see utter chaos.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.980]   Mary, who's nine months pregnant--
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.420]   those of you who have children or experienced pregnancy,
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.760]   if she's nine months pregnant, she's about to give birth,
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.860]   do you make travel plans?
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.020]   No.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.480]   You can't even come to the retreat
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.260]   if it's too close to the date, because if it happens,
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.420]   you have to be closer to the hospital.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.460]   But can you imagine being nine months pregnant,
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.260]   and she's about to give birth, and now they
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.760]   got to pack up and travel 80 miles from where
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:31.600]   they are to move to Bethlehem, just because of the census?
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.500]   Now, 80 miles at that time, just normal, healthy adults
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.560]   would take them about five or six days.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.480]   But with her being fully pregnant--
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.480]   and typically, when we see Mary traveling,
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.720]   we see her on a donkey and Joseph kind of carrying her
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.820]   along--
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.760]   that may have been the case.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.260]   But we know that they weren't rich.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.140]   They didn't have money.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.680]   So the possibility that they may have
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.080]   walked this whole process is probably highly likely,
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:01.040]   that this 13, 14-year-old teenage girl with the husband
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:01.560]   who is--
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.680]   with Joseph, who's only a couple of years older,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.360]   is in the middle of this chaos.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:14.160]   And remember, she's holding the King of Israel in her stomach.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.480]   So can you imagine what she was thinking?
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.240]   You prophesy that I'm going to give birth
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.040]   to the King of Kings, and this is how he's going to come?
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.880]   Out on the street?
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   In fact, you know what's interesting is, most likely,
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.120]   they made this journey alone.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.480]   And the reason why I believe that is because in Luke
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   chapter 2, 5, it says, "In order to register along with Mary,
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.040]   who was engaged to him and was engaged."
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.840]   Remember nine months ago when the prophecy came,
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.360]   how Joseph responded to that?
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.680]   That she's not even married with her yet,
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.520]   but during the time of engagement,
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.960]   prophecy comes and says, your wife is pregnant.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.160]   Prophecy comes and says, your wife is pregnant.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.240]   And so Joseph's response in Matthew 1, 19,
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.560]   it says, "Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.240]   and not wanting to disgrace her, planned
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.360]   to send her away secretly."
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.160]   So Joseph was very concerned.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.320]   Being a righteous man, he could have just blasted it
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.980]   and said, how could she have done this?
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.880]   And then to save face, dismiss her.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.680]   To shame her and her family and him go his own way
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.160]   and marry another person.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.600]   But instead, the angel comes and reminds him,
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.840]   he's like, this is not because she was unfaithful.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.120]   In fact, exactly the opposite.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.720]   God has favored her.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.480]   And this child is a son of God.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.520]   But he did this, he says, discreetly.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.360]   And most likely, my guess is that people around them
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.960]   did not believe that.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.720]   All they know is that this young girl that
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.920]   was betrothed to Joseph was pregnant.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.360]   And maybe they tried to tell them,
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.860]   but I don't know how many of them I would actually believe
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.600]   it.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.480]   Because even Zacharias and Elizabeth
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   had a hard time believing.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.600]   So my guess is they kind of kept it discreet.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.040]   And it says, on this journey, they were still engaged
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.640]   nine months later.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.240]   So they waited until she gave birth.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.160]   Maybe start over somewhere new.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.400]   So this whole journey, being discreet,
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.760]   maybe running away from shame, pointing fingers
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:15.400]   for where they were at, and they're moving along.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.560]   And then finally, when they get to Bethlehem,
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.760]   all these people were traveling back.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.480]   All these people, maybe ancestors
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.720]   come from Bethlehem.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.400]   They probably got there first.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.200]   Because she was pregnant, so it probably took her longer.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.760]   A normal adult would take five days.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.960]   My guess is it would have taken her many more days than that.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.520]   So by the time they arrive, the inn is completely full.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.520]   And as a result, she ends up giving birth.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.800]   And Jesus is in the manger.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.600]   Manger, basically, is where the animals eat their food
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.920]   and drink their water.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.560]   You know, what's interesting was years ago--
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.120]   now we have funds, and we're doing all this stuff,
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.720]   and we have a nice portable baptismal.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.040]   But years ago, when our church didn't have money--
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.080]   we're Baptist, so we need to have a baptismal.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.820]   But we couldn't afford a nice one, right?
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.500]   So we were researching online, and I was researching,
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.480]   and I found that a lot of the churches who don't have money
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.880]   would buy this tin tank.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.800]   It's about 200 gallons.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.320]   And it's big enough where an average adult can get and dunk.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.920]   So they would take this outside, fill it with water,
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.760]   and then that's where they would do baptism.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.600]   So a few churches, not many, found
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.000]   that they were using that because they didn't have money.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.160]   So we were very tempted to get that
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.400]   because we didn't have money.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.640]   And it was only a couple hundred bucks.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.360]   And at the end, I decided not to do that
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.280]   because we're getting baptized, and people are starting
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.440]   their new life in Christ, and we have guests coming,
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.980]   and they're bringing their testimony,
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.280]   and they're going to go into this tin tank
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.120]   where the horses drink their water.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.160]   And people are going to come, and it's like, what is this?
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.000]   So for that purpose, it's kind of humiliating
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.840]   to present this in this tank.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.320]   And so we decided not to do that.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.180]   Well, this is the Son of God, the Son of God
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:13.080]   that was prophesied, who's going to bring eternal peace.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.080]   They come, and he's in a manger.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.000]   This is not by accident.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.660]   It wasn't because they didn't have money.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.840]   This is not by accident.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.760]   God is clearly trying to do something here.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.600]   In fact, the first group of people
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.120]   that are given to be a testimony of this,
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.240]   it says they were shepherds.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.440]   Now, you have to understand, the shepherds at that time
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.560]   was a dirty profession.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:39.840]   It was probably the lowliest of profession,
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.560]   not only because they were around animals all the time,
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.280]   and they were dirty, and they smelled like animals.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.160]   The Jews considered them unclean,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.680]   because they were around unclean animals all the time.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.760]   So they said, oh, they must also be unclean.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.200]   And so not only were they physically the lowliest,
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.160]   even spiritually, these are people
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.120]   that they wouldn't want to have in their house.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:06.160]   And Luke emphasizes, it was the shepherds that were noted.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.620]   And then they were the ones to come,
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.160]   and they were the ones to praise God,
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.560]   and they were the first witnesses to tell other people.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.640]   It's not by accident.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.080]   In fact, in the book of Matthew, it
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.760]   says that the Magi were alerted.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.200]   They saw the prophecy of the star, which
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.160]   represents the King of Israel is going to come.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.100]   And when they found out about this, where did they go?
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:32.520]   Straight to the king, King Herod,
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.640]   and gathered the high priest, because they
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.040]   wanted to find out where this was going to happen.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.640]   Why did they go to King Herod?
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.480]   Where else would the king be?
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.000]   When the Magi, these Gentiles, heard about this,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.960]   and this prophecy was going to be fulfilled,
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.080]   not knowing what's going to happen, of course,
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.000]   they went to the King of Israel and asked.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.120]   This prophecy being fulfilled, where is this king?
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.300]   And obviously, King Herod, understanding this,
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.200]   in fear of losing his throne, sends an edict
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.880]   to kill all the babies, male children.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.560]   And so the Magi are alerted.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.800]   Don't go back.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.560]   You may not survive this.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.520]   And then they follow the star that takes them
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.560]   to where Jesus is.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.080]   Can you imagine the shock of the Magi
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.880]   when they went to the king and are rejected,
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.120]   and then they actually follow the star
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.320]   to where the real king is, and he's in a manger?
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.080]   It doesn't record their reaction,
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.560]   but you could imagine what their reaction is.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.760]   This is the king?
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   King of Israel in a manger with these children.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.480]   How can this be the king?
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.120]   Again, it's not recorded their reaction,
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.360]   but all of this is not by accident.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.840]   Luke is not just bringing together just random set of facts,
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.280]   random set of things that took place,
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.720]   and said it just happens to be that this is the context
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.040]   in which Jesus came.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.240]   Luke is emphasizing every single part of this for a reason.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.720]   We talked about this last time,
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   that God who is exalted emptied himself, became nothing,
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.280]   in order to walk among us
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.520]   so that he can be a sympathetic high priest.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.920]   Every part of the call of Christian life
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.920]   is to empty ourselves, not to become something,
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:25.480]   not to gain notoriety, not to become this great name,
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.960]   but to empty ourselves so that we can be useful.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.760]   Remember in Matthew 8, verse 20,
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.120]   the scribes come to Jesus because he's beginning
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.400]   to get fame and people are starting to follow him,
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.960]   and the scribes who are very educated,
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.360]   who knew the law more than anybody else,
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.640]   came to Jesus and said, "We wanna follow you."
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.600]   But Jesus, knowing exactly where their heart is,
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.520]   says to them, Jesus said to him,
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.760]   "The foxes have holes, birds of the air have nests,
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.320]   "but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.000]   In other words, you're coming to me to seek glory.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.600]   But the Son of Man is homeless.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.720]   You're coming because you think that if you hang out
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.360]   with the Messiah, that somehow some of that glory
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.200]   is gonna come to you, just like the disciples.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.520]   As he's prophesying he's gonna go to the cross,
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.920]   can we sit to the left or to the right?
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.560]   And he says, "I'm going to the cross, I'm gonna die."
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.840]   And he's told his disciples, "If you wanna follow me,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.800]   "you deny yourself, empty yourself, humble yourself,
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.520]   "and pick up your cross and follow me as well."
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.760]   Think about the beatitudes.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.720]   When Jesus begins to speak about the kingdom of God,
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.400]   and he begins by explaining that the kingdom of God
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.760]   is completely different than the kingdom
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.440]   that you're used to in this world.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.520]   What do we consider to be blessed?
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.640]   Blessed are the poor.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.760]   I mean, how often do we say we're blessed
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.520]   because God gave us a good job?
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.840]   How blessed are we because we got a raise?
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.600]   Where we're able to find and be able to pay our bill?
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.080]   We're so blessed, but Jesus says, "Blessed are the poor."
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.840]   If you were sad and God answers your prayers
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.880]   and we're rejoicing, he says, "No, blessed are those
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.280]   "who mourn, blessed are those who are gentle,
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.720]   "blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness."
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:19.480]   Know how often we think of like establishing righteousness
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   because we do quiet time, we're so disciplined,
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.200]   and we read scripture and we're evangelizing.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:28.840]   And sometimes when we are good at spiritual things,
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.960]   say we're blessed.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.680]   He says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst."
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.600]   Sometimes those who are the most broken
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.000]   are hungering and thirsting.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Those who recognize their own sins,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.360]   those who have gone through trouble
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.560]   and fell into sin and in need of repentance sometimes.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.600]   He says, "Those who are hungering and thirsty."
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:56.600]   Sometimes, and I confess, being a leader is hard
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:01.080]   because when you're a leader, you have to teach.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:05.440]   And everywhere we go, every person I meet, I have to teach.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.560]   So one of the downfalls of being a leader
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.280]   is you stop becoming a student for a while.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.840]   You become a teacher.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.520]   And I see a lot of people fall into this temptation
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.680]   that as soon as you become a leader,
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.000]   you have this mindset of like,
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.160]   I gotta have all the answers.
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.760]   He says, "No, you're not blessed because you know
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.000]   "or you have a degree or you've been around for a long time
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.160]   "or you have all these experiences."
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.160]   He says, "Blessed are you because you hunger
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.120]   "and thirst for righteousness."
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.640]   Think about who hungers and thirsts for righteousness.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.800]   Usually it's new Christians, brand new Christians.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.440]   "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.520]   "Blessed are those who are merciful."
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:49.440]   Not those who conquer and are able to defeat every argument,
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.720]   but he said those who are merciful,
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.960]   those who are pure in heart, those who are peacemakers.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.560]   We think about our current situation.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.520]   We said India, the persecution meter is rising rapidly.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.360]   In North Korea, you can't even own a Bible.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.800]   That could cause you to have death sentence.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.000]   There's certain part of Middle East,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.840]   just for gathering like this.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.560]   There's a possibility that you may be blown up.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.720]   Here it says, "Blessed are those who are persecuted."
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.880]   We think of blessing as because we live
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.240]   in a free country, nice air conditioned room
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.760]   and park your cars and we have these buildings.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.080]   We're so blessed.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:29.120]   But Jesus says, "Blessed are those who are persecuted.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.000]   "Blessed are you when you are insulted."
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.860]   Now why are they all blessed?
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.600]   If you know the Beatitudes, every one of these things,
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:41.000]   he said they're blessed because it's a doorway to Christ.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.280]   Every single one of them.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.160]   Every single one, whatever brings you closer,
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.120]   whatever causes you to be broken
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:52.200]   and bring you closer to Christ is the blessing
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.600]   from God's perspective.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.200]   Matthew chapter 18, one through four,
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   it says, "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.540]   "and said, 'Who then is the greatest
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:02.720]   "'in the kingdom of heaven?'
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.900]   "And he called the child to himself
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.720]   "and said to him before them and said,
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.280]   "'Truly I say to you, unless you are converted
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.240]   "'and become like children, you will not enter
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.120]   "'the kingdom of heaven.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.200]   "'Whoever then humbles himself as this child,
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.640]   "'he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.'"
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.880]   You know, I've heard some people say
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.840]   that what Jesus was saying here is don't ask questions.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.960]   Like a child.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:27.360]   So if Jesus says jump, you just jump, like a child.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.640]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.760]   He's saying this because they're coming
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.720]   and asking this question, who's the greatest?
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.400]   So he's pointing to a child who has no power,
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.600]   no authority, no honor.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.160]   He has nothing, he can't own property.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:45.660]   And he's talking to the lowliest, humblest person
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.840]   that he can think of and he says,
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.680]   "Unless you become like him,
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.980]   "you cannot understand the kingdom of heaven."
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:57.200]   How much of our life is a pursuit of the next stage?
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:01.140]   When we plant the church, when we get educated,
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:05.080]   get a job, our relationship, how much of our pursuit
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:09.120]   is somehow getting to the next stage of glory?
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.840]   Even in the church, in the name of Christ,
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.280]   how much of it is so that we can get
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.840]   to the next stage of glory?
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.240]   In James chapter one, 14 to 15, it says,
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.280]   "But each one is tempted when he is carried away,
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.520]   "enticed by his own lust.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.900]   "Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin,
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:31.120]   "and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death."
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.800]   You know, when we think of lust,
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:36.600]   we automatically think sexual lust, which is part of that.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.640]   But the word lust simply means great passion.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.240]   Great passion.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.020]   Sexual lust is not the only lust.
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.080]   What about the passion?
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.560]   What about this desire to make it in life?
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.360]   What if this desire, you go to someone's house,
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.620]   it's like, "Well, I wanna live in that house."
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:56.240]   How much of our anger and how much of our fighting
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:00.240]   is because our desires, our strong desires,
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.760]   somebody gets in the way?
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:05.260]   Our pride is the source of the conflict
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.780]   among our friendship, in our marriages,
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:12.000]   our relationships, and even with our children.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.900]   Pride is the reason, oftentimes, why churches break up,
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:21.520]   why we fight with our neighbors, why even wars begin.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:28.960]   Pride is the source and the underlying factor
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.160]   that identifies a rebellious man.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.980]   Wanting to touch some of that glory,
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.380]   wanting to have what God has, maybe in different degrees.
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:43.580]   And the whole world is in pursuit, and you know it.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.420]   I know it.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.340]   Because the moment that we are born,
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.100]   the question is, what is he going to be?
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:53.940]   And we have, in Korea, we have this (speaks in foreign language)
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.560]   Right, some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.160]   You've been to one of those parties
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.320]   and you grab what he's going to be,
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.940]   and it's usually his doctor, it's a scholar,
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.460]   he's gonna be a businessman.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.700]   I've never seen anybody put trashcan in there.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.580]   That he throws up and he grabs the trash.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:16.580]   Because, like all of us, we are expecting
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.220]   that our children are gonna become something great.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.060]   And so all our pursuit is pursuing
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.540]   what we may have had in our mind,
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.560]   now we're hoping that our children will fulfill,
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.140]   but how much of our natural pursuit of our glory
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:35.060]   and glory for our children is killing us?
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:41.120]   This is not by accident that the Son of God
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:44.920]   came in the lowliest of possible situation.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.120]   These are not just random facts.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:51.600]   God is demonstrating to us, and he says,
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.260]   "If you want to live," what does he say?
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:54.220]   "Die."
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:58.680]   "He who finds his life in me will find it."
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:04.080]   See, because the Jews and the people at that time
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.360]   could not understand this, they said,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.280]   "Why would the King of Kings, who's going to establish us
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.840]   "and bring eternal peace and conquer all our enemies,
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.440]   "why would he go to the cross?"
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.840]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.760]   Even the disciples didn't understand,
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.440]   even as he was making it very plain.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.280]   They said, "That doesn't make sense.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.900]   "Maybe we just didn't understand.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.080]   "I know he said he was going to die and be crucified,
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.200]   "but maybe we just don't understand."
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:29.120]   How much of our frustration in our walk with God
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.740]   is because we don't understand?
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:34.480]   How much of our frustration if God's not answering
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.800]   our prayers is because we don't understand?
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.360]   That where God wants to lead us
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.620]   is the exact opposite of our pursuit?
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.640]   That we've created in our mind that being blessed
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.360]   means this, this, this, and this, even in the church,
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.920]   even with our children.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:55.580]   But here's a thing that I think is important
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:00.260]   for us not to miss, because when we think of Christ,
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.560]   it's like he's humble, right?
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.040]   In fact, we would say that he's not just humble,
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.920]   he's humiliated, right?
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.560]   If you follow me, not only do you have to humble yourself,
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.280]   you must be willing to be humiliated.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.120]   But understand, he's not just calling us to be humble,
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.520]   to empty ourselves, become nothing.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.800]   There's a reason for that.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   Jesus did what he did in order to seek and save the lost.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.320]   In fact, if you see his exalted state, right,
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.520]   in the book of Revelation, or whenever you see prophecy
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.000]   of Christ in his throne, he's not in a humbled state,
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.040]   he's not on his knees, he's glorified.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.320]   He's sitting at the right hand of God.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.240]   And all of Israel, all of mankind
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.880]   are bowed down worshiping him.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.200]   In fact, Philippians chapter two ends with that.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.640]   Because he humbled himself, God exalted him
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.480]   to be a name above every name, every knee shall bow,
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.320]   every tongue confess that Christ is Lord.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.680]   So that's, his humbled state was during the period
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.560]   when he was here, specifically for the purpose
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.960]   of saving the lost.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.760]   In Mark chapter 10, 45, it says,
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.280]   "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.480]   "but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.320]   He humbled himself and became nothing.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:21.320]   To save us, to walk in our shoes,
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:24.120]   to go where we were at, so that he can be
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.640]   a sympathetic high priest.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:30.440]   He experienced the manger, the shepherds,
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.280]   the chaos, being born in this young family,
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.600]   maybe losing his father at early age,
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:40.800]   suffering the things that sinful mankind experiences,
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:44.520]   all for the purpose of saving us.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.080]   Luke 19, 10, "For the Son of Man has come to seek
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.720]   "and save that which was lost."
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.200]   And Jesus told his disciples that you must do the same.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.880]   Apostle Paul says the same thing
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.080]   in First Corinthians 9, 19 to 23.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.440]   He says, "For though I am free from all men,
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.800]   "I have made myself a slave to all."
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.880]   At that time, in any period of time,
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.320]   who aspires to be a slave?
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.660]   Apostle Paul was a Roman citizen.
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:19.440]   He was more privileged than an average Jew.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.200]   He was a Pharisee among Pharisees,
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.140]   possibly already sat in the Sanhedrin.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.840]   The guy who discipled him was Gamaliel,
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.240]   already famous, the top scholar of Israel.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.280]   And he says he's a free man
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.640]   who can travel anywhere he wants.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.200]   He has all the money and family prestige.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.600]   And he says, "Though I am free,
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.480]   "I have made myself a slave to all,
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:42.740]   "so that I may win more."
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:46.520]   He emptied himself and stepped in his shoe
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.400]   and took on what a slave would have to do
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.000]   in order to save them.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.320]   To the Jews, I became as a Jew,
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.800]   so that I might win the Jews.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.740]   To those who are under the law, as under the law,
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:59.000]   though not being myself under the law,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.660]   so that I might win those who are under the law.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.460]   Imagine Apostle Paul lived all his life
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:06.660]   trying to live perfectly under the law.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:11.500]   And imagine the kind of life a Pharisee had to live
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.660]   in order to be considered a perfect Jew.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.660]   And Apostle Paul was on the top of that,
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.620]   and then meeting Christ and realizing
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.220]   all of that had been freed.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.220]   The sting of death is sin,
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.980]   and the power of sin is the law,
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.140]   but we have been separated.
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.240]   We have been delivered and covered,
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.820]   so we're no longer under the law.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.080]   So can you imagine the freedom that they felt
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:36.100]   living under this oppression of the law and being freed?
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:40.500]   And yet, Paul says, he puts himself right back
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.060]   to live under the law, to save those who are under the law.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.420]   Turn 21, to those who are without the law,
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:51.420]   as without the law, though not being without the law of God,
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.660]   but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.220]   who are without the law.
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:59.100]   He was called as an apostle to the Gentiles,
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.140]   and you remember how much Paul hated the Gentiles.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.740]   They were unclean people.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.180]   A good Jew wouldn't even step into Samaritan
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.460]   because they considered themselves to be unclean.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.020]   And so if you look at the New Testament,
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.260]   so much of the language is trying to bring the Gentiles
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:17.460]   and the Jews to be able to worship together.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.620]   And yet, Apostle Paul says, to those without the law,
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.060]   I became without the law.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.740]   To the weak, I became weak, that I might win the weak.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.860]   I have become all things to all men,
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.660]   so that I might be all means, save some.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.420]   I do all things for the sake of the gospel,
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.760]   so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:41.500]   You cannot love, truly love, without emptying yourself.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.420]   It's not possible.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:48.740]   Let me ask you a question.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.420]   If there was a job description that said,
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:55.300]   your job is to wipe people's butts, right?
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.180]   Would you sign up?
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.940]   Some of you have already signed up, 'cause you're nurses.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.780]   Whether you like it or not, it comes with the job,
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.020]   but if somebody said, you can be a nurse
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.900]   without wiping butts, I'm sure most of you would sign up.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.820]   You do it, I think it's a very honorable profession,
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:16.140]   but it's a dirty job, and you do it, right?
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:19.000]   And more power to you.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.060]   But if you had an option not to wipe butts, right?
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.100]   Give needles and take care of them, do all this stuff,
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.300]   I'm sure you would easily volunteer,
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:30.160]   it's like, yeah, that one thing will hire somebody else.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.340]   What if the job description says,
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.740]   you got to wipe butts with no pay?
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.820]   Who would sign up?
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:47.900]   In fact, not only will people sign up,
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.640]   many of you have already signed up.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:57.920]   Every parent has wiped butts for years.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.880]   There are people in our church who are praying
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.420]   to wipe butts, that they get an opportunity
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.720]   to wipe some butts.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.060]   And you're doing it happily, voluntarily,
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.320]   and it brings joy to your life.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.160]   Why do you do that?
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.560]   Because you love that child.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.380]   Every single one of you had your butts wiped.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.700]   And every single parent has wiped butts.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:22.640]   Why do you do that?
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.960]   Because you love them.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.360]   I know some people, they gag at their own poo.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.100]   And it was like, well, how are they gonna have kids?
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.340]   I ain't gonna change diapers.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:38.040]   But they adjust, because it's their own kid,
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.180]   because they love them.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:44.220]   The Bible says, God so loved the world,
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.840]   that he gave his only begotten son.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.040]   Every step of redemptive history,
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.840]   every step of Jesus' journey to do what he did,
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.600]   was not just humbling, it was humiliating.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:04.120]   And the only reason that you and I can possibly fathom
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.160]   is his love.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.960]   Now that's the mystery.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.560]   Hell is not a mystery.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:14.440]   Every single one of us would create hell for the Nazis.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.600]   Every single one of us would create hell.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.560]   We just don't know who to put in there.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.760]   That's not the mystery.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.600]   The mystery is why would the son of the most high God
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:31.520]   put himself to be humiliated to save us.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:37.280]   You know, those of you who have children,
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.460]   you know, you're raising your kids,
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:41.440]   and because of your love,
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.040]   you're gonna be challenged one day,
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.680]   to different degrees, you know.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.820]   Those teenage years come around,
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:52.760]   and you hold on to your pride,
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.000]   you're not gonna make it.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.740]   God's gonna humble you.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:58.860]   He's gonna humble you.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.640]   Everything that you held, how dare he,
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.600]   how can he say, after all I've done,
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.640]   after everything I've done,
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.800]   after the sacrifice I've made,
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.880]   how can he possibly say this?
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.920]   And everything in your flesh wants to,
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.080]   get the heck out of my house.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.120]   But the love of Christ, love for your child,
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.840]   will compel you to humble yourself,
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.940]   for their sake.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.680]   And that's exactly what Paul says
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.120]   in 2 Corinthians 5, 14,
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.520]   for the love of Christ controls us,
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.680]   in the NIV it says it compels us,
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.760]   having concluded that one died for all,
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.120]   therefore all died.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.840]   You know what context Paul is saying this?
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.680]   This is a church that Paul loved dearly.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.520]   He came and he sacrificed,
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.120]   he came to the city, burnt out,
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.480]   being beaten, stoned, put into prison,
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.560]   and then Jesus himself,
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.760]   I have many disciples here,
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.200]   you continue to preach,
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.480]   he labors there for a year and a half,
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.120]   he loves this church,
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.680]   but the church started going off,
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.520]   getting divided, all chaos coming in,
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.180]   so Paul had to write this very difficult letter
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.840]   in 1 Corinthians,
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.240]   and their response in many of them was not good.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.240]   Who the heck is this guy?
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.960]   Telling us, shall I come to you with a whip?
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.320]   He said, maybe this guy's not an apostle,
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.440]   they were questioning his apostles,
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.940]   so he writes a second letter,
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.560]   defending his apostleship.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.640]   And he's struggling to love them,
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.080]   and to rebuke them at the same time,
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.040]   humanly speaking,
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.000]   just shake off the dust,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.200]   just move on, there's so many other places.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.000]   Just move on.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.940]   In fact, the thorn on his side,
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:38.420]   in my opinion, most likely was his detractors.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.380]   Who is this guy?
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.980]   But Jesus says, in order to humble him,
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.340]   because so much was coming through him,
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.180]   in order to keep him humble,
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:48.000]   God allowed the thorn on his side to continue,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.860]   because once pride started coming,
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.060]   it will ruin him.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.440]   And so Paul is writing this in this context
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.660]   of probably wanting to wrap it up,
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.060]   move on, shake off the dust,
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.760]   and why is he writing this letter?
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:08.460]   He says, for the love of Christ controls us,
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.460]   having concluded this, that one died for all,
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.500]   they were all died,
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.160]   because Christ did that for me,
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.300]   because Christ did that for you.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.660]   That's why we persevere.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.540]   That's why we humble ourselves.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.040]   And that's why we continue.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.180]   Sanctification is not becoming more.
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.940]   Sanctification is becoming less.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.160]   Becoming less.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.720]   So that as we become closer and closer to Christ,
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.600]   that we can have the same attitude
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.900]   that John the Baptist had.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:47.580]   That I must decrease, so he must increase.
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.520]   None of this is by accident.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.080]   Every part of his birth story is to remind us,
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.360]   follow Christ in his humility.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.760]   Glory will come one day when he comes,
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.580]   but until then, for the sake of the lost,
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.180]   clothe yourself with Christ.
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.660]   That we may go where he goes.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.420]   Uncomfortable places.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.500]   People we would not naturally love.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.820]   Say things that we would not naturally say,
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.720]   that have consequences.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.460]   But we would get out of ourselves,
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.460]   humble ourselves, as Christ came to us,
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.700]   that we would go to them.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.540]   Let's pray.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:35.040]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.300]   You know our struggle with our flesh.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:44.080]   How much we struggle to compete, to compare.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.120]   And ultimately creating conflicts.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:54.400]   Lord, teach us what it means to deny ourselves.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.060]   And pick up our own cross and follow you as well.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.720]   Lord, we thank you for your love,
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.680]   your humility, your humiliation.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:13.400]   That we also may have life abundantly in you.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:14.780]   May your name be exalted.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.120]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.220]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
