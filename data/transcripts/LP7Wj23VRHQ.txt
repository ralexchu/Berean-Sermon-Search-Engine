[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:21.580]   - All right, good morning.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.580]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.580]   Let me make a few announcements before we get started.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.580]   First of all, on April 30th, we have a welcome lunch.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.580]   And this is for people who are coming into the church
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.580]   who have questions about how the church functions
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.580]   and what are some philosophies of the ministry,
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.580]   who are the leaders, schedules, and that kind of stuff.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.580]   So if you are interested in attending the lunch,
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.580]   it's happening on April 30th at 1 p.m. in the other building,
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.580]   not in the cafeteria, but on the other side, okay?
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.580]   The cafe, but on the other side.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.580]   So let the welcome team know
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.580]   so that they can prepare the food for that.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.580]   And this is happening on April 30th.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.580]   Family ministry is having a roll and stroll Saturday
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.580]   on April 29th at 9 a.m.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.580]   So this is basically not for the Jubilee 50 and over,
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.580]   and it's not for the FAM 245.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.580]   You're welcome to join FAM 245,
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.580]   but it's again a gear for the rest of you,
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.580]   which is probably about 70, 80% of the family ministry.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.580]   And they're getting together on Saturday from 10 to 12,
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.580]   just kind of fellowshipping together,
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.580]   strolling at Open Space Trail.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.580]   Okay, I think that's what that's called.
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.580]   Okay, so if you want to sign up for that,
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.580]   you can come out, and they're going to be holding that event
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   on that Saturday, April 29th.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.580]   Softball tournament, May 20th.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.580]   So if you want to play softball and you haven't signed up,
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.580]   please sign up for that.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.580]   I read that the practice is going to start today.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.580]   Is that true?
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.580]   Anybody can confirm?
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.580]   Yes?
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.580]   Where is it happening?
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.580]   Bill Barber Park at 2 p.m., right?
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.580]   And is this ladies and the men?
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.580]   Okay, should have figured all that out before I came up here.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.580]   All right.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.580]   But anyway, so that's happening at 2 o'clock,
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.580]   and just grab your gear and just come out,
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.580]   and they'll probably put you into different teams, right?
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.580]   Okay, so come out for that.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.580]   The fundraiser for that is going to be going to support
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.580]   the first Korean mission trip that we're having this summer.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.580]   We have a team of about 20 people who are coming out
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.580]   or participating in that.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.580]   It's a little bit longer trip than we normally would do,
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.580]   mission trips, because it is our first year going
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.580]   and breaking ground, and so it's going to take a little bit more work.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:45.580]   So fundraisers are happening.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.580]   Okay, we'll let you know more about that.
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.580]   And then all church retreat that's happening on August 11th
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.580]   through 13th, that's Friday through Sunday,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.580]   early registration is closing on April 30th.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.580]   So you have about two or three more weeks,
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.580]   and then after that it's going to be regular registration,
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.580]   and then after that there will be late registration.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.580]   So if you are planning to come, you need to not only add your name,
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.580]   but you also need to pay the funds.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.580]   So if you--for whatever reason you can't go, you know,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.580]   and if it's close enough we can get the refund,
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.580]   we'll give you the refund, but we do need you to register early as possible,
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:24.580]   and that's early registration is closing at 430--not 430, 4-30, okay,
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.580]   end of the month, and so after that the registration fee is going to start going up.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.580]   Next Sunday we have a members meeting, our quarterly members meeting.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.580]   We have actually quite a few people to present to the church.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.580]   So that's happening at 1:30, but along with that,
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.580]   our career mission team is going to be doing a fundraiser with homemade chili.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.580]   This is not canned made chili, but homemade chili.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.580]   So people are actually making the chili,
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.580]   and then we're going to give you a hot dog to put it on, okay?
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.580]   We're actually selling hot dogs.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.580]   But there's going to be homemade chili, there's going to be other--sauerkraut
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.580]   and all this other stuff that's going to be happening.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.580]   So we encourage you to stay.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.580]   Even if you don't like hot dogs, eat the buns, eat something else.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.580]   So it is a fundraiser.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.580]   It is going to be $10.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.580]   I know what you're thinking, I can get that at $1.50 at Costco,
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:23.580]   but it will be going to missions here.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.580]   So if you love Jesus--
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.580]   Anyway, we're just asking you to support the team.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.580]   So bring your money and give us your money.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.580]   So that's going to be happening after second service next week.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.580]   Oh, actually, even after the first service, there will be hot dogs.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:46.580]   And again, they told me to emphasize homemade chili.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.580]   So after service, it's going to be given to you in a container,
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.580]   so if you can't eat it here, you can take that with you.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.580]   But that's happening next week, so please help us out with that.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.580]   And then afterwards, our members meeting will be happening at 1.30.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.580]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.580]   And then again, if you are visiting us or if you brought physical offering,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.580]   there's a box in the back as you're leaving.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.580]   But for the rest of us, we'll give you a minute for you to give your electronic offering.
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:17.580]   Let me pray for us.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:23.580]   Gracious Father, we thank you for the blessing of being able to come and worship you.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:29.580]   Lord, we know what a privilege it is to be able to come to the throne of grace
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.580]   with confidence to seek help in time of need.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.580]   Help us, Lord God, to see through all the clutter in our lives,
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.580]   that we may see you causing us to stand,
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.580]   that your grace is what sustains us.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.580]   Help us, Lord God, this morning to fix our eyes, our heart, our mind,
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:54.580]   all of it, Lord God, upon Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.580]   I pray that even in this giving, help us to give it intentionally as an act of worship,
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.580]   and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for your kingdom.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.580]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:49.580]   Church family, let's all stand together.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.580]   I just want to encourage you that we come here week to week,
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:57.580]   and sometimes we bring what's on our mind into this room,
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.580]   but I want to encourage us that we come before God who is awesome.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.580]   He's worthy to be praised.
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.580]   I'm going to sing this first song. It's namely "Awesome is the Lord."
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.580]   [music]
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:26.580]   Great are you, Lord, mighty in strength.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:33.580]   You are faithful and you will ever be.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:40.580]   We will praise you on the vartays.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.580]   For your glory we offer everything.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:52.580]   Raise your hands, all you nations, shout to God of creation.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.580]   How awesome is the Lord most high.
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.580]   Sing it out, where you send us.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:07.580]   Where you send us, God, we will go.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:14.580]   You're the answer we want the world to know.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:21.580]   We will trust you when you call our name.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:26.580]   Where you lead us, we'll follow all the way.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:33.580]   Raise your hands, all you nations, shout to God of creation.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.580]   How awesome is the Lord most high.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.580]   We will praise you, we will praise you together.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:51.580]   For now and forever, how awesome is the Lord most high.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.580]   Hallelujah.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.580]   Hallelujah.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.580]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:05.580]   How awesome is the Lord most high.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.580]   One more time, hallelujah.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.580]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.580]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:21.580]   How awesome is the Lord most high.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:28.580]   Raise your hands, all you nations, shout to God of creation.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.580]   How awesome is the Lord most high.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.580]   We will praise you.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.580]   We will praise you together.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:45.580]   For now and forever, how awesome is the Lord most high.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.580]   Sing it out.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.580]   How awesome is the Lord most high.

[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.580]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 5.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.580]   We're going to be reading from verse 17 through verse 26.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.580]   Luke chapter 5, verse 17 through 26.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.580]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.580]   "One day he was teaching, and there were some Pharisees
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.580]   and teachers of the law sitting there,
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.580]   who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.580]   and from Jerusalem, and performed healing.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.580]   And some men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed,
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.580]   and they were trying to bring him in
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.580]   and to set him down in front of him.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.580]   But not finding any way to bring him in because of the crowd,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.580]   they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.580]   with his stretcher into the middle of the crowd
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.580]   in front of Jesus.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.580]   Seeing their faith, he said, 'Friend, your sins are forgiven.'
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.580]   The scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying,
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.580]   'Who is this man who speaks blasphemies, who can forgive sins but God alone?'
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.580]   But Jesus, aware of their reasoning, answered and said to them,
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.580]   'Why are you reasoning in your hearts?
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.580]   Which is easier, to say, "Your sins have been forgiven,"
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.580]   forgiving you, or to say, "Get up and walk?"
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.580]   But so that you may know that the Son of Man
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.580]   has authority on earth to forgive sins,
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.580]   he said to the paralytic, 'I say to you, get up
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.580]   and pick up your stretcher and go home.'
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.580]   Immediately he got up before them and picked up
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.580]   what he had been lying on and went home glorifying God.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.580]   They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God,
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.580]   and they were filled with fear, saying,
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.580]   'We have seen remarkable things today.'"
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.580]   Let's pray.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:25.580]   Lord, we pray that your word would be open to us,
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.580]   help us to hear from you.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.580]   I pray that you would protect my mouth, this pulpit, Lord God,
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.580]   from speaking any falsehood.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.580]   We pray that your truth and your truth alone will go forth,
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.580]   that your sheep may hear your voice and follow you alone.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.580]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.580]   I think many of you guys know we are in wedding season,
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.580]   and so we just had a wedding yesterday.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.580]   There's another wedding coming next week,
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.580]   and then we're getting so busy with weddings
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.580]   that they're starting to double up.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.580]   We have maybe sometimes a couple weddings
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.580]   at the same time on the same day.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.580]   I'm not sure exactly what the number is,
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.580]   but I've heard that there's about 17, 18 weddings
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.580]   lined up from here to August or October.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.580]   And so there's a lot of weddings that are happening.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.580]   I mean, our church always had a lot of weddings,
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.580]   but we're kind of in hyperspace now.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.580]   You know, anytime we have weddings,
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.580]   you know, obviously those of you who've been married recently,
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.580]   there's so much going on, right, in the preparation.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.580]   And again, my personal opinion is I don't think there's
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.580]   anything that you do in life that requires as much attention.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.580]   And I know when you have your first child,
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.580]   there's a lot of work that goes in,
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.580]   but by the time the child comes, especially for the men,
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.580]   you're not really doing anything, right?
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.580]   We're waiting. We're doing support work, right?
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.580]   But during the wedding, I mean, you have to prepare for the food,
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.580]   you have to find the venue, the flowers,
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.580]   you have the guest list, and you have to get the reception.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.580]   And in the midst of all of that, you're getting married, right?
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.580]   And then you have to get your apartment ready,
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.580]   you have to get the in-laws and people coming into town.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.580]   There's so much that you have to do that if we're not careful,
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.580]   we can get sucked up into the preparation
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.580]   of the wedding ceremony,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.580]   and then you miss the whole point of this, right?
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.580]   And so if I were to ask you,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.580]   all the things that you need to do,
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.580]   all the things that require your attention,
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.580]   what is the most important thing that needs to be done for the wedding?
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.580]   And don't answer me, just kind of think to yourself,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.580]   what would you say?
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.580]   Maybe some of you say, well, venue.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.580]   You have to find the venue because that's hard, right?
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.580]   And that's going to kind of set the tone of the mood of the thing.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.580]   Maybe the officiant,
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.580]   maybe somebody who's going to lead you well.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.580]   Pictures.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.580]   Everything else you might forget, but the pictures is going to be a lifetime.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.580]   Or you might say it's the food.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.580]   Most of the guests may say it's the food.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.580]   The food is what they remember,
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.580]   so you have to make sure that you have the right food.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.580]   So you may have different opinions on all this,
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.580]   but I think you will agree with me,
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:07.580]   there's one glaring thing that is at the center of all of that.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.580]   And the answer is your marriage, right?
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.580]   You can do all of that,
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:20.580]   and if you didn't properly prepare to get you to start a marriage
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.580]   that isn't going to honor God, right?
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.580]   You missed the whole point.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.580]   It doesn't matter how beautiful it is,
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.580]   and you have the best flowers and the venue.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.580]   You can have all of that beautiful,
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.580]   and then you missed the whole point because it didn't actually prepare you
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.580]   for what you're doing that day,
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.580]   for marriage ceremony, right?
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.580]   Sometimes I've seen couples who get so caught up
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.580]   in making the wedding as beautiful as possible and so stressed out,
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.580]   and they're like so tense with each other
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.580]   that the wife is--or fiance at that time--
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.580]   is frustrated because he's not as engaged and asked questions.
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.580]   He thinks he's being helpful by saying, "Well, I don't really care.
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.580]   You just do whatever you want. I'll support you."
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.580]   And then she's angered by that because, "Well, you should care.
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.580]   Why don't you care?"
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.580]   And they get into all this conflict, and then they hold it in, hold it in
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.580]   because they don't want to ruin their wedding day.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.580]   And then when the wedding day is over and they get to their honeymoon,
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.580]   they have the biggest fight that they've ever had on their honeymoon.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.580]   And so I've had to counsel people after they come back from their honeymoon
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.580]   and to kind of help them to reconcile because the whole honeymoon,
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.580]   they were angry with each other.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.580]   So sometimes the way that we have weddings,
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.580]   that we focus on these external things to the extent
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.580]   that sometimes you miss the whole point of why this wedding is happening
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.580]   to begin with.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.580]   I say all of this because even as Christians, we can spend all our lives
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.580]   decorating our Christian faith with what we do at church
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.580]   and what's right, what's wrong, studying,
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.580]   and you miss the whole point of why Christ came.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.580]   The story that we're looking at really gets to the point,
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.580]   and Jesus publicly declares--it's not the first time--
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:14.580]   but He wants people to clearly understand why He's here, what He's doing.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.580]   That in the midst of all the healing and the popularity growing
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.580]   and people are coming to Him because they want to have sight,
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.580]   and He cuts through all of that, and it's very deliberate
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.580]   why Luke presents it to us the way he presents it.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.580]   So this morning I'm going to divide it into three parts.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.580]   One is the audience. Who's there?
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.580]   Two, the miracle itself, and what's happening there.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:42.580]   And then third, the response, the response of the Pharisees,
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.580]   the response of the healed, the response of the crowd
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.580]   that participated in this.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.580]   As we follow this outline so we can better understand
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.580]   what the point of this story is.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.580]   Why is this story here about the paralytic that gets healed,
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.580]   and Jesus says, "Your sins are forgiven"?
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.580]   First of all, the crowd.
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.580]   All we know in the Gospel of Luke, it says there's a large crowd gathering,
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.580]   but Mark gives us a little bit more detail that gives us a background
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.580]   behind what's going on.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.580]   In Mark 2, 1-2, it says, "When he had come back from Capernaum,
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.580]   several days afterwards it was heard that he was at home."
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.580]   Stop right there.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.580]   So the room, the house that this is taking place is not just any center.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.580]   It was his home.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.580]   Now, was that Jesus' own home? Probably not.
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.580]   It just means that that's where they were stationed,
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:36.580]   this is where he was sleeping, and this is most likely Peter's home.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.580]   So when he says he was home, he was doing ministry,
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   and he came back to basically rest.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.580]   So it kind of gives us a background.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.580]   We talked about this in the beginning of ministry,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.580]   but already people were not leaving him alone.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:53.580]   He's home resting, and they have found him, and they're coming to him.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.580]   And when Jesus says in Luke 9-58, Jesus said to him,
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.580]   "The fox have holes, the birds of the air have nests,
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.580]   but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head,"
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.580]   he meant that literally.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.580]   They wouldn't leave him alone, even at home.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.580]   So they barged in. So he's forced into this situation.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.580]   So I need you to understand what's going on here.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.580]   Jesus was not out doing ministry.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.580]   This is happening everywhere he goes.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.580]   So you can understand why he was so tired.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.580]   You can understand why he was in the habit of breaking away
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:28.580]   and spending time with the Father, really to get some rest.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.580]   They hear that he's at home, and then in Luke 5-17 tells us what happened.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.580]   And there were some Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:41.580]   who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.580]   Now Luke goes out of his way to tell us that these Pharisees came
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.580]   from every village, from Judea, from Jerusalem.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.580]   Now the reason why this is significant is Luke is making sure that we understand
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.580]   that this was not just some regular crowd that wanted healing.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:01.580]   People came, like the leaders of Israel began to hear about this man.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.580]   And so they traveled all the way from Jerusalem.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.580]   Jerusalem is the epicenter of Israel's leadership.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:14.580]   And typically, if you wanted access to the leaders, you would have to travel there.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.580]   You don't have the leaders come to you.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.580]   You would have to go over there.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:24.580]   But Jesus' popularity, could he possibly be the Messiah?
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.580]   And the proof that he was giving with his miracles began to spread.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.580]   So he said, "Pharisees." It got their attention.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:36.580]   And so they were sitting. Most likely, they had the front row seats to this.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.580]   Now we're not looking at a room this size.
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:45.580]   Those of you who've been to India with us, the average size house of a middle class person
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:50.580]   would have been the center where we would do our medical camps.
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.580]   And it would fit maybe on the floor, not with chairs, but on the floor,
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.580]   maybe 50, 60, 70, 80 people, depending on the size.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:03.580]   Maybe about that size, maybe like 300, 400 square feet max.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.580]   So they're crowded in. The leaders of Israel come.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.580]   And this is being an Asian culture.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:14.580]   Most likely, they had the seats of honor, the best seats, wherever that was.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:21.580]   And it was in that context, it was in that context that this miracle takes place.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.580]   So let's look at the miracle.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:29.580]   Luke is going out of his way to tell us that this, like the leaders of Israel
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.580]   had heard about him, traveled all the way from Jerusalem to come and get an audience to see,
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.580]   "Is this guy really it? Who is this guy?"
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:43.580]   Let's look at the miracle. The miracle, Luke 5.17, it begins by telling us,
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.580]   "The power of the Lord was present for him to perform miracles."
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:52.580]   Now, if you just read that, not understanding the context,
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.580]   he's like, "Oh, yeah, the power was with him, and that's why he was able to perform miracles."
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.580]   Now, if that was said of anybody else who would say,
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.580]   "Oh, this is a man of God that God has anointed."
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.580]   But this is the Son of God.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.580]   That statement in and of itself is humbling.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.580]   Because He's God, He's the creator of the universe.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.580]   All things are made for Him, by Him.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.580]   He sustains all things, and yet the Bible says this miracle that He's going to perform
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.580]   is because God allowed it.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.580]   This is a statement of humility.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.580]   That even in this miracle, even in this great thing that He does,
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.580]   He humbled Himself to the point where He became a servant.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.580]   Where He needed God's anointing.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.580]   He needed the Holy Spirit's help.
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.580]   He says, "The paralytic."
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.580]   Clearly, it paints a picture of desperateness.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.580]   But I want you to understand, when He says He was a paralytic,
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.580]   it doesn't explain to us how He became a paralytic.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.580]   My guess is that this may have come from an injury.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.580]   It seems like they were very, very desperate to get Him healed.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.580]   That doesn't necessarily mean that He was injured,
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:05.580]   but I'm just kind of looking at that as maybe the desperateness came from the fact that He was injured.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:11.580]   And He became a paralytic, and that's why there was more of a sense of urgency to get Him healed.
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:17.580]   Now, the point that I really want you to understand in what's going on,
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:23.580]   is that here's a room, they're barred into His house, and people are crowded.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.580]   Now, we don't know if Jesus was healing other people, but again, those of you who went to India,
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.580]   you have a picture in your head because we've experienced it.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.580]   Why do we have our medical camp inside the room?
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.580]   We can't do it outside because it's just too many people bombarding.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.580]   Because they're desperate. They know that if we leave, they're not going to get the medical attention.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.580]   They're not going to get their eyes examined by the doctors.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:55.580]   We are the first foreigners in some of these villages that's been there for over 40 years.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:59.580]   So they know if we leave that they may not have another access to us.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.580]   So at some points, we may have hundreds of people outside really trying to get in,
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:08.580]   and we pass out numbers to try to make it orderly, but even with the numbers,
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.580]   because they're desperate, they want to be seen, so they're knocking it to the door.
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:16.580]   What I'm picturing in my head is they're bombarded in,
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:21.580]   and Jesus' fame has spread to the point that the leaders of Israel, right?
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:27.580]   So if Pharisees came from every village, and even from Jerusalem,
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.580]   my guess is that room was packed with Pharisees.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:36.580]   And if you weren't a leader, if you weren't a man of significance, or maybe of tremendous wealth,
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.580]   you probably weren't in that room.
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.580]   So an average person who came to Jesus to get healed was probably knocking outside,
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.580]   trying to get in, kind of like what we do, right?
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   When we go there, we have to have guys like standing at the door,
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.580]   making sure that they don't barge in.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.580]   So all day, we're fighting with the crowd to keep them back.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.580]   That's probably the scene that we're seeing here,
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:07.580]   and the disciples are probably outside protecting, probably, you know, this is Peter's home.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:15.580]   And in that context, this paralytic, four of his friends, according to the Gospel of Mark,
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.580]   they go up to the roof, and they start breaking the roof.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:25.580]   Now you have to understand, to break the roof, that's not like one that they open up the top and they drop them in.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.580]   A typical roof at that time had wood beams, logs,
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.580]   and then they had some sort of a leaf cover, and they put mud over it.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.580]   And that's what it was.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   So in order to break into that, it wasn't just something that they just kind of lifted up and they come in.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.580]   So it would take time.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.580]   So can you imagine being in that crowd?
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.580]   First of all, they're cutting line, right?
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.580]   Everybody else is in the door trying to get in,
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.580]   but they cut line because they found another route that they're going to go in.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.580]   So you can imagine everybody else looking at them is like, "What?"
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:02.580]   So how do you feel if you, even if you're at Disneyland and somebody cuts in front of you,
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.580]   something as frivolous as Disneyland, right?
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.580]   Or at Costco, somebody tries to cut in line, you feel bad.
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.580]   But imagine if you were trying to get medical attention, you're trying to get Jesus to heal you,
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.580]   and somebody cuts in line.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.580]   So imagine the crowd that's outside who's probably already angered with them,
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.580]   that they're cutting line, they're breaking this.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.580]   This is Peter's house.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.580]   This guy's breaking his house.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.580]   So they're sitting there, "Are these guys serious?"
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.580]   And my guess is, at the minimum, it's going to take at least five, six minutes,
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.580]   even if all four of them were chopping at it.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:37.580]   So there's like four or five minutes of dust coming down, dirt, mud, you know,
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.580]   like all this stuff coming down.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.580]   It's like, "Wow, this guy's doing this."
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.580]   Pharisees are offended because these guys are leaders.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:48.580]   They're used to being honored, and the roof is coming down on top of them, right?
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:53.580]   So you can imagine that in the middle of all of this, people are irritated.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.580]   "Who is this? Who are these?"
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.580]   So the picture that I have is typically to get to the roof,
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.580]   they would have a small, narrow staircase to get up there.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.580]   So they worked hard to get him up there.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:08.580]   So I would think that the disciples, the other crowds who are angry with them,
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.580]   are trying to get up there to stop them.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.580]   So they have other friends at that narrow case fighting them off, right?
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:19.580]   So finally, by the time he gets dropped in front of Jesus,
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.580]   what do you think the response would be?
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.580]   Like, "This guy cut line," right?
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.580]   He's like, "This is the honored guest, the Pharisees are sitting here.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:34.580]   This is Jesus, possibly the Messiah, and then he broke my house."
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:41.580]   Everybody was probably irritated and angry with the four friends and the paralytic.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.580]   Everybody except Jesus.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.580]   Jesus looks at him, and instead of saying, "What are you doing? Get in line."
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.580]   Everybody houses him, "You're not the only person who's sick."
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:57.580]   Instead, he looks at the effort that they made to break in, and he says,
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:02.580]   "Because of your faith, your sins have been forgiven."
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.580]   Now, why do you go through all that trouble?
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:10.580]   Why does God tell us to seek with all our heart?
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.580]   In Matthew 7-8, it says, "Ask, and it will be given to you.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.580]   Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.580]   For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.580]   And to him who knocks, it will be opened."
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.580]   Why does he make us seek, ask, and knock?
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:30.580]   Even about persistent prayer in Luke 18-1-3, he says not just to pray,
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.580]   but to be devoted to prayer, to persistently pray.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.580]   That even this wicked judge who could care less about this widow,
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.580]   because he badgered him, he gave in.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.580]   So he says to pray like that.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.580]   Not just to pray, but to pray with urgency.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:55.580]   In Jeremiah 29-13, "You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart."
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:00.580]   Not just seek him, not just ask, not just search, but he says with all your heart.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.580]   Why does he do that?
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:08.580]   Why can't we just seek him, but it has to be completely devoted?
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:13.580]   It tells us that even in the response, and even throughout Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.580]   the primary thing that God is looking for is faith.
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:20.580]   Is faith.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.580]   That even when we pray, he says you must pray in faith.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:28.580]   That in our search, in our devotion, in our sense of urgency,
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:33.580]   it reveals that we understand that he's our only hope.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:37.580]   That we understand that he's the only one who can answer my prayers.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.580]   That he's the only one that can heal.
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.580]   And so because they went through all of that, he instead of looking and saying,
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:49.580]   "Man, they cheated, they cut in line, they're irritated, the leaders are ticked off."
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:55.580]   He was encouraged by their faith.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:00.580]   The scripture clearly says in Acts 4-12, "There is salvation in no one else.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:07.580]   For there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:12.580]   Just like those, when we go to Indian villages and people are really wrestling,
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:16.580]   especially as the time goes by and they know that we're probably going to leave.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.580]   There's a sense of desperateness of trying to get through the door.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:24.580]   And trying to every crack, every possibility, every connection that they have
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:29.580]   to use that to get in because once we leave, we can't help them.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:37.580]   It's because they know and they believe that we have the doctors that are needed to help them.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:42.580]   Christ sees in their desperateness, in their cry, in what they were doing.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.580]   And he says, "It's because you believe."
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:54.580]   And then so he wants to reward them, but the reward that he gives them is that your sins are forgiven.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:46:00.580]   At the core of that, you can look at that after all that they have done, right?
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.580]   He says, "After all that, your sins are forgiven."
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:09.580]   What? We didn't go through all of that just so that you can say your sins are forgiven?
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.580]   We brought him down because we want him to be healed.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.580]   I want you to see the response.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:23.580]   And there's a very specific reason why Luke mentions and describes the Pharisees.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:27.580]   Luke chapter 5, 21-23, it says, "The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason."
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.580]   Again, they were thinking to themselves. This was not an emotional outburst.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.580]   This was not just like an angry outburst.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.580]   In fact, we're not even sure if they were arguing with Jesus.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.580]   It says they were reasoning in their head.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:45.580]   Who is this man who speaks blasphemies, who can forgive sins but God alone?
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.580]   Is that correct?
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:52.580]   100%. Their response was correct. That's why they were reasoning.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.580]   They were thinking about all the laws.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.580]   Think about what it took for a Jew to be forgiven of sins.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.580]   All that drama of the tabernacle.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:09.580]   All that drama of the whole offering, the grain offering, sin offering, guilt offering, the peace offering.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.580]   All the offerings that God told them and said, "You must follow these rules,
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:19.580]   that no one can touch these poles, and no one can touch the altar, and animals being slaughtered,
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.580]   and no one can enter into the Holy of Holies.
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:27.580]   You have the Day of Atonement, the whole drama every single year,
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:32.580]   and just a bloody mess at the tabernacle and at the temple.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:37.580]   They needed to do that every single year, repeat it over and over again,
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:43.580]   just so that they can have some kind of access to God with their sins forgiven.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   And then to have a man just stand there and say, "Your sins forgiven."
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:54.580]   So for a Pharisee who knows the law, the teachers of the law, who's been taught this,
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.580]   to make sure that they kept the law perfectly,
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:02.580]   and then a man shows up, impossibly, is he the Messiah? He's performing miracles,
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.580]   everybody's coming after him, and for him to say, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.580]   That breaks all of their system.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:13.580]   And so when they are offered their reasoning in their head, "That's blasphemy!"
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.580]   They're absolutely correct.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.580]   Unless he's God. Unless he's God.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.580]   And that's why Luke is mentioning their presence,
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.580]   because they knew exactly what Jesus was saying.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.580]   They just didn't believe him.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.580]   How can you mere man say that?
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.580]   Knowing their reasoning, Jesus responds and says, "Which is easier to say,
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:44.580]   'Your sins have been forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk.'"
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:49.580]   You see how offensive that is if Jesus wasn't God, if he didn't have the authority to say that?
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:53.580]   Imagine if you just went to a prison,
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.580]   and you have all these people who are in jail for murder, and they have life sentences,
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:01.580]   and you go and say, "Oh man, I feel compassionate for you. It must be hard in there."
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:05.580]   And you decide to open the gate.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:09.580]   The life sentence, you know what? You guys are all pardoned.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.580]   And you open the gate and just let everybody out, because you're compassionate,
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.580]   and you're gracious, and you're loving.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:21.580]   And so you open the door. Everybody, let's get out. What's going to happen?
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.580]   First of all, they're all going to be caught and put back into jail,
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:29.580]   and they're going to get extra time for breaking out of jail.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:34.580]   And the guy who opened the door, now he's going to be in prison, right?
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:38.580]   For aiding and abetting people that was not pardoned.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.580]   The only person that can come and do that is maybe the governor, maybe the president of the United States.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:46.580]   He had the authority to come and say, "Okay, I pardon all of you."
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:51.580]   But outside of the people who has authority to say, "You're pardoned,"
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.580]   is a criminal act.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.580]   And so the Pharisees, when they hear this, it's like,
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:04.580]   "What a good thing that they hear. How can you possibly say that?"
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:09.580]   Jesus was clearly saying that He is God.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.580]   And that's exactly what He came to do.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:18.580]   In fact, the Scripture tells us in John chapter 10, 31-33,
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:23.580]   "The Jews picked up stones to stone Him.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:28.580]   And Jesus answered them, 'I showed you many good works from the Father. For which of them are you stoning Me?'
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.580]   The Jews answered Him, 'For a good work we have not stoned you, but for blasphemy.
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:38.580]   And because you, being a man, make yourself out to be God.'"
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.580]   They knew.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:44.580]   From this point on, they knew exactly what Jesus was saying.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:48.580]   In order for you to have authority to forgive sin, you have to be God.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.580]   And because you're not God, this is blasphemy.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:55.580]   Even after they saw this miracle, no.
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.580]   I mean, you're a good man. Clearly you have powers.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:04.580]   How can you be a mere man and say that you're God?
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.580]   There is no middle ground.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:13.580]   Jesus can't possibly be a good man and forgive sins.
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:19.580]   If He was just a mere man, what authority did He have to pardon you of eternal judgment?
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.580]   What power? He'd be a crazy man. He'd be a guilty man.
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.580]   He'd be a lawbreaker Himself, deserving of judgment.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.580]   If He actually did not have authority to do that.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:33.580]   There is no middle ground.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:39.580]   In fact, every sin that we commit is ultimately a sin against God.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:46.580]   If you sin against Me, obviously it's up to Me to say, "Okay, you wronged Me, so I forgive you."
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:54.580]   But look what David says in Psalm 51, 3-4, when he confesses his sin of adultery and even murder.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:52:00.580]   He says, "For I know My transgressions, and My sin is ever before Me against you.
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:08.580]   You only I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are justified when you speak and blameless when you judge."
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:14.580]   Now that sounds unfair. He basically raped Bathsheba.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:18.580]   And then to cover up his sin, he murders.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:23.580]   He puts Uriah in a position where he knows he's going to get slaughtered, so he basically murders him.
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:29.580]   And then when he gets caught, and he confesses and he says, "To you and you only have I sinned."
[00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:33.580]   What does he mean by that? That sounds really offensive.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:37.580]   He's not saying that he didn't transgress against Bathsheba.
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.580]   He's not saying that there's no wrong done to Uriah.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:48.580]   He's saying in the large scheme of things, the great sin, the greatest sin is sin against God.
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:59.580]   Although he committed adultery with Bathsheba, and forced her to break that covenant between her and her husband,
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:06.580]   the greater sin is the covenant he broke with God, because it was God.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:12.580]   Even though he ended up taking the life of a loyal man, Uriah,
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:20.580]   and obviously he sins against him because he takes his life, but the greater sin is the life that belonged to God that he took,
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.580]   that didn't belong to him.
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:27.580]   Because that was his creation, that was his child that he took.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.580]   So in the large scheme of things, he's the king of Israel.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.580]   He's the guy who makes the law.
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.580]   Who's going to judge him?
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:39.580]   If he decides to take a wife, if he decides to take 10,000 wives, who's going to make him guilty?
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:46.580]   If he chooses to kill not only one, but 10,000 men, who's going to judge him?
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:52.580]   But standing before God, he recognizes that his sin is against God, first and foremost.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:56.580]   Every sin that you and I commit is a sin against God.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:01.580]   We may feel more guilty and sorrowful and sad that we harmed somebody else,
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:08.580]   but at the end of the day, the greater sin that we need to confess is a sin that we committed against God.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:14.580]   It's because we do not recognize sometimes the covenant between God and that we belong to him,
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:20.580]   that we feel more sorrowful about what we do to other people than we do with the covenant between God.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:28.580]   And that's why the only person that can forgive of any sin, ultimately, and to pardon us is God himself.
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:30.580]   And that's the statement that he's making.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:36.580]   In the midst of all the ministry, all the healing, all the feeding, even the raising of the dead,
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:43.580]   ultimately, was to bring sinners to repentance, to reconcile us to a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.580]   He didn't come to fix the economy. He didn't come to fix political problems.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.580]   He says it with his own words that he came to seek and save the lost.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:57.580]   The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:02.580]   In fact, Romans 8, 28 says, "We know that God causes all things to work together for good,
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:07.580]   to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose."
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.580]   All things.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:13.580]   To work together for good. What is the good that he's referring to?
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.580]   He causes all things to work together for good.
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.580]   Like all the trials, all the struggles that your business is going to do well.
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.580]   Is that what he means by good?
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.580]   Like everything in your life, ultimately, no matter how hard it is,
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:28.580]   eventually, you're going to find out that this was for good.
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.580]   That you're going to live a long life and your children are going to be taken care of.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:36.580]   You're going to be healthy, wealthy. Is that what he means by good?
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:41.580]   No. What he means by good is to bring us to repentance and our salvation,
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:45.580]   our justification, our sanctification, our glorification.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:52.580]   So everything he does, the end goal is not your physical healing.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:57.580]   The end goal of everything that God does is not your safety.
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:00.580]   It's not comfort for your children. It's not your retirement.
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.580]   It's not that your business is going to do.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:08.580]   The end goal of everything that he does is to forgive us of our sins.
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.580]   To bring us to repentance.
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:15.580]   So sometimes God may bless your life to bring you to repentance.
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:21.580]   Sometimes God may cause you and allow you to suffer to bring you to repentance.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:27.580]   Sometimes God will cause you to be in comfort so that you can use that for his glory.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:35.580]   Sometimes God will cause you to be in tears to bring you to repentance.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:47.580]   He brings all things. He works all things for the central purpose so that we can be married to Christ.
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:52.580]   In Isaiah 43, 25 says, "I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgression my own sake,
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.580]   and I will not remember your sins."
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:00.580]   Jeremiah 31, 34, "They will not teach again each man his neighbor and each man his brother,
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:04.580]   saying, 'Know the Lord, for they will know me.'
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.580]   From the least of them to the greatest of them declares the Lord,
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:11.580]   for I will forgive their iniquity and their sin I will remember no more."
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:16.580]   Why were they not able to see him?
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:18.580]   It says because of their sins.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.580]   Between the old covenant and the new covenant, the reason why they had to stay away in the old covenant
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:27.580]   is because Christ was not crucified.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.580]   And once the atonement was made,
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.580]   the reason why they have to have this relationship with him
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:40.580]   is because the barrier was not our ability, it was not our ingenuity.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:48.580]   People are not not saved because we didn't find a clever way to bring them to church.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:55.580]   People are not not saved because we didn't figure out the best marketing to get people in here.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.580]   The scripture says it's their sin.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.580]   It's a sin.
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.580]   That's why, again, in Micah 7, 18, it says,
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:09.580]   "Who is God like you who pardons iniquity and passes over the rebellious act to the remnant of his possession?
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:14.580]   He does not retain his anger forever because he delights in unchanging love."
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:18.580]   He delights to forgive sins.
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.580]   He's not hiding.
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.580]   He's not simply making us work hard,
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:27.580]   but ultimately everything he does is to bring us to repentance.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:30.580]   So when Jesus answers the skeptics, the reasoning,
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:33.580]   "This is blasphemy. Who can do this but God?"
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.580]   He says, "Which is easier?
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:41.580]   To say your sins are forgiven or to tell a paralytic to get up and walk?"
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.580]   Well, I could say your sins are forgiven. That's so easy.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:47.580]   I just said it. Your sins are forgiven.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.580]   Your sins are forgiven. Your sins are forgiven.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.580]   I can go and open up all the prisoners' doors. Everybody's forgiven.
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.580]   That was easy. Even I could do that.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:59:03.580]   I can tell any elementary student, any child who's three who can open his mouth, he can repeat those words.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.580]   On the surface, it looks like that's easy.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:12.580]   Now, I want you to—I hope you really understand this.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.580]   Those words are easy to say,
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:21.580]   but to have any authority to actually forgive sins
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:28.580]   required the Son of God to empty himself of his glory.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   If Jesus came as Caesar, we would have looked at that and said,
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:39.580]   "Why would the Son of God humble himself as a king of Rome
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:43.580]   and experience fatigue and hunger, bowel movement?
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:49.580]   Why would he humiliate himself becoming a human being, let alone a servant?"
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:54.580]   The Son of God had to come, be humiliated in human form,
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.580]   consider equality with God nothing to be grasped,
[00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.580]   and then he humbled himself to the point of death,
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:06.580]   the most humiliating, painful death that human beings have invented up to that point,
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.580]   to experience that.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.580]   But that was not the end.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.580]   The real suffering wasn't human suffering.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:19.580]   The real suffering was when his Father drew near him
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:26.580]   and placed the judgment that you and I, the elect of God, past, present, and future upon him,
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:31.580]   where the Son of God cries out, "Why have you forsaken me?"
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.580]   Imagine the suffering of this man.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:37.580]   He had to experience that and then be crucified,
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.580]   and then be buried, and the third day to rise in order for him to say,
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:45.580]   "Your sins are forgiven," and have any authority to do that.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.580]   But to say to the man, "Get up and walk," that's all he needed to do.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.580]   Imagine when he said that.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.580]   "In order for you to know that I have authority to forgive sins, I'm going to heal this man."
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.580]   And what does he do? Get up.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.580]   That's all he had to say.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:05.580]   Get up. He doesn't say, "We're going to have 13 sessions of healing.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.580]   We're going to have 15, and then maybe in about two years,
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:12.580]   we can kind of stiffen your muscles and your joints, and we're going to work this out."
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.580]   He's like, "No." He just said, "Get up. That's it."
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:19.580]   And he gets up. He goes home. The end.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.580]   That's all. Easy.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.580]   It is much more difficult to say, "Your sins are forgiven."
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:35.580]   Now, having said that, because it is easy to say,
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.580]   because it is easy to say,
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.580]   we have handed out this forgiveness.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.580]   If you want to be forgiven, just come up. Just come up.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.580]   See what I'm saying? Okay. Now you guys are forgiven. Good. Go.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.580]   You're parted. Anybody over there?
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.580]   Anybody? You feel bad about it? Okay. Now you're forgiven, too.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:02:00.580]   We have a generation of people whose prison doors have been opened,
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.580]   and they are walking around saying, "Oh, he said I'm forgiven. The pastor said I'm forgiven.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.580]   What authority do I have to forgive sins?
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.580]   What authority do you have to forgive sins?"
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:17.580]   The only way that a man can be forgiven is according to the Word of God.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:22.580]   You can't be like, "Oh, I want to be gracious because I want them to feel loved and to be gracious,
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.580]   and so I want to give them assurance of salvation."
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:31.580]   Giving assurance of salvation to a man who hasn't truly been forgiven is a death sentence
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.580]   because you've given him false hope to live the rest of his life,
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.580]   and then to meet the judge, and he says, "I never forgive you.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:43.580]   You never repented. You never asked for forgiveness.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:51.580]   They who did not represent me, who had no authority against what I have explicitly said in the Scripture,
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:58.580]   has passed out forgiveness and pardoning when I never did."
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.580]   Think how serious of a sin that is.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:10.580]   Think about the consequences of passing out forgiveness when it's not really there,
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:16.580]   which is easier to say you're forgiven just so that they would feel better,
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:22.580]   just so that they would feel welcome, and then have an easy, comfortable life
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:32.580]   until they meet the only one who can truly be, to be, to give the forgiveness.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:40.580]   This is very, very serious, and this is why Paul says,
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:45.580]   "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God."
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:46.580]   I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:54.580]   The first thing that disqualifies a preacher is that he is more afraid of man's opinions than God's.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:04:00.580]   He is more concerned about the power of man and the social pressure than he is of God.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:05.580]   He is more afraid of losing people in his church and opinions of people than he is of God.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:10.580]   Then he has been disqualified to represent God.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:14.580]   Because the only way that true peace can come, the only way that true salvation can come,
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:23.580]   is when the only person who has the authority to forgive sins actually forgives sins, actually pardons.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:28.580]   Colossians 1 Corinthians 1, 22, 24, "For indeed, Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom,
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.580]   but we preach Christ crucified."
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:37.580]   Was Apostle Paul able to perform signs? Of course, he's an apostle.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:43.580]   All the apostles were given authority to heal people, to open their eyes, even raise people from the dead.
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.580]   So could he have done that easily? Because that authority was given to him.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:53.580]   Could he have argued with the Greeks in wisdom? Yes, he was the top scholar.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.580]   He was a direct disciple of Gamaliel.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:00.580]   And so if he wanted to argue, Paul would have been perfect to argue and win every argument.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.580]   But he says, "No, that's not where the power is. They're not going to be convinced.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.580]   They're not going to convert because of that."
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.580]   He said, "We preach Christ crucified.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:14.580]   It is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is the power of God to those who are being saved."
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.580]   The power is not in our personality.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.580]   The power is not in you.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:23.580]   The power is not like if you just love bomb people.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:27.580]   If we just love bomb people, you can get them to come.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.580]   You can get them to love you. You can get them to love the church.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:35.580]   But you can't get them to repent.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:42.580]   You can do everything that you can do in your power to get them to like what you like and to appreciate you and to thank you.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.580]   But you have no power, and I have no power to bring them to repent.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.580]   Only God has the authority to do that.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:56.580]   So the best thing that we can do is to present the clear, unadulterated gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.580]   For in it is the power of God.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:07.580]   For some, they may be offended. For some, it is the power of God when they repent.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:13.580]   Let me conclude with this, the response of the crowds in verse 25 and 26.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:20.580]   "And immediately he got up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home glorifying God.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:30.580]   They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God, and they were filled with fear, saying, 'We have seen remarkable things today.'"
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:36.580]   The miracle that took place wasn't that this man was able to walk.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:41.580]   I mean, all those people who are trying to get in, couldn't Jesus have walked out and said, "You're forgiven"?
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:47.580]   I mean, the reason why we get into, when we go to India, into a room, because we don't have the manpower to do that.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:51.580]   We don't have the manpower, but if we did, right?
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:57.580]   If we had 30 eye doctors and 30 doctors, I mean, we could be outside, just spread out and heal everybody.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.580]   But couldn't Jesus have done that by himself?
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:06.580]   Couldn't he have done that by himself? Couldn't he have demonstrated his power and all of them healed and just went home?
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:10.580]   If thousands came, he healed a whole thousand. If 10,000 came, he healed 10,000.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:14.580]   Why did he restrict himself to that room?
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:19.580]   Because he didn't come to heal the paralytic. That was not his ultimate goal.
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:23.580]   He came to forgive sins.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:28.580]   This man was healed and went home, and he said, "They were filled with amazement."
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:33.580]   And what does it say? How does it end? "And they were in fear."
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:39.580]   And I said, "Wait a second. Why does it end in fear? Fear is negative."
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:45.580]   When you are genuinely in the presence of the glory of God,
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:52.580]   there is peace, there is joy, and there is fear.
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:57.580]   That was evidence that he met God.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.580]   Not just that. If all he did was have his leg healed, he would have been like,
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:07.580]   "Oh, thank God I'm healed now. I can be normal. I can walk, and I'm no longer paralytic."
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.580]   And that would have been it. But why was he fearful?
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   Why was he fearful? Because he met God.
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:29.580]   The true healing, true healing, always causes a reverence and fear in God's people.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:33.580]   And it is this reverence and fear that leads to worship.
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:38.580]   When we recognize God, because we don't worship what is common.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:44.580]   I know the NBA playoffs, who pays money to go see middle-aged men play basketball?
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:50.580]   You almost have to pay them to come. We'll give you $10 for everybody that comes and watches us play.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:54.580]   Even then, like $10 for five hours? I'm not going to go there.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:59.580]   We don't worship what's common. We don't follow what's common.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:06.580]   We don't obey what's common. It's when we recognize the awe of God.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:13.580]   We follow him. We worship him. We adore him. We wait for him.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:18.580]   And the evidence of the healing in this man was not that he was just walking.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   The evidence of the healing in this man was that his eye was open, and he met God.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:38.580]   In the midst of all that we do, let's be careful that we don't prepare for the wedding ceremony and miss the whole point.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:44.580]   Everything that we do is so that he can bring us to him.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:50.580]   Because all that has gone wrong in our lives is because of our sins.
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:10:01.580]   If we would pursue forgiveness as urgently and as desperately as we pursue everything else in our lives,
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.580]   imagine what our lives would be like.
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:14.580]   Let's take some time to pray again as our worship team comes and leads us.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:20.580]   As our worship team leads us, let's take some time for personal prayer and reflect upon the word of God,
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:26.580]   that you would not just be the hearers of the word, but that you would be doers of the things that you have heard.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:29.580]   Again, let's take some time to pray.
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.580]   [Prayer is sung.]

[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:32.580]   Let's pray.
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:38.580]   Heavenly Father, we ask that the words that you have implanted in our hearts and in our mind,
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:41.580]   that it would bear fruit throughout the week.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:46.580]   Help us, Lord God, to know the great gift that we have,
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:52.580]   and that Christ has suffered all, sacrificed all, to forgive us of our sins.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:56.580]   To know, Lord God, that we have been freed from the bondage of sin,
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.580]   that we have been called and made slaves to righteousness.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:05.580]   Help us to reflect that grace, that love, that spirit, Lord God,
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.580]   that wherever we go, that we may reflect the aroma of Christ.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:15.580]   So we pray that you would help us to open our eyes to see the darkness that is around us.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:20.580]   Help us, Lord God, to move from frustration to prayer,
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:26.580]   to move from any despair, Lord God, to hope in the power of Jesus Christ.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:30.580]   Help us, Lord, not to simply be hearers of the word, but to be doers.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:34.580]   May Christ and Christ alone be magnified.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.580]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:47.580]   God sent his Son, they called him Jesus.
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:57.580]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:07.580]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:17.580]   An empty grave is there to my Savior lay.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:27.580]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:37.580]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:47.580]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:57.580]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
