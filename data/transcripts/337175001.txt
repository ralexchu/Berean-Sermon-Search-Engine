[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   - Thank you, Pastor Mark.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.180]   And it's fine.
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.660]   I mean, I know Corey can be both a male and female name.
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.900]   You did a better job than me because I think last time I came up, I didn't even
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.180]   acknowledge her.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.020]   So, yeah, I think I said I had two kids and I realized, "Oh, wait, no,
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.900]   I have three."
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.100]   So, you're ahead of the curve.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.540]   All right.
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.060]   Again, I'm grateful for this opportunity to come and share the Word of God with you
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.700]   this morning.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.220]   And so, let's pray and then I'm going to jump into the sermon.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.980]   Lord God, thank you again so much for this morning and, again,
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.460]   what an opportunity to come and to worship you in spirit and in truth,
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.580]   in connection, in relationship with our spiritual family.
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.180]   Thank you so much for providing this avenue and we pray, Lord God,
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.100]   that as we go into your Word this morning, that you would engage us,
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.140]   that you would help us, Lord God, to be sober, to be alert,
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.580]   to know, Lord God, that we have been given a tremendous honor to be messengers
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.460]   of your gospel.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.980]   And so, please, Lord God, help us to understand that this morning.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.540]   And we pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.100]   Amen.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.220]   This week was a little bit more hectic than most weeks because this Saturday,
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.740]   we'll be departing to go overseas.
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.100]   And so, there's a lot of things that our family is just juggling
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100]   through right now.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.940]   And so, the title of the sermon is kind of...it wasn't my first option, okay?
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.180]   It was more like, it was Saturday morning and Pastor Mark messaged me and said,
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.260]   "Hey, I need a sermon title."
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.820]   I'm like, "Uh."
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.700]   And typically, for me, that's kind of an indication like, "Oh,
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.980]   there's going to be some problems because either you don't have a main point that
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.020]   you want to stick to and it's just like a hot mess."
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.340]   But I titled this sermon, "Planning to Fail or Failing to Plan,"
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.420]   primarily because there was a quote that stood out to me by John J.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.660]   Beckley.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.820]   And his quote is, "Most people don't plan to fail, they fail to plan."
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.580]   And I think as our family is getting ready to leave, there was something in my heart
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.740]   that said, "You need to plan the next phase of your life now."
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.660]   And it was just such a great opportunity even though life was pretty hectic this
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.780]   week and, you know, my sister-in-law is having a baby shower today,
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.060]   so my wife was busy doing that.
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.140]   And my wife is amazing, Jen is amazing, she's juggling all that and packing all
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.540]   of our stuff.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.540]   But that afforded me the time to start thinking ahead.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.860]   What can we do to prepare for this next phase in life?
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.060]   And obviously, this quote who came from this guy isn't anything new in God's eyes,
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.140]   right?
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.340]   There was always a plan, there was always something that involves
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.980]   planning and purpose.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.420]   1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27 says, "Do you not know that in a race,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.500]   all the runners run, but only one receives the prize?
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.140]   So run that you may obtain it.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.340]   Every athlete exercises self-control in all things.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.500]   They do it to receive a perishable reef, but we, an imperishable.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.460]   So I do not run aimlessly, I do not box as one beating the air,
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.220]   but I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.380]   to others, I myself should be disqualified."
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.140]   And so, as we see in this text, in this imagery of an athletic life,
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.940]   Christian living is designed to be with purpose and with plans.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.940]   And so, as I come before you this morning with God's word,
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.020]   I just want to share with you guys, I guess, four components of our plan
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.860]   when we get overseas, what we hope to do and hope to accomplish,
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.780]   primarily in regards to just our own spiritual walk, okay?
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.660]   I hope that any one of these goals that we share with you may resonate
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.740]   with you.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.220]   I hope that something will stick in your heart, something will stick
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.980]   in your mind, and that you'll take away with that, and that it will be
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.060]   impactful for you.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.740]   And if you ever are reminded, "Hey, I remember that sermon that
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.660]   Pastor Alex gave, and I remember this one point," take some time to pray
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.180]   for us as well.
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.900]   We are in dire need of your prayers.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.820]   And so, the first point, and I'm sorry, I didn't make a PowerPoint today,
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.180]   so we're in old school, so listen carefully.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.620]   We're going to be flipping through our Bibles.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.060]   Turn with me to Hebrews 6, 11 through 12.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.260]   I felt confident I could use Hebrews 6 because you guys probably won't get
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.500]   there until next year.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.620]   So, hopefully, by then, you guys will forget about this.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.340]   But Hebrews 6, 11 through 12.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.900]   And the first component of our plan, at least in regards to our own spiritual
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:45.580]   walk, is to be more assured of my salvation, to be more assured of my
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.140]   salvation than today.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.780]   And so, the question we must ask is, "What is assurance?
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.500]   What does that word mean?"
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.540]   We're not talking about insurance, we're talking about assurance.
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.220]   And the way I would define assurance is, it's that unwavering belief that your
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.180]   faith in Christ is real, genuine.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.060]   You're not looking at the doctrine of what brings about salvation,
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.580]   but you're looking at the quality of belief.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.940]   All right?
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.020]   There's a book I read recently by Sinclair Ferguson.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.180]   It was titled, "The Whole Christ."
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.300]   And his book was basically talking about legalism, antinomianism,
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.180]   and a specific controversy in the Presbyterian Church a long time ago.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.420]   And there was a specific book that was written that kind of sparked this
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.780]   controversy called, "The Marrow of Modern Divinity."
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.740]   And "The Marrow of Modern Divinity" was kind of written like Pilgrim's Progress,
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.900]   where you have different characters talking to each other, and as you see their
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.300]   conversation, it kind of produces like this understanding of certain doctrines
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.940]   from the Bible.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.020]   And so, there's this conversation that took place between these two characters
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.380]   named, Neophytus and Evangelista.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.020]   And I wanted to share with you this conversation just so you get the gist of
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.300]   what assurance means.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.220]   Neophytus starts off by saying, "Sir, I know that the foundation whereon I am to
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.460]   ground my faith remains sure, and I think I have already built thereon.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.940]   But yet, because I conceive a man may think he has done so when he has not,
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.660]   therefore, would I fain know how I may be assured that I have so done?"
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.900]   And so, Evangelista, he replies, "Well, now I understand you what you mean.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.140]   It seems you do not want a ground for your believing, but for your believing that you
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.780]   have believed."
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.260]   I know that you're going like deep dive, right?
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.540]   You're like, "Oh, my gosh, do I believe what I actually believe?"
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.540]   And that's what assurance is actually focusing on, right?
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.620]   We could come and sing songs every Sunday.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.460]   We come to Bible study and participate in filling out the worksheets and listening
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.860]   to the Word of God being taught.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:08.580]   But if that just stays in your head and it's just knowledge, and it doesn't move
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.060]   you to some sort of action, then you have to answer this question,
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.860]   "Do you actually believe what you believe?"
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.900]   Now, why assurance?
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.100]   Why do I want to be more assured of my salvation than today?
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.420]   Well, the assurance of salvation was one of the most...one of the prominent biblical
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.260]   truths that affected my walk with God immediately.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.940]   It was a chapter in J.C. Ryle's book, Holiness, called Assurance.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:44.700]   And that chapter just really flipped my world upside down because it caused me
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:51.420]   to recognize that if I truly believe what I see in Scripture, then my life needs to
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.620]   match up, at least align myself to what the Scripture is saying, right?
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.220]   There's no halfway in, halfway out when it comes to Christianity.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.980]   There's no category for that in the Scriptures.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.740]   You're all in or you're all out.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.780]   And so, by responding to the gospel, by going all in, there was a certain degree
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:18.020]   of purpose and direction, at least for my life and in Jen's life.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:25.060]   And it gives us assurance that whatever we're doing, we know has value and purpose
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.460]   in God's eyes.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.780]   I'm going to quote from J.C. Ryle, and I hope that this quote will help you
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.740]   understand more about what assurance can do for the Christian life.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:45.620]   Ryle writes, "Now, assurance goes far to set a child of God free from this painful
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.420]   kind of bondage and thus ministers mightily to his comfort.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.540]   Assurance enables him to feel that the great business of life is a settled
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.300]   business, the great debt, a paid debt, the great disease, a healed disease,
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.620]   and the great work, a finished work.
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:08.700]   And all other businesses, diseases, debts, and works are then by comparison small.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.740]   In this way, assurance makes him patient in tribulation, calm under bereavements,
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:21.500]   unmoved in sorrow, not afraid of evil tidings, in every condition, content,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.300]   for it gives him a fixedness of heart.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.220]   Assurance sweetens his bitter cups.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.780]   It lessens the burden of his crosses.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.220]   It smooths the rough places over which he travels.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.460]   It lightens the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.180]   It makes him always feel that he has something solid beneath his feet and
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.060]   something firm under his hands.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.940]   A sure friend by the way and a sure home at the end.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:58.260]   And so when it comes down to assurance, it provides this, I guess you could say,
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:04.900]   a safety net of sorts when you walk in faith, as you walk as a Christian wherever
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.260]   you are, whether it's on campus, whether it's at work, whether it's at home.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.980]   Because we have to remind ourselves, right, we are not of this world, right?
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.180]   We're not supposed to be liked by this world.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.220]   And as a result, pressures will come, whether pressures from inside our own
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:30.340]   hearts, whether pressures from outside, pressure is going to come.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:38.420]   And if we understand what this doctrine does for us, it frees us, it empowers us,
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.020]   it enables us to continue to walk by faith and not by sight,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.420]   even in the stormiest seasons of our lives.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:56.260]   Turn with me to Hebrews chapter 6, 11 through 12, and it says,
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.220]   "And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness,
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.740]   to have the full assurance of hope until the end, so that you may not be sluggish,
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.660]   but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:16.100]   And so, I looked at this passage because there are three reasons why we should
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.900]   pursue assurance, right?
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.660]   Why that should be at the forefront of our minds as we pursue Christ.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:28.780]   And the first desire for assurance is so that we may not be sluggish
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.940]   in our present lives, right?
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.500]   So that we may not be sluggish, right?
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.820]   In deepening our sense of assurance, it can only heighten the awareness
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:46.260]   of God's presence, His grace, His holiness, every other attribute of God, right?
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.300]   It only heightens that in our lives.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:55.420]   The word sluggishness there could be replaced with the word dullness, right?
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:01.660]   So sluggishness or dullness will not be an issue because we know our purpose.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.180]   We know what the end goal of our lives is supposed to be.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.860]   And so, we have purpose.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.860]   We do not lack direction.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:18.260]   The second reason to desire assurance is so that we may be imitators of those
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.820]   in our past who confess faith.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:28.980]   Now, pursuing assurance can be a lonely thing because sometimes we don't think
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.940]   about our salvation in that way.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.820]   And as a result, it can be very, very lonely.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:42.900]   But Hebrews 6, 11 through 12 tells us that it's not a lonely path at all.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.380]   In fact, many other believers have walked down this path in history.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:52.900]   It's a sense of assurance for us knowing that this path is the right path that
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.780]   we're supposed to be on because so many others have gone before us.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:04.780]   We have a rich history as believers of faithful men and women who ran this race
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.940]   of faith, and so we need to tap into that resource to know our spiritual heritage,
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:16.620]   to understand what these brothers and sisters have gone through in the past.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.980]   The third reason we should desire assurance is because we get to inherit the
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.980]   promises that God has already given, right?
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.820]   We get to inherit the promises that have already been given.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.700]   And these promises, we get to enter the kingdom of God, right?
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.020]   We get the forgiveness of sins if we confess it in faith.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.660]   We're able to understand that our life does not belong here.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:54.700]   So we don't waste our resources trying to build our kingdom here, but we wisely and
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:02.220]   shrewdly use our resources so that we can see God's kingdom expand here in the
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.580]   proclamation of the gospel, in the planting of churches,
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.780]   in the discipling of the believers.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.980]   Now, you guys might be wondering why assurance, right?
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.740]   Why are you talking about assurance so much?
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.260]   I mean, you are a pastor.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.020]   You've gone overseas, right?
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:28.940]   And I don't share this with you because I'm doubting my salvation, right?
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.700]   I'm pretty assured of my salvation.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:37.220]   But the reason why I share this prayer request with you is because I want to know
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.300]   more about who my God is, right?
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.380]   I want to know more.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.780]   I desire that intimacy with Him.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.100]   And when you desire that intimacy and when you walk in obedience to what God has
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:58.740]   called you to do, you will see a quality of life in you that is so much more
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.380]   different than your past life, than before you were a believer.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.540]   And it should cause us to hunger more for that.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.900]   And so, the first one that, again, the first component of our plan when we go
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:18.060]   overseas is so that we would be more assured of our salvation than today.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.500]   Now, I move to my second point here.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:29.060]   Our second component is to continually count the cost of a life abandoned
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.740]   to Christ.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:36.460]   To continually count the cost of a life abandoned to Christ.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.940]   So, if you turn with me to Mark 8, verse 34, let's go ahead and open up your app
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.940]   and go to Mark 8, probably faster than me.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.460]   Mark 8, verse 34.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:59.100]   And in this particular section of Scripture, Christ is teaching his
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:05.540]   disciples and what he is teaching them is paradigm shifting, right?
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:10.860]   My professor, Dr. Harris, would say, "These are theological bombshells,"
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.060]   right?
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.900]   Because it's just like, "Boom," right?
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.380]   To these disciples.
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.820]   It's the first time that they're hearing that Jesus affirmed his messiahship,
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.820]   right?
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.860]   The first time that Jesus affirms that he is the Messiah.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.900]   Okay?
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.420]   This is also the first time where Jesus speaks about his death and resurrection
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.580]   to his disciples.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.500]   Okay?
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:40.100]   And we're going to focus on this third theological bombshell because in Mark
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:49.700]   8, verse 34, he lays out for them, what is the cost of being a disciple?
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:56.060]   And the primary focus of this cost comes in these three commands here.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:02.780]   "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.020]   and follow me."
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:11.460]   Three imperatives in the Greek, which means we have three commands here.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.660]   Three imperatives where there is no wriggling around whether I should obey it
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.060]   or not.
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.100]   Rather, we need to obey it.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:27.740]   And as we look at these three commands, I want to point out that there are two
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:33.900]   relationships that are going to be sacrificed.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.300]   Two relationships that are going to be sacrificed.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   In one sense, Christ is calling for an end to a relationship of yourself.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.380]   The word "deny" here means to act in a selfless manner, right?
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:58.500]   To deny yourself means to basically no longer consider yourself.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:05.820]   One commentator wrote in regards to the word "deny," "I must not confess myself
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:12.180]   and my own being nor cling to myself, but abandon myself in a radical renunciation
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.420]   of myself and not merely of my sins.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:21.740]   I must no longer seek to establish my life of myself, but I resolutely accept
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:28.100]   death and allow myself to be established by Christ in discipleship."
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.580]   So when it comes to denying yourself, right, it's a command in which we are
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:38.220]   called to renunciate ourselves, right?
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.620]   I mean, you can look at the culture, you can look at the news,
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:46.500]   you can see what people are going after, and it's strong, guys.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.180]   I mean, having been in America for the last seven months, I mean,
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.820]   I'm like ready to leave.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.060]   I was getting my teeth done and, you know, they have a TV up on the ceiling,
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.660]   which I've never done that before because I haven't gone to the dentist
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.100]   in a long time.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.900]   And I'm just reading the little ticker things, the headlines, and I'm just,
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.300]   like, getting so discouraged.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.780]   And maybe it's because I'm getting drilled too, you know, by the dentist.
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.140]   But, man, it was just, like, really discouraging to see what was going on.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:21.460]   And seeing the commercials, you know, like, "Lose weight by coming
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.860]   to our office and, you know, sucking out your fat."
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.300]   I mean, they said it more nicely than that.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.140]   That's what I understood it as, you know.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.380]   "You've been injured in an accident.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.780]   Call this lawyer and he'll get you all the money and he'll fight for you."
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.700]   Larry H. Parker, right?
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.620]   All this for yourself, right?
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:49.140]   And sometimes even in Christian culture, that idea of promoting yourself has
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.420]   seeped in.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:56.540]   When clearly in Scripture, Christ commands us to deny ourselves,
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:04.660]   to not worry about building yourself up or to building up your family up.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.820]   Rather, we are called to radically renunciate ourselves and to accept death
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:15.020]   and allow ourselves to be established by Christ.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.820]   So that's the first relationship in which we see comes to an end as we consider the
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.020]   cost of discipleship.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:29.700]   But the second relationship is our relationship with the world.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.140]   The phrase there, the command there, "To pick up your cross or to take up his
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:40.620]   cross," points to the sacrifice, shame, pressure, and persecution that a
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.340]   Christian will receive from this world.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.900]   John 15, 18 through 19 says, "If the world hates you,
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.820]   know that it has hated me before it hated you.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.460]   If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.940]   But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.980]   therefore, the world hates you."
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:11.860]   Now, there is always going to be an innate desire in us to be liked, right?
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:16.780]   If I have offended you in any way, it's not because I purposely offended you,
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.020]   okay?
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.020]   We all want to be liked.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:27.340]   We all want to be well thought of by our neighbors and by our coworkers.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.700]   But when it comes to that split-second decision of whether you're going to share
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.540]   the gospel with them, and if that thought enters your mind where it's like,
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.180]   "But if I share with them, they might not like me.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:47.740]   If I share with them, they might think I'm a weirdo or that I'm awkward,"
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:55.100]   that is where we see the need for us to pick up our cross, to recognize that we
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.620]   may be ashamed by this world, right?
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:04.220]   We may be shamed by this world, but we will not be shamed by Christ as long
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.260]   as we proclaim Him faithfully, boldly, and clearly.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:18.220]   Now, the last command here, "Let him deny himself, take up his cross,
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.580]   and follow me."
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:25.780]   I talked about the ending of two relationships when you follow Christ,
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.900]   when we become a disciple of Christ, right?
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:33.660]   We end that relationship with ourselves, we end that relationship with the world,
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.660]   but we also gain a relationship.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:46.300]   When I see the phrase "follow me," at least in my younger, immature days,
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.940]   I would like to think that I have matured.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:55.980]   That word "follow me" often carries a very like heavy and negative connotation,
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.940]   right?
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.740]   Who wants to be a follower, right?
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.820]   I think we've been taught in school, like, we need to be leaders,
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.540]   we need to be like, you know, innovators.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.180]   We need to be like the boss of ourselves.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:11.980]   Who wants to be a follower?
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:19.380]   However, when I look at this command to follow Christ, I think we have to come
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:25.660]   to this conclusion that though it is a command to follow Him,
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:33.220]   it is a command that is inviting a relationship into your life.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.060]   It's a command that brings about an invitation to gain a relationship
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.700]   with our Lord and Savior.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.660]   We think about the word "follow" and it sounds so derogatory, and yet,
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:57.820]   by following Christ, we gain a relationship with the greatest man alive in Jesus.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:04.500]   And so, when we understand this phrase "follow me," and we see what we gain by
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.660]   having this relationship with Jesus Christ, or to deepen that relationship
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:15.220]   with Jesus, then that command doesn't become a burden anymore.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.340]   It actually becomes an accelerant to desire Him more, to give up more
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:25.100]   of our lives for Him.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:31.140]   This particular component of our plan came into my mind because as I'm getting
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:38.700]   older, I'm finding more reasons not to give up.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.220]   Right?
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:45.100]   I'm finding more reasons to think about the cost and be like, "No."
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.620]   Right?
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.860]   I mean, people ask me if saying goodbye this time around is harder than the
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.220]   previous times, right?
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.980]   Because we did something like this three and a half years ago, right?
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:05.300]   And I would say it's actually much more difficult this time around.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.140]   And I think primarily it's because of age.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:13.020]   I'm older and the people around me are getting older.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:18.620]   You know, it's harder to see when you come back, obviously,
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.940]   your family getting older, right?
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.260]   You want to help your family.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.700]   You want to be there for your family.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.780]   You want to make sure your family is set up right.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.220]   You know, it's harder because your friends are getting older and they're going
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:38.260]   through these milestones and you're like, "You're not really a part of it."
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.340]   Right?
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.180]   Like, "I'm a part of it because of Facebook and I like a picture,
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:50.780]   but I'm not there with you celebrating these milestones."
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.940]   We're not there when suffering happens in our family, both in our spiritual and our
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.220]   physical families.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.060]   That's hard to see.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:08.820]   The older I get, the more stability I want in my life, right?
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:15.020]   When I was younger, like, it's okay if you could say, "I don't know."
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.460]   But I'm 35 now and I'm like, "Man, I don't know if I could say,
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.580]   'I don't know' anymore."
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.380]   So what do you do with your life?
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.860]   "I don't know."
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:27.140]   I want stability.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:33.020]   And so when I'm confronted by these pressures and by these situations in my
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:41.060]   life stage, the question that always comes to is like, "Is it still worth it?
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:51.260]   Like, is it still worth to pack up our bags and still go overseas?"
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:57.700]   And I can say with confidence, it's a thousand times yes,
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.340]   because of this command, "Follow me."
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:08.700]   Because in my understanding of Scripture, if I am obeying what Christ has
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:16.260]   commanded me to do in very specific applications, then I'm going to be where
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.700]   my most favorite person in the world is going to be.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.220]   And I'm going to be in his presence.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:29.540]   And I'm going to experience a joy and purpose and fulfillment and satisfaction
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:36.260]   in knowing that I am following my Lord and Savior.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.820]   And so pray, pray that our family will understand that we need to count the
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:51.580]   cost more, see where we could give up more for the sake of Christ.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:29:00.420]   Now, the third component of our plan here is to learn how to share the gospel
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:08.220]   more clearly, to learn how to share the gospel more clearly.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:12.260]   You know, prior to going out the first time, there will be moments in a day
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:17.420]   where I would go through different scenarios in my mind, where if I were to
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.420]   go and share the gospel with this person and this person responds in that way,
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.140]   how would I respond back, right?
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.860]   I know, you're probably thinking like, "You're such a weirdo.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.660]   Who thinks about that?"
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.380]   I do.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:36.540]   And I remember when we were in East Asia this past time and we were sharing the
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:42.420]   gospel with people, and we're talking about sin and we're talking about law,
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.660]   right, we're talking about you fail the commands of God and so you're destined
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.340]   for judgment.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.860]   I mean, people were like nodding their heads in like polite,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.060]   like they don't want to like embarrass you.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.380]   But there wasn't like a category in their minds for that.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.500]   It's like you're building it up for them.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.020]   And I was reading journal articles, I was just reading stuff on like,
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:10.420]   "Okay, where are more effective ways to share the gospel in Asian context?"
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.780]   And I realized that certain categories are not built in their cultural mindsets,
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.780]   right?
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.740]   I know, I'm like Asian, I should have picked this up a lot sooner.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.900]   And so I remember thinking about, "Oh, man, what if I talk...instead of talking
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:31.300]   about sin, we talk about shame, embarrassment, right?
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.940]   And we talk about honor and share the gospel in terms of those words and that
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.340]   terminology."
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.060]   And I just remember when I was sharing it in that way, it was like a light switch
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.380]   in their eyes.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.100]   Immediately, they understood.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.780]   This is what God did for me?
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.700]   He took away my shame by dying on the cross and replaced me,
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.100]   he gave me this honor?
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:01.300]   It was mind-blowing for the people that we were sharing the gospel with.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.660]   And so it got me understanding like, "Okay, I need to learn how to share the
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.460]   gospel more clearly."
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.700]   And Apostle Paul had the same prayer request too.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.580]   Colossians 4, turn with me quick.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:26.900]   Colossians 4, verse 4.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.580]   This brought me so much encouragement, right?
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:38.300]   Colossians 4, verse 3 and 4, we read that here.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:44.380]   "At the same time, pray also for us that God may open to us a door for the word to
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.340]   declare the mystery of Christ on account of which I am in prison,
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:56.780]   that I may make it clear which is how I ought to speak."
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.380]   So he's asking for prayer requests for open doors, right?
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.860]   Even though he's in prison.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.900]   But on top of that, he's saying, "Pray that I may speak clearly.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:14.100]   Pray that I could speak the mystery of Christ in such a way in which the audience
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.140]   will understand it."
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.940]   Now, if you know Paul's speaking history, it's kind of a mixed bag, okay?
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:28.860]   He wasn't this dynamic speaker in according to the cultures and customs
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.020]   found in Scripture.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:36.580]   And I'll read some Scripture passages that might paint that picture more fully.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.140]   1 Corinthians 2, verse 1.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.420]   "And I, Paul, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:48.180]   testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom."
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:48.900]   Okay?
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.580]   2 Corinthians 11, 6.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:56.540]   "Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.260]   Indeed, in every way, we have made this plain to you in all things."
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.460]   So again, the phrase, like, "Even if I am unskilled in speaking."
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.020]   2 Corinthians 10, 10.
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.940]   And this is what Paul's enemies are saying.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:16.860]   "For they say, 'His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.660]   and his speech of no account.'"
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.020]   I know we read his letters and we're thinking, "Man, Paul's such a clear
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.300]   communicator.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:30.100]   Why is he asking for, like, more prayer that he may speak it clearly?"
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:36.620]   Well, because he recognizes that you don't assume communication.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:36.780]   Right?
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:43.820]   You don't assume that you are the clearest communicator in this world.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.420]   Even though Paul has written almost 50% of the New Testament,
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:53.740]   it appears that his preaching didn't fit the stylistic demands of his time.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.140]   And yet, God still used Paul.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:03.340]   And so, if Paul is making this prayer request, then I think it provides for us a
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.260]   sanctifying moment for us.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:13.620]   Maybe we need to pray and ask God to improve our abilities to speak biblical
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:19.060]   truths so that we know how we ought to speak.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.820]   Again, communication is always going to be hazardous to your own health because of
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.860]   the frequency of misunderstandings.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:35.340]   I remember I was learning Chinese and I was paired up with Alicia and we had one
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.500]   tutor in front of us.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.940]   And he were just going over tones and going over certain words.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.980]   And I don't know what happened, but I think I was trying to say that,
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:50.020]   "Oh, I teach kids who went over to America and they came back."
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.100]   Right?
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.580]   Like, the literal translation of that word is like sea turtle.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:53.820]   Okay?
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.420]   But, you know, for Chinese people, it's like they looked at us, "Oh,
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.180]   you went overseas and you came back."
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.700]   Apparently, I said the word turtle wrong.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:08.140]   And when I told it to my teacher, I like basically said a curse word.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:08.980]   Right?
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.620]   And he knows I'm a Christian and he knows like why we're here.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:17.860]   And so, he was just laughing uncontrollably for like 10 minutes.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.660]   Like, he looked at me and was like...
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.980]   I was like, "What, man?
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.460]   Like, what did I say?"
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.100]   And finally, he pulled up his dictionary, he showed me the word,
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:32.180]   I was like really embarrassed, like what I said.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.340]   That lesson is like imprinted in my mind because of the country that we're trying
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.620]   to minister to.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.660]   In one sentence, you could say either Jesus is Lord or Jesus is a pig.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:42.940]   Right?
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:47.060]   Big difference there.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.820]   And so, the question we have to ask ourselves is, have we ever wrestled with
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.980]   the practical aspect of how to communicate the gospel?
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.940]   Have we considered that the gospel work that is presented to us requires us to
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:06.420]   pray and ask God for help to figure out what to say and how to say these
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.700]   biblical truths?
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.140]   As most of you guys know, we're going to be going overseas,
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:17.180]   but the first two years is really just going to be focused on language study.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.100]   And if you asked me three years ago about it, I would be very, very, very,
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:27.420]   very, very, very reluctant just because I'm like, "I don't want to go back to
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.740]   school."
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:39.020]   But this time around, I'm really excited to learn because I know if I learn this
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:45.460]   language, if I'm able to master it, if God gives me and Jen the grace to learn
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:55.340]   this language, how many more people will be able to understand the gospel?
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:37:00.220]   There will be no barriers or misunderstandings, but rather,
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:07.020]   they will understand it very clearly that they are in need of a savior.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.020]   And so, that's one of...
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:12.100]   That's, again, that's our third component of our plan, which is to learn the
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:18.220]   language well so that we could share the gospel as clearly as possible.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:24.420]   Now, the last component of our plan, the last component is to trust and seek
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:29.580]   after obedience and joy in Christ.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.860]   And we'll see that in Isaiah Chapter 12.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:39.580]   If you want to flip there with me, Isaiah Chapter 12.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.260]   Okay.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:50.380]   Isaiah Chapter 12, to trust and seek after obedience and joy in Christ.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.220]   Now, we got to understand the book of Isaiah.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.820]   So, in broader context, Chapter 7 through 12 could be considered like a unit in
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.620]   Isaiah, okay?
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:04.540]   And the reason why is because there are just recurring themes that are connected
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:09.300]   in all of these chapters from Chapter 7 through 12, right?
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.940]   We see in Chapter 7 through 12, there's a lot of judgment, right?
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.020]   A lot of judgment and very little blessing.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:24.140]   These judgments in Chapter 7 through 12 are against Israel and the nations.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:29.580]   In fact, if you go after 12, in Chapters 13 and on, you'll see much more judgment
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:35.140]   upon the nations, more detailed judgments.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.420]   And so, because there are so much judgment in Chapter 7 through 12,
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:43.940]   when you come across the blessings, right, it just really stands out to you, right?
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:47.100]   It's such a strong contrast.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:53.180]   And some of these blessings include the promise of the Messiah, right?
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:59.100]   Right, the root of Jesse, the Prince of Peace.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.300]   Blessings include a remnant that will be kept by the Lord, right?
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.700]   That there will be a small group of the people of God.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.260]   They will be preserved.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.620]   And that the nations will be accepted into the kingdom of God.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.460]   So, though there is a bunch of judgment against the nations, in these same
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.420]   chapters in 7 through 12, there are promises that the nations themselves will
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.700]   enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.260]   So, when we look at Isaiah Chapter 12 specifically, we have to understand that
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:37.940]   this is a concluding chapter to this entire section.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.900]   And if you just look at Isaiah Chapter 11, it's describing this beautiful,
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:51.580]   peaceful, and just world because the Messiah is on the throne, the root of Jesse.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:56.380]   And so, Chapter 12 kind of gives us the answer to a question.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:01.860]   And the question is, how should the people of God respond when all
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.020]   of these good blessings come?
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.980]   When there's all this peace, when there's all this, you know,
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:16.580]   this goodness that comes from knowing that the Messiah reigns on high?
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.460]   Remember, the audience has just heard a bunch of judgment.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.100]   And now, all of a sudden, these blessings are coming.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.980]   So, they're probably trying to reconcile, "What are we supposed to do here?"
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.760]   And we see in verse 1 that they're called to be thankful, right?
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.540]   "You will say in that day, 'I will give thanks to you, O Lord,
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:38.820]   for though you were angry at me, your anger turned away that you
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:43.180]   might comfort me.'" And there are, again, two reasons for their thankfulness.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.140]   God was angry and now he is not.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:51.220]   And the same God who was angry is now there to comfort them.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.780]   Now, again, we could come across this verse and read it as if it was nothing.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.180]   I mean, we could read it very quickly.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:07.240]   But if we sit and dwell upon this truth, I think it will be beneficial for us.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.160]   I hope as believers and as members of our church that we don't fall into the trap
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:19.760]   of thinking that God is somehow some irrational, knee-jerk-reacting God, right?
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:25.120]   God's anger is not based off of an emotional response.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.440]   God's anger, when we see in Scripture, does not come as a result of him just
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.880]   feeling insulted and his pride got hurt.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:42.000]   As we know, God and Israel had this relationship because of the Mosaic Covenant.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.680]   If Israel obeyed, God would richly bless them.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:51.600]   If Israel disobeyed, then God will bring upon discipline and judgment.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.840]   And again, we must know that God's anger is something we do not trifle with.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:02.200]   If you look at chapter 7 through 12 in Isaiah, you will see a lot of anger and
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.440]   a lot of judgment.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:11.520]   In fact, Isaiah chapter 9, 14 through 16 talks about God eliminating Israel's king
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.320]   and prophets, right?
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:18.280]   In essence, saying, "Relationship with you is done."
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.920]   We see in Isaiah chapter 9, verse 17, that God is not going to rejoice
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:32.080]   over their young men nor have compassion on the fatherless and the widows.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:44.280]   Isaiah 9, 18 through 21, in God's judgment, he allows sin to run amok, unabandoned.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:50.600]   Isaiah chapter 10, 5 through 11, there's a raising of enemies that are just bent
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.720]   on the destruction of Israel.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:43:01.560]   And that's just a small snippet of what God's anger comes in the form of.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   Now, Israel in these last days where the Messiah is reigning has to recover
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.320]   from all that.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.720]   They have to recover from what they have experienced, they have to recover what
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.680]   they have seen, they have to reconcile what just took place and what is taking
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.760]   place now.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.520]   Things are good now.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.160]   We just came out of this bad situation.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:30.080]   So how do we respond?
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:37.520]   Again, if I were Israel and if I was fully aware of my sins, again,
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:43.240]   it would be very, very hard for me to think that God would ever forgive me.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:48.760]   If our nation has fallen that far off, if I'm a member of Israel,
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   if our nation has gone so far away, how do we know that we have been forgiven?
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.640]   How do we know that these good blessings are not just simply going to be taken away
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.680]   because we disobeyed again?
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.320]   Again, we're not just simply talking about facts and doctrines here,
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:09.760]   but we need to be assured and believe that in fact God has forgiven,
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:16.040]   that God has replaced our shame and has shown us his love and his mercy.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.000]   And so I want to give you guys just two fruits that are going to come forth that
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.560]   will be indicators of that assurance and forgiveness that we see in Isaiah 12,
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.800]   chapter 12, verse 2 and 3.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.440]   And the first fruit is trust.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.960]   We see in verse 2, "Behold, God is my salvation.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.840]   I will trust and will not be afraid."
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:44.080]   The word trust here describes a reliance upon someone confidently.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.600]   Again, don't mix up the word trust and faith or belief, right?
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.720]   There's a slight difference here, okay?
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:58.600]   One theological dictionary states, "It is significant that in the Septuagint
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.200]   or the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, they never translate this
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:08.720]   word, trust, with believe in.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:17.600]   In fact, the word trust in the Septuagint is translated to have hope in, right?
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:23.800]   This would seem to indicate that this Hebrew word for trust does not connote
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.840]   that full-orb intellectual and volitional response to revelation,
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.920]   which is involved in faith.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:36.520]   Rather, it stresses the feeling of being safe and secure, right?
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.440]   So it's one thing to say you believe it, but it's another thing to trust it.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:46.000]   Because when you trust in something, you feel safe, you feel secure.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.200]   And so again, how can Israel trust God after seeing all of this anger and
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.160]   judgment being poured out?
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.120]   Well, the first thing that they trust is that they see God as their salvation.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.480]   That's mentioned twice in verse 2.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.120]   God is my salvation.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.040]   He has become my salvation.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.600]   And the word salvation there gives us the image of something that was once narrow,
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.800]   but someone made wide, okay?
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.440]   It is a move from something distressful to safety, okay?
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.480]   So the first thing of trust is recognizing who God is.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.960]   God is my salvation.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:27.760]   Secondly, it's what the word promised would happen.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.680]   If you don't like spoilers, I'm sorry, but Deuteronomy 28 kind of spoils it
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.880]   for Israel, okay?
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.360]   Deuteronomy 28 reveals all these blessings and curses.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:45.360]   But when you get to Deuteronomy 30 verse 1, that is the spoiler here.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.880]   Because God, through Moses, tells the nation of Israel,
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.960]   "And when all these things come upon you," right?
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.840]   There's no if there.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.440]   It's when.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.480]   And so if there was some Israelite in Moses' camp that was thinking, "Oh,
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.200]   yeah, we're just going to obey God and we're going to get all these blessings.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.360]   We're not going to get any of those curses."
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:11.240]   Sorry, you optimist.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:18.480]   God has made it clear that the blessings and curses are going to fall upon Israel.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.000]   But Deuteronomy 30 continues on.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.120]   "And when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.960]   set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:35.040]   God has driven you, and return to the Lord your God, you and your children,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.960]   and obey his voice and all that I command you today with all your heart and with all
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.640]   your soul, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have mercy
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.560]   on you.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.960]   And he will gather you again from all the peoples where the Lord your God has
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.520]   gathered you."
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:56.360]   And so trust came in the form of trusting in God, knowing that the same God who
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:03.880]   judged Israel is now the same God who is our salvation.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:09.680]   But to trust and also to trust in his word, to find safety and security in what
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.840]   we find in scriptures.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.160]   You believe what you read to be true and it informs how you ought to live,
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.960]   which then leads into the second evidence of knowing whether you have, you know,
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.080]   having this assurance.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.640]   Joyful obedience.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.600]   We see that in verse 3.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:36.640]   "With joy, you will draw water from the wells of salvation."
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.920]   Now, we have to unpack that phrase a little bit because you're thinking like,
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   "What does drawing water have to do with joyful obedience?"
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.160]   Okay?
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.080]   The first phrase in the Hebrew text is the phrase, "You will draw water."
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.200]   Now, we know that drawing water here is not like a literal, like you have to take it
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.400]   out of the well, right?
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   It's not literal because you're taking it out of the wells of salvation.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:56.560]   Okay?
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.080]   So this sentence is meant to be taken like metaphorically here.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:01.320]   Okay?
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.240]   "You will draw water."
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   And so this phrase is a metaphor for a renewed life.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.160]   It is a life of obedience.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:16.680]   It is a life recognizing that you have been renewed.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.800]   By drawing out the water, it is telling us that the people are living their life
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.360]   according to God's word in faithful obedience.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.600]   Because why?
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.880]   Where are they drawing this water from?
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.000]   The wells of salvation.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.080]   And while that word obedience, again, brings up this connotation of drudgery
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:44.160]   and forced action, again, I think what I was struck by was the next phrase,
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:50.800]   "With joy," or some translation, "Joyously."
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:55.480]   Now, I don't know about you, but I've never drawn water from a well before,
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.200]   but I can imagine that it's very tiresome, right?
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.800]   It's a lot of work to pull up that little bucket of water and then pour it
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:07.240]   into a bigger bucket, and then to carry that bigger bucket back home.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.720]   It is done out of necessity.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.160]   And so I find it hard to believe someone is going to wake up in the morning really
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.280]   excited to go to a well and draw water from it.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.080]   But the more I think about this metaphor, the more appropriate I believe it reflects
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.600]   a Christian life.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:29.400]   Because again, obeying what we see in Scripture is hard, right?
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.480]   A lot of times we see what we see in Scripture and we're like,
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.560]   "Do I really have to do this?"
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.440]   We sometimes think it's up for debate.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.120]   "No, God, you didn't really call me to do that.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.400]   No."
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:51.440]   But as we see from verse 3, if we really believe that we have this
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.480]   renewed life in Christ, then the commands that we see in Scriptures
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.800]   are not a command.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.200]   We see it as a choice, and it's a joyous choice.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:09.600]   It's a choice that we choose with joy to follow and to obey.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:15.200]   And so this metaphor really, again, just captures what we want to try and do
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:21.080]   when we're overseas, to continue to trust, to continue to obey,
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.680]   and to obey with joy.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.160]   And the reason why I share that with you is because when we're, again, overseas,
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.080]   it was so hard.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:37.160]   I mean, there were days where you're just in darkness, and it's not because
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.120]   of the pollution, but you're in darkness because spiritually,
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.200]   you're just in a dark place.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.000]   You're dwelling upon mistakes.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.440]   You're dwelling upon disappointments, discouragements, uncertainty,
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:58.600]   and it just piles and piles and piles on your shoulders.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:04.240]   And again, you start answering some of these questions with, "I don't know.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.880]   I don't know. I don't know. I don't know."
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:12.440]   It gets tiring. It gets shameful, right?
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:18.640]   It appears that you don't know what you're doing.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:29.520]   And I think in the end, what this verse reminds me of is the fact that it's okay.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:35.800]   It's okay to have those burdens because you get to draw water from the wells
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:40.400]   of salvation with joy.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:45.080]   It's a battle to maintain obedience in a worshipful and joyful manner,
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.360]   and it takes its toll.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.680]   But isn't it necessary for all of us to draw water from these wells
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.400]   of salvation in our lives?
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:02.280]   Absolutely.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.960]   In a book that I'm reading, Maurice Roberts, "The Thought of God,"
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:10.480]   he wrote, "Let no one imagine that the spending of much time conscientiously
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:16.440]   in daily fellowship with Christ will result in loss of service.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:22.160]   Time spent with God in the secret place is never the case of spiritual inefficiency.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:27.440]   On the contrary, it is the highway to fresh vision and to new triumphs.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.520]   To have prayed well is to have studied well.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:36.000]   This motto was Luther's and announces to us the secret of his immense labors
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.280]   and abounding faithfulness."
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:49.760]   I just want to say in conclusion, I have a lot of thank yous for this church,
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   for our church.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:57.440]   I am grateful for the leadership here who has supported and encouraged,
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:04.840]   affirmed a lot of friendships there that I'm going to miss.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.800]   I'm thankful for the pastor's wives and the leadership wives and, you know,
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:15.520]   them, like, just really just loving on Jen while we've been here.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.520]   I am grateful for the MCARE team.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.440]   You guys are awesome.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.080]   You guys are just constantly a source of encouragement for us.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:30.680]   And, yeah, I mean, I think about Andrew Fuller and the analogy of the rope,
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:36.000]   and every missionary needs someone to hold the rope, to pray, to support,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.280]   to encourage, and I'm always grateful for our MCARE team for all of that.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.120]   I'm grateful for the Sunday school program here.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:59.600]   Man, my kids are, like, loved, and I'm just sad that they have to leave.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.400]   Think of something funny.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.800]   Think of something funny.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:14.960]   Thankful for old friends and new friends that we made here.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.160]   I'm thankful that we'll be in a country where a lot of you came from,
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   and so hopefully we'll see you in the summers.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:31.680]   But overall, I'm thankful that we are part of a healthy church.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:38.760]   And though we leave, obviously, we're going to pray for Berean, of course,
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.480]   but there's a sense where we don't have to worry about what's going on here as much.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.080]   And so we're grateful.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.000]   And so I'll share some prayer requests for our team.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.680]   I don't know if you get the PowerPoint slide up on the board.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.920]   There'll be some, like, these magnets that look like this.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:02.600]   I don't think we have enough for everyone, but just one per household if possible.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.120]   Okay?
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:10.160]   If you have, like, roommates, one refrigerator per person, please.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.240]   We'll try to get more next week after we're gone.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.120]   And so maybe if you want to wait until then, you can get it then, too.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:23.000]   But obviously, sanctification and salvation for our family, everything I shared with you this morning,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.400]   that's part of the sanctification process that we want prayer for.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:34.960]   So I was interweaving these sermon points to our prayer requests, so please have that with you.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:41.480]   Salvation for our kids, salvation for our lost loved ones.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.440]   You know, pray for language acquisition.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.640]   I keep asking prayer for this because I know that I can easily get frustrated,
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:55.440]   and I want to push the limits of my own body, but I want to trust in God in this.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.680]   And so please pray for that.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.000]   Pray for transitions.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.280]   Obviously, our family is going through a lot of transitions right now.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:09.720]   Our kids, especially, are going through these transitions.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:14.680]   The first time, Haddon was only a year and a half, and he really didn't know what was going on.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.320]   But now we have, like, you know, Haddon got older, but, you know, we have Ryle, too.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:26.000]   And I think, yeah, it's going to be hard on them.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.440]   And lastly, just pray for the growth and sanctification of the Chinese church.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:38.520]   As some of you guys know, there's a lot of pressure and opposition to the unregistered churches there.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:43.680]   And so continue to pray that the church will grow as a result of this persecution,
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:48.280]   and that they will continually be involved in their gospel-sharing ministries,
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.440]   whether for them locally or overseas.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.080]   And so if you guys could take some time to pray for that, that would be very, very great.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.080]   Thank you so much.
