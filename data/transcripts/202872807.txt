[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   Well we're really glad to have the India team back.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.000]   They prepared a video for us.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.740]   So we'll first show the video and then after that we're going to invite James Hong to come
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.760]   up and share a bit of what he experienced and things that he'd like to share afterwards.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.280]   I wanted to talk a little bit about what we experienced and I understand that some of
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.520]   you or most of you have prayed for us last week and I want to give an update on that
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.660]   as well.
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.280]   First off, let me start off with the update.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.280]   I've heard different things, people saying, "I thought it happened in the villages," and
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.520]   then details were a little hazy.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.120]   What had happened was when we got to the hotel, it was the first night, we're eating dinner
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.840]   at a restaurant within the hotel.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.600]   And within that restaurant there's patrons there who have been drinking, I want to say
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.200]   a group of about 15 to 20.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.320]   And there's a cricket game on, and when I say cricket I mean like baseball, right?
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.240]   In India, cricket is a very, very big deal.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.800]   Kind of like soccer in Central America or parts of Asia.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.360]   It's a huge thing.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.320]   And the cricket game is a national game, right?
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.840]   So the team is India versus I forgot which country.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.960]   But because of that you can understand there's a sense of nationalism that's really stoking
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.600]   within these guys and then you have liquor in them too.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.480]   So what happened was at the start of the game they had asked us to stand, right?
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.560]   And obviously they didn't ask us in English, they asked us in Telugu, which is the native
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.720]   language of the Indians within that region.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.160]   They asked the pastors in Telugu if they could stand and if we could stand.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.180]   Now at this point we don't know what's going on, right?
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.160]   So one of the pastors, one of the two, replies to the patrons, "Hey look, we'll stand, but
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.640]   they're American so they're not going to stand.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.560]   We'll stand."
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.840]   And it didn't sit well with one or two people.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.760]   For the most part the group didn't like it, but for the two it really, really ticked them
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.760]   off.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.960]   So one of them turns around and kind of motions for us to stand.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.640]   And I can see he's kind of agitated at this point.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.020]   He's a little angry, right?
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.160]   So he's going like this and I hear music so I'm like, "Okay, it's a national anthem."
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.760]   So I try to get the team to stand, right?
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.360]   So we stand, but the moment we stand, we're like maybe like 10 seconds after the beginning
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   of the anthem.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.960]   We stand, we do our thing, we're very respectful, and then we sit down.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.760]   One of the patrons goes up to the pastors and they start speaking in Telugu, right?
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.960]   I find out later that he's very upset because we didn't stand right away and also he didn't
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.240]   like the pastor's answer, namely that we wouldn't stand because we're Americans.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.600]   We thought, "Okay, since they're in this country, all of them should stand and you should be
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.480]   on that bandwagon making all of us stand."
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.560]   Now none of us minded at all.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.760]   Had the team known that's what they wanted, we would have done initially, we didn't care,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   right?
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.320]   The pastors were just trying to be as accommodating as possible to us.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   And so what ended up happening is because this is a very nationalistic environment,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.680]   they have liquor in their system, they start being very aggressive, okay?
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.280]   They come up to the pastors and start yelling at them, berating them.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.920]   One of the two gets slapped in the face, okay?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.240]   And as all this is going on, the other people within their group, although they didn't really
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.080]   like what they did, they're a little bit more reasonable and they're trying to hold the
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.940]   other two back.
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.760]   So what ends up happening is the two pastors, one of them splits up, goes outside, he gets
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   hit in the...
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.640]   Unbeknownst to us at the time, he gets hit in the face, okay?
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.000]   I think what the pastor told me was two shots to the face right here.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.600]   There was some slight bruising.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.680]   The other pastor is inside and they're a hotel, they don't have any security.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.080]   The hotel waiters and employees are trying to break things up.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080]   And there was a lot of back and forth.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.320]   They would sit down and they would stare at him, so they'd get back up, sit down, stare
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.520]   and get back up.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   So finally what they decided to do was put us in a different room, okay?
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.360]   And they watched the game, we didn't see them for the rest of our trip there.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.040]   Now, but there's an update that I want to tell you guys all about, okay?
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.440]   This is how God used that situation, now that I've painted it for you.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.480]   The following day, the hotel security, well the hotel manager calls the police, okay?
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.960]   The reason he calls the police is because we've been going to the same hotel for the
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.360]   third year in a row now.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.220]   So they like our business, they want to keep our business, right?
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.160]   We order a lot of food.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.620]   We have 15 guys that stay in that hotel every year.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.040]   So for them, if they lose our business, it's a big deal.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.840]   And they know, obviously, anyone would know, if we don't want to come back, it's very easy
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.480]   for us not to come back.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.880]   So the hotel, for that reason, economic reasons, calls the police, okay?
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.920]   The police get to the scene, right?
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.280]   And they investigate the situation.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.800]   I don't know how, but they get in contact with the two people who are the most aggressive,
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.960]   who did the hitting and who did the slapping.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.920]   And then they have a conversation with them two and the two pastors.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   Now we're not present at that point for the conversation.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.560]   Because this happens, I think, late night, maybe early morning.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.600]   So we're sleeping and the police approach the pastors.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.720]   What happens is, the police learn of the situation, they side with the pastors, and they tell
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.840]   the pastors, "Hey, if you want to throw these guys in jail, if you want to quote unquote
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.080]   press charges, so to speak, we'll put them in jail."
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.800]   One of the pastors spoke up and said, "You know what?
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   We're Christians.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   We're pastors.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.760]   That's not what we want.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.360]   We really want to show the love and forgiveness in Christ."
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.840]   They were very apologetic.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.060]   From what I understand, one, if not both of them, were in tears.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.240]   And so what ended up happening was, the whole thing was squashed.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:09.480]   They actually want to come and talk to the entire team to express their sorrow over what
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.480]   happened.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.680]   They never came, I don't know what happened to them.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.320]   But that's what happened.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.760]   And the hotel had promised us, "Hey, if you want police to be present while you guys are
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.560]   here, they can arrange that for us."
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.360]   And we had a private dining room, a unit away, that we occupied for the rest of our stay
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.360]   there.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.240]   And probably will if we ever decide to go back there.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.760]   So it really turned out for the good.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.080]   It really, really did.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.580]   That I mean, you think of drunk people who are there to watch a cricket game, and these
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.360]   Americans are there, and you're not thinking two days later, "I'm going to see the glory
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.400]   of God."
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.280]   You're not thinking that, right?
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.480]   But God really used that situation to show His grace.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.000]   So anyways, that's the update.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.480]   People are asking, "That's what happened?"
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.800]   I heard a lot of different things.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.040]   I mean, it's kind of like telephone charades, you know, people were saying different things
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.680]   and it got kind of crazy.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.760]   But it was at the hotel, and it wasn't at the village.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.080]   Now I want to give a little update about India itself, and what we plan to do in India.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.800]   I'm glad you guys saw the video first, because that paints a portrait of what we did, and
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.600]   what we've done in years past.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.760]   This year, the schedule was a little different the first year.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.520]   But what happened this year was, we had three pastors come with us.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.040]   Pastor Peter, Pastor Aaron from BMC, and Pastor James Lee from Crosslife.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.600]   And we took a team of medical professionals, two optometrists, two nurses, one physical
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.680]   therapist, although he helped out with eye care, and there are three supporting people
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:49.380]   who support the optometry team, and the rest of us who kind of did VBS and just normal
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.720]   heavy lifting stuff, I guess.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.840]   What we did was, in the morning, the pastors provided pastoral training to the villagers.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:03.960]   There was a clip in here, I think you saw, where you saw about maybe 15 to 20, 25 Indian
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.320]   men between the ages of 22 and 55, right?
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:15.220]   There was a translator that was present, and on each day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.360]   Pastor Peter, Pastor Aaron, or Pastor James would give a seminar, so to speak, right?
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.440]   On hermeneutics, and then applying hermeneutics, talking about how important it is to read
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.600]   the Bible in context.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.920]   Relatively simple things that most of us probably know, but to these pastors, might be brand
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   new.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:42.080]   And so, we would get to a village at approximately 10 a.m., there was a translator that was present,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   right?
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.320]   And each village, there's a room where we would meet.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   That's like the size of maybe three rooms, it's a building, but about the size of three
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   rooms.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.640]   The pastors would give a lesson, and then the interpreter would translate.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.720]   And the pastors that were there, let's say about 25 of them, would sit there and would
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.720]   absorb this teaching.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.760]   That would go on for about 12.30, so let's say about two and a half hours.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.040]   At about 12.30, we would eat, and at about 1.30, what would happen is, we'd break up
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.360]   that same exact room where the pastoral training occurred.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.120]   We'd divide that room in half.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.280]   In one half of the room, you had eye care, and in the other half of the room, you had
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.240]   wound care, like general healthcare by the nurses.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.840]   And so, what would happen is, we'd give out numbers, and in each village that we went
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.280]   to, we'd see approximately 100 to 110 people specifically for eye care, and another, I
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.920]   wanna say, maybe 20, you could ask Sarah Kim, but 20 for wound care.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:51.400]   And the reason that was so effective is because what happens is that each of these villages,
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.020]   they're very neglected.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:10:01.360]   It's a very agricultural, rural-based village, where they don't have basic plumbing or electricity.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.580]   You can see from the videos, you're talking about straw huts, mud brick buildings, really
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.580]   things like that.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:14.540]   So, they're very neglected by not only foreigners, but the government.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.740]   So for these people, half of them are illiterate.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.980]   The vast majority of them have never seen a foreigner before.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:30.780]   These native Indians, half of them can't read, they see these Americans who look Asian, they
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.140]   don't know why.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:39.060]   They see these Americans come in, and they're providing them eye care.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:48.620]   And they're thinking, "Okay, why would a foreigner come in from far away to help me with my eyes?
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.540]   Why would they do that?"
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:58.180]   And segue to the gospel, because the villages in this part of India, almost all of India,
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.380]   but specifically these parts of India, Hinduism is entrenched.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.100]   It's not just their religion, it's their culture, it's their way of life, it's their government,
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.620]   it's the only thing they know.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.340]   And so, they don't know anything about Christianity.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.340]   They don't know that Jesus rose from the dead.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.420]   They don't understand there's 5,000 documents of the New Testament.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.380]   Understand these things.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.900]   All they know is that there's a foreigner that comes in, who's traveled long distances,
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.980]   and that foreigner says they love Jesus.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.700]   Or it's translated to them, "These foreigners are here because of Christ."
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.060]   And what that does is it gives a platform for the pastors.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.660]   Now in that context, where they're thinking, "Okay, I've never seen a foreigner before.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.780]   This is the first time I've seen a foreigner, and he wants to help me."
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.780]   This villager.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:55.460]   That gives a platform for the local pastor to say, "Hey, it's because they're Christian,
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.580]   it's because they love God, it's because their sins are forgiven.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.900]   Would you like that forgiveness?"
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.620]   And it's breaking ground.
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.540]   It's breaking ground.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.940]   The airport that we land in is called Bangalore.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.820]   It's the Silicon Valley of India.
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.500]   You have all these tech companies coming there, and then you have a major hub of training
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.460]   in terms of information and computer science.
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.300]   Once you land there, we drove about five hours to a city called Bellary.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.860]   Bellary is not the Silicon Valley of India.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.980]   It's very dingy.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.140]   It's a much different world.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.460]   From Bellary, each village that we went to took another two hours of driving.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.500]   And only recently, within the last year, were roads developed.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.820]   The year prior, it was only dirt roads.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:48.100]   So you can see how the neglect is very natural, because it's very inaccessible.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.780]   And so the ministry that we're now doing is trying to reach each village.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.100]   We've gone there for three years now.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.760]   And if you think Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, first year on Friday, each day we
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.220]   went to a different village.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.000]   We've never visited a village more than once.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.380]   And so this evangelism that we're doing, specifically in this part of India, it's very trailblazing.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.260]   It's very pioneering.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:20.060]   So I want to, after sharing what we do, I would ask this from Breen, that we continue
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.380]   to pray for the pastors.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.860]   Because our team goes, we spend a week there, and then we come back.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:31.220]   But the pastors there, some of them are being beaten for passing on tracts.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:37.260]   Some of them, what little government subsidies there are, they don't receive, because they're
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.340]   not listed as Hindu.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.380]   And some pastors just live in fear.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:49.180]   In general fear for their lives, for their own lives, and for their family, all because
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.340]   of the name of Christ.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:58.740]   And everyone in this team that has gone there this past trip will tell you how pregnant
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.140]   with meaning this trip was, for all of us.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.960]   We received so much more than we ever gave.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.340]   And so we're looking forward to doing the work in the future in India.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:17.660]   Pastor Peter is thinking about what we can do, perhaps even purchase a building for the
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.180]   pastors to train in.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:25.380]   And if that's the case, where they can go and meet together, even if it's once a month,
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.980]   and maybe we'll send people there to train them, and we will definitely continue the
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.140]   work there.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.180]   If any of your hearts are moved, you don't necessarily have to have a medical skill,
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.060]   but if you do, you should really pray about it.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.300]   But if your heart is moved, consider India.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.020]   If you have the resources and the time, just pray about it.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.380]   I know all of our schedules are busy, all of us have things to do, I completely get
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.380]   that.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.380]   But you might be surprised.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.380]   You might be surprised.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:59.300]   You might go there and come back thinking, "I've received so much more than I gave."
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:05.940]   And you come back extremely humbled, extremely blessed, and reminded of what a privilege
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.380]   it is to serve God in this way.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.660]   So, thank you very much.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:14.660]   If you would please turn your Bibles to 1 Peter chapter 2.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:24.220]   Okay, and I'm going to be reading from verse 1 down to verse 10.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:30.780]   And where it says, "Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:36.100]   envy and all slander, like newborn babies long for the pure milk of the Word, so that
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:42.780]   by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.980]   And coming to Him as a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.940]   precious in the sight of God, you also as living stones are being built up as a spiritual
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:57.940]   house for a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.940]   Christ.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.420]   For this is contained in Scripture.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:07.660]   Behold, I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious cornerstone, and he who believes in Him will
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.340]   not be disappointed.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.820]   This precious value then is for you who believe, but for those who disbelieve, the stone which
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:22.260]   the builders rejected, this became the very cornerstone and a stone of stumbling and a
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.020]   rock of offense.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.340]   For they stumble because they are disobedient to the Word, and to this doom they are also
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.340]   disappointed.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:36.660]   But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.280]   so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.060]   into His marvelous light.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.020]   For you were once not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.380]   You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.820]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.500]   Our God, we ask that you grant to us great insight into your Word.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:03.020]   As you also prepare our hearts through your Spirit, helping us to be both receptive, desiring
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.380]   to apply what you have for us, and ultimately changing our lives through it.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.900]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.960]   This passage, I read from verses 1 through 10, but we're going to be really focusing
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.100]   on verses 4 through 8.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.780]   As we take a look at this passage, we've been studying in the book of 1 Peter, through our
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:31.260]   Bible studies, and we've been talking a lot about how in certain circumstances, especially
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:36.940]   difficult circumstances, God tends to change our perspective.
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.940]   God challenges us beyond what's normal for us.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.500]   In order to help us think about this whole topic, I want to ask you a question.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.340]   Have you ever been really disappointed?
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:53.060]   Not just a little let down, not somebody, "Oh, you said you'd be there, but you weren't,
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.620]   so I was sad," but just really disappointed.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.180]   Some of these memes that I see on Facebook and the internet, they're pretty hilarious.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.460]   They have these memes where it's like, "Expectation for post-college life," and then they have
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.460]   these pictures of making money and buying a car, and then reality, it's like, "Basement
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.940]   of my mom's house."
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.020]   Stuff like that, where you have your expectations of what you hope for, for a huge stage of
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.700]   your life.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.900]   Then the second half of the meme is just like, "But the reality is this."
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:32.140]   Now, what typically happens for us, the reason why I bring that up is because whenever our
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:38.820]   expectations are up here, and then the reality comes in down here, we've got to make sense
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.380]   of that discrepancy.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:48.540]   You are now faced with an interpretive issue, how do I make sense of all that?
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.980]   Sometimes what we'll do is we'll play a little mind games.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.420]   "Therefore, now I'm a pessimist.
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.020]   Don't expect nothing out of nobody."
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.620]   You don't expect anything out of God, people, friends, family.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.500]   You're just like, "Everyone's going to let me down.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.700]   That's just how the world's going to be."
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.700]   We do that even with movies.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.700]   You don't want people to upsell the movie, so it's like, "Oh, the movie was like, 'Don't
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.700]   tell me about it.'
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.340]   I don't want to go on with expectations."
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:17.100]   You play these mind games where you start dropping your expectations, and how you even
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.700]   deal with people, what confidence you have.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.180]   On that level, we have expectations and a discrepancy of it.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.180]   It's true.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.020]   Mentally speaking, our perspective matters.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:34.380]   If for example, our expectations are unreasonably high, yeah, you're just going to really ruin
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.300]   your relationships, or you're just going to ruin everything that you hope to enjoy, but
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.300]   you're not going to.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.980]   Now, there's another issue at hand.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.660]   Sometimes I watch a movie, and someone says, "Did you like it?"
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.140]   I'm like, "No."
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.180]   They're like, "Oh, it's because you went in with too high expectations."
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.580]   "No, that movie just wasn't good."
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.940]   Sometimes you have your expectations, and then there's the reality.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.900]   Reality that sometimes some things are just really that bad.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.220]   On the flip side, even if your expectations are super low, in reality, they're really,
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.220]   really good.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:15.140]   The reason why I talk about these things is because Apostle Peter, bringing things into
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:21.060]   context, is helping people make sense of their experience.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.100]   In the book of 1 Peter, the people are experiencing a kind of persecution and suffering beyond
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.420]   our imagination.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.700]   We went over it in our Bible study, but in brief review, he starts off the letter by
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.380]   saying to you who are scattered.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.500]   You've been chased out of your homes.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:45.300]   To you who are aliens, refugees, much like what we see even today, where they have no
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.220]   provision, they have no country trying to come to their aid, they lost much to their
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.940]   family, and they're just in survival mode.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.260]   He says, "To you, I write this letter."
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:01.220]   We understand that when, again, we experience suffering, to whatever degree it may be, we
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:06.420]   need a way to interpret what's going on, and we also need a way to get a good grasp on
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   reality.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.340]   That's going to help us persevere in some of these contexts.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:21.100]   I just want to jump in right away to verses four and five to talk about the first things
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:27.020]   that Apostle Peter says to strengthen and encourage the Christians of his day.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:34.900]   Verse four and five reads like this, it says, "And coming to him as to a living stone, which
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:40.980]   has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, you also as
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:47.700]   living stones are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.860]   sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:59.580]   Now, from those two verses, I want to focus in on what is grammatically the main subject
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.580]   and verb.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.540]   What's the main point of those two verses put together?
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.020]   I have you guys practice that in Bible study and stuff.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:13.580]   The idea of coming to this living stone is incredibly important, but grammatically, the
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.620]   emphasis is on you are being built up as a spiritual house.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.780]   That's my point one here is saying you're being built up as a house for the Lord for
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.740]   a holy priesthood.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.460]   God is doing a work in these people's lives.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:35.900]   God is doing a work in our lives, and this is something we need to know, especially when
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.060]   we can't see it.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:44.380]   Essentially, what's happening here is Apostle Peter is saying, "Listen, collectively, God
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.340]   has called you for a significant purpose.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.260]   Yes, you might be chased around.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:56.140]   Other people are degrading you, saying demeaning things, persecuting you, oppressing you, and
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.300]   putting you down.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:04.420]   I'm telling you God is building you up, building you up to a purpose beyond what your physical
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.660]   eyes are seeing.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:13.380]   God is building you up to be a spiritual house, a dwelling, so to speak, and a spiritual priesthood."
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.300]   I just want to make mention of this a little bit that he's not focusing on the individual
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   like I am the temple.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.060]   He's talking about the collective whole, us as believers.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.500]   God has designed us so that piece by piece, it's a beautiful metaphor, just as the metaphor
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.400]   of the body, that you're all members united, connected together.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.780]   You are the building blocks.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:41.340]   One of the commentaries I was reading referenced that this royalty visit at Sparta because
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:47.540]   Sparta at that time in Roman culture was such a powerhouse.
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.980]   Upon visiting was kind of shocked, like, "Your city has no walls."
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.180]   So went to the ruler and said, "How come you guys don't build a wall?"
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.500]   And he looked at his soldier and said, "This is our wall.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.060]   You have walls that can carry spears and shields?"
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.940]   And they said, "Oh, shoot."
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:09.380]   As they think about that, God is building something that is a powerhouse, so to speak,
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.620]   of living stones being pieced together.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.520]   And the beautiful picture is that we are going to be serving the Lord.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.260]   We have a significance, we have a purpose.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:24.460]   And the reason why this helps is because for any individual who's ever suffered, what makes
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:29.900]   suffering worse is if it's pointless.
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.660]   What makes it very difficult to persevere and carry on is if there's no purpose behind
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.820]   this, then why?
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.860]   And a lot of times that's what people struggle with.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.780]   Is there something beyond just to make my next meal?
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.060]   Just for everything else that everybody is running for?
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.340]   Is that all I'm shooting for?
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.540]   Is that the only thing that's happening right now?
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.260]   Then why?
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.260]   Then why persevere?
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:25:00.580]   But here, there is this encouragement that God has joined us for an incredible purpose
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.700]   with incredible significance.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.460]   And Ephesians chapter 2 reiterates this whole idea.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.180]   So I read at the beginning, but let's turn our Bibles there and read it now.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.220]   Ephesians chapter 2 describes the transfer.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.420]   You were children of wrath, you were destined for destruction, you had no promise, you had
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.020]   no hope, you had no God.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.940]   And then the transfer that in Christ we have so much more.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:30.180]   Now, if you ever get the time, if you have the time, just read it in whole, but for our
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:34.860]   purposes we're going to be reading from verse 17 through 22.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:41.500]   And he says, "And he came and preached peace to you who are far off, peace to those who
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.180]   are near.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:48.460]   For through him we both have our access in one spirit to the Father."
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:53.940]   So in Christ we have this access, and he says, "So then you're no longer strangers and aliens,
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.180]   but you're fellow citizens."
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.500]   So now we have citizenship, we have this fellowship, we have this brotherhood, and he says, "With
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.700]   all the saints in our God's household."
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.060]   Wow, now we have a belonging to an intimate household setting.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.500]   Verse 20, "Having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:17.260]   himself being the cornerstone in whom the whole building being fitted together is growing
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:25.020]   up," and look at this, "into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.420]   together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit."
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.700]   Man, that passage is quite powerful.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.580]   I don't know if we appreciate what that passage is saying.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.780]   I was looking at the way, I was trying to see the way that MacArthur, John MacArthur,
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:49.860]   would try to like describe and summarize all of this, but he doesn't.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.300]   This passage in 1 Peter verses 4 through 8 that I'm preaching, he preaches six sermons
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.300]   on that.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.620]   And I was like, "Great."
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:04.940]   But the running theme, which helped me a lot, is he said, "The magnitude of privilege."
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:12.500]   Get a sense of the magnitude of privilege when he says, "I am building you into a house."
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.580]   And if we get that, then we get the thrust of that emphasis there.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.620]   That while you are suffering and you're sitting here thinking, "Oh, we're not making much
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.620]   of anything.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.620]   You talking about a house?
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.620]   I don't have a house."
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.620]   Right?
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:30.220]   You're talking about a place to serve, a place to do X, Y, and Z.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.700]   I don't have any of that.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.260]   And he's saying, "But God has been building you all up for this.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.940]   And even while you're suffering, He's still working powerfully."
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.380]   That's what he's saying.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.340]   And the privilege continues to just mount up and stack up.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:49.300]   I just listed a few, but the greatest privilege of all is we're being built together and what
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:53.100]   we are going to be is a glorious temple.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:59.180]   I mean, all the flashbacks, so to speak, if the audience, some of them were Jews, and
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:03.620]   he speaks a lot in almost like Jewish reference to Old Testament passages and whatnot.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.620]   And I'm assuming a lot of the people he's talking to are Jewish people who converted
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.020]   to Christianity.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:14.020]   And immediately as he's saying this, they should think back to the glory of the temple.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:17.380]   The temple was an immensely sacred place.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.180]   You know that.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.780]   Nobody would dare tread the ground in the temple.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.180]   You risk your life.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.980]   God showed the Israelite nation, "You don't just approach me because my presence is holy
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.620]   and the access restricted."
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:39.420]   But he says, "Not only do you have access, you together become the dwelling place of
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.660]   His very presence."
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.660]   Wow.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:48.860]   The magnitude of privilege for those who have Christ.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.260]   And in this, he says, "God is doing to you."
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.700]   The work that God is doing is a divine work that He is accomplishing.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.820]   Now, I want to go back to this idea, and I'm going to reference it a lot, that the people
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.820]   are suffering.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:09.140]   So I'm sure it was tough for Apostle Peter to preach this in some sense because, again,
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:13.100]   somebody is going to say like, "Nah, I don't see it."
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.100]   Right?
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.660]   "I don't see it."
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:22.820]   And so that's why the next verses following, Apostle Peter gives a proof, confirmation
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.820]   and evidence.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.100]   You don't believe God is still working even though you're suffering?
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:33.420]   You don't believe God has not just simply a wonderful plan, but incredibly powerful,
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.940]   transformative plan to build the people of God up as a holy priesthood.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:44.220]   And later on, you read in verse 9 that you're going to be this chosen nation, a royal priesthood,
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.540]   holy nation, proclaiming the excellencies of God.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.900]   God has a significant role for His people.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.420]   Well let's take a look at that proof that I'm mentioning.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:08.020]   So we're looking down, going back to 1 Peter, and we'll read verse 6 and 7.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.380]   So he says, "For this is contained in Scripture.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:19.060]   Behold, I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious cornerstone, and he who believes in Him will
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.060]   not be disappointed.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.420]   This precious value then is for you who believe."
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:30.620]   So as we look at that, he says, as a proof, "You don't believe me?
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:34.140]   It was written in Scripture long ago before I ever told you."
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.140]   Right?
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.880]   And what he's referring to specifically is the book of Isaiah.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.860]   So please turn your Bible over to the book of Isaiah, chapter 28.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.700]   There are times when I wish that we were all Jewish.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.340]   Why?
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:56.300]   Because there's an element to which ingrained into the Jewish culture is a kind of repetition,
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:05.180]   educational process where you're taught by way of ritual, habit, memory, sacrifice, and
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.620]   all of that, where you're taught to appreciate some of these truths.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.860]   Right?
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:16.640]   So we're going to get to that idea in a little bit, but I'm going to ask several questions
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.980]   before we read this.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.660]   And some of these questions are this.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:26.760]   We just read a moment ago that he is laying this cornerstone down.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.560]   We read also in verse 4 that there is this living stone that we're coming to.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.100]   How would the Jewish people receive that if we were to be raised in their culture and
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.980]   we had all that education and all that upbringing?
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.260]   How would we receive that truth?
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:47.660]   Well, let's take a look at Isaiah 28 in verse 14 through 17.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:54.420]   He says this, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers who rule his people
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.260]   in Jerusalem.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.700]   Because you have said, 'We have made a covenant with death and Sheol, we have an agreement.'
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.780]   When the overwhelming whip passes through it, it will not come to us.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.700]   For we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood we have taken shelter."
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.860]   Immediately we get the context.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.820]   You see, the prophet Isaiah, he had a difficult job.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.980]   He's preaching a very simple and short message.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.820]   Essentially it's this, "You're going to get judged."
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.740]   Wrath is coming, right?
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.660]   But unfortunately, the people scoffed.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:32.660]   The people who were especially even rulers of Jerusalem mocked and said, "No, not us."
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.700]   You see, us and the enemies, us and them, we're friends.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.700]   We're good.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.540]   That's what he's saying, right?
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.540]   No problem.
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:47.020]   And the false teachers would constantly say, "Peace, just take it easy, Isaiah."
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.620]   That's the way it was working.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.620]   Now let's move on.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.860]   He says this in verse 16, "Therefore, thus says the Lord God, 'Behold, I am the one who
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:33:02.140]   has laid a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious stone of a sure foundation.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:07.500]   Whoever believes will not be in haste, and I will make justice the line and righteousness
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:12.460]   the plumb line, and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overwhelm
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.460]   the shelter.'"
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:22.620]   In context, what's very interesting is that in Isaiah, this passage is a indictment.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.140]   It's warning.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.140]   It's judgment.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:30.380]   "I'm going to bring the stone, and everything in terms of your lies, your confidence that
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.140]   is not of God will be all done away with."
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:40.380]   So here and now, there's an interesting connection we have to ask for.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:45.660]   How does this passage prove that God is doing a mighty work in us?
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.480]   As a matter of fact, how is that passage really encouraging?
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.260]   How does this strengthen the Christians who are suffering?
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.900]   How does this all make sense?
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.540]   Well, let's talk about that a little bit here.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:08.220]   He says in the midst of this warning that, "I am the one who is going to lay a foundation."
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:16.100]   He is going to lay a stone, a tested and precious cornerstone, and it's going to be sure.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.540]   You know, my mind this whole week, because Pastor Peter hasn't been here, has been thinking
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.540]   nothing but building, new building stuff.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.460]   I'd literally at night be like, "Oh my gosh, did I remember to do this?
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.460]   Did I remember to do that?
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:30.620]   Oh, what did it say on the blueprints?"
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.460]   And so I've been looking at architectural blueprints and realizing, man, blueprints
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.460]   are incredibly important.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.460]   Why?
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.300]   Because when the expectant cousin's been like, "Drawings like this, and that looks
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.300]   off."
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.980]   That's the way it's been going.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.660]   The thing about it is when he says, "I lay this foundation," you can think of it like
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.140]   this.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:55.420]   He's laid down the architectural blueprint long ago, before he said in the New Testament
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:59.100]   through Peter that, "I am building this spiritual house."
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.820]   The first stone has been laid.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.820]   That's what he's saying.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:08.620]   If I'm going to try to encourage you that God had this already in mind, look how far
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.900]   back we can go.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:14.940]   Through the time of Isaiah, there's going to be a foundation that is done.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:20.260]   And upon this foundation, I'm going to build this spiritual house.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:26.100]   So as we think about this idea of the stone and the living stone and the cornerstone,
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:32.500]   the cornerstone is typically a big stone, much bigger than your typical other stones
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.740]   that the rest of the building is made of.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.340]   And that's going to set the line.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.220]   That's going to set the trajectory of the rest.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.220]   It's going to set how things are squared.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:47.180]   But synonymously, the way that the Jewish people understood this cornerstone, the living
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.180]   stone, was the foundation.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.460]   You want to hear something pretty crazy?
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:57.980]   Is that this idea of the foundation stone was so ingrained in the Hebrew and Jewish
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:03.300]   culture that people would synonymously refer to that as the presence of God.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.740]   Why?
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:11.260]   In the temple on Mount Moriah where King Solomon's temple was built, okay, this is
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:17.580]   referenced in 2 Chronicles chapters 1 and 2, where the King Solomon's glorious temple
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:23.600]   was built, in the holy of holies, in that inner chamber, right, where no one really
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:31.220]   could go, the Ark of the Covenant rested on what's called the foundation stone.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:35.660]   That symbolically represented that God's presence was going to be here.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.420]   His seat of mercy was going to be here on the foundation stone that God has provided.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.820]   So what we learn is, God says, even while I'm pronouncing and foretelling of this judgment
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.780]   and warning, that he has selected a place.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:54.300]   He has set what is costly, precious, and valuable, set as a foundation for what he's going to
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.180]   do for all those who would trust in his name.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.380]   That's pretty amazing to me.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:07.980]   Now by way of connecting it even more, let's turn our Bibles to Psalm chapter 118.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.580]   Psalm 118, verses 22 to 27.
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:18.260]   This Psalm is very important because the Psalms from chapters about 116 to chapter 120, these
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:23.300]   are the Psalms that people regularly memorize to recite during festivals.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:28.860]   So Yom Kippur, you know, if you guys heard of Rosh Hashanah, the calendar year for the
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.220]   new year for the Jews, the Jewish calendar, and the day of atonement.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:38.520]   In all of these festivals, they had regularly, you know, kind of ritualistic liturgy, reciting
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.520]   of the scriptures.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.940]   Psalm 118 was one of them.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.340]   Do you know what they repeated every year?
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.620]   This is what it reads.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:52.420]   The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.220]   This is the Lord's doing.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.360]   It is marvelous in our eyes.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.500]   This is the day that the Lord has made.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.140]   Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.700]   Save us, we pray, O Lord.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.700]   O Lord, we pray, give us success.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.860]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.060]   We bless you from the house of the Lord.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.380]   The Lord is God and he has made his light to shine upon us.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.940]   Bind the festal sacrifice with cords up to the horns of the altar.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.060]   Why do I bring this passage up?
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:27.700]   Because I'm saying there's this concept of the foundational stone, synonymously cornerstone.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.060]   How is this encouraging?
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.060]   How does this help?
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.900]   Because it provides an incredible hope for the presence of God.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:40.260]   For the nation of Israel, when they were reciting these psalms of the cornerstone to come, how
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.820]   marvelous that day would be.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:48.460]   To them, they were anticipating with great eagerness, the Messiah.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.900]   If you guys remember on the triumphal entry, the passion week of Christ, right?
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.740]   When he's entering into Jerusalem, over a million people are gathered and everybody's
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.740]   laying down their psalms.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.740]   You know what they say?
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.500]   They say, "Save us, save us, Hosanna, Hosanna."
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.780]   They say, "Great and blessed is the one who comes from the Lord in the name of the Lord."
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:11.300]   They're essentially saying, "This could be the Messiah."
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:18.180]   They had that kind of anticipation for the concept of the foundational stone.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:23.420]   To them, for us, when we read 1 Peter, it's like, "And you're coming to this living stone
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.980]   and this living stone was built and you're kind of like, 'Okay, I get it.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.420]   We're supposed to be a building.'"
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:32.980]   To the Jewish people, this was all their lives' anticipation.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.060]   This was their great expectation.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:39.860]   One of the questions we have to ask ourselves is this.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:44.660]   Part of the reason why I said earlier, "I wish we were Jewish," is because there always
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:49.020]   has to be a growing appreciation for Christ in our lives.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:53.180]   Do you have a great expectation for Christ?
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.140]   Another way to put it is, do you have a great anticipation for Christ by which what you
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:03.060]   are longing for, what you believe is going to fill you, the solution to their ... For
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:08.940]   them, it was the solution to all of their both religious, their economical, and government
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.940]   woes.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.460]   For us, as Christians, Christ is supposed to be our all in all, the very presence of
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.020]   God.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.260]   He provides access.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:25.380]   He provides the peace and in the book of Ephesians chapter two, he says, "He himself,
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:30.660]   he himself is the hope, the peace that is afforded to us."
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.700]   That's an important question to ask.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:38.980]   Are we looking for this precious living cornerstone as the way the people will receive it?
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:44.900]   But now, I want to quickly move to another, the back end of that application.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.940]   Because something strange has happened.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:51.660]   The Jewish people rightly were trained to anticipate the Messiah.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:56.300]   But then, after they had sung all those Hosanna songs and said, "Oh, here comes the son of
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   David.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.300]   Here's Hosanna, Hosanna.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.940]   Save us, save us," is what they're saying.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:01.940]   What happened?
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:06.060]   They quickly turned.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.820]   Rather than marveling then and saying, "How, what a marvelous savior we have," they quickly
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.060]   turned and now it's like, "Get rid of him.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.060]   Be gone."
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.540]   And they mocked him.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.340]   And they beat him.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.340]   They spit on him.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.020]   And then ultimately, they cried out for his crucifixion.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.620]   What in the world is that?
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.620]   How could that happen?
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.860]   Well, in the intro, I talked about expectations.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.660]   I also talked about disappointment.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:39.660]   You see, there is a skewed expectation, if we're not careful, that we are all susceptible
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.500]   to.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.740]   What am I talking about?
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:50.900]   You see, God has given his son as an immense treasure and precious value to us who need
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:59.300]   life, who need a savior, who need light and truth, who need grace and peace.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.300]   But if that's not what we're looking for, what good is he to us?
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.700]   You see, in this story, or not in the story, in this analogy metaphor that Apostle Peter
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:12.700]   is giving in chapter two, there is two buildings being built.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.420]   There is one, the spiritual house of God, the household for the holy priest.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.820]   There is another builder, or the builders, who are building their own religion, their
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.740]   own system, and their own lives.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.940]   If that's what you're building, what good is this stone to you?
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.980]   It's just a piece of stone.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.900]   We have to be careful in terms of what we're anticipating and expecting from God, that
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.300]   it is not skewed, so that all of a sudden we're like, "Hey, Hosanna!"
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.900]   And then it's like, "Oh, what?"
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.980]   And you're so disappointed.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.820]   Now he becomes a hurdle for you to step over to get what you want.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:51.980]   And that's why in this passage, in 1 Peter chapter two, he'll say, "To those who believe,
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.020]   this is precious value.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.020]   It's for you.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:59.460]   But for those who disbelieve," look at this in verse seven, "the stone which the builders
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:08.020]   rejected, this became the very cornerstone and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense."
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:14.380]   Depending on the skewed perspective of our expectations, we're going to be so disappointed
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.940]   in Christ, he becomes a stumbling block for us.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:25.500]   Now, in order to get another sense of the idea here, we're going to take a look at where
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.020]   this quotation comes from.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.780]   Apostle Peter quotes actually three different passages in just verses six through eight.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.740]   But that last part about the stone becoming a stumbling block and a rock of offense comes
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.940]   from Isaiah chapter eight, verses 11 through 15.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:44.420]   So let's go there to follow the paper trail of how he's been quoting these passages in
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.180]   some of the context that's come there.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.620]   Okay?
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:54.300]   So so far as you go there, we've had number one, God has a plan to build you up as a spiritual
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   household.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:01.860]   Number two, Jesus Christ, the cornerstone is a proof of that plan.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.220]   I don't think I said that, huh?
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.860]   Sorry for those of you guys who have to take notes and you need it in order.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.900]   I gave it to you at the end.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:15.460]   Number two is Jesus is a cornerstone, proof of God's plan.
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.820]   Okay?
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.500]   Here's number, Isaiah chapter eight, verses 11 through 15.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   And this is what he says.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.340]   "For the Lord spoke thus to me with strong hand upon me and warned me not to walk in
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:32.900]   the way of this people, saying, 'Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.900]   Do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:40.420]   But the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.540]   Let him be your fear.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.500]   Let him be your dread.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:50.740]   And all will come, sorry, and he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:56.240]   of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a stair to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.340]   And many shall stumble upon it.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:00.260]   They shall fall and be broken.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.940]   They shall be stared and taken."
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:02.940]   Okay.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:10.500]   So, what we have is an interesting passage in Isaiah, where again he's rebuking the people.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.060]   But as he's rebuking the people, you get in context, he's like, "Don't think like they
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.060]   do.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.820]   Don't have this worldview where the greatest thing they fear is them.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.180]   And like sorrow and just pain."
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.540]   And that's a challenge to us too.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.820]   Don't fear just like everybody else in the world fears.
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:33.420]   For people in the world, their worst case scenario is, "I don't get the job of my dreams
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.180]   and I'm stuck at a cubicle job that I hate."
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.220]   The fear of the world is, "I just don't get to travel."
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.220]   I don't know.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.340]   Whatever the fear of the world may be, don't think like them.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:49.140]   And he says, "Let the one you fear be him, the Lord of hosts, and honor him.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.740]   Regard him as holy."
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.280]   That's what this passage is saying, right?
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.240]   But then he gives this interesting, what I like to call, fork in the road.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:05.420]   He says, "And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling."
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.420]   Right?
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.580]   So he says, "Do this.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.620]   Fear him, honor him, regard him as holy.
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:15.580]   And he will be a sanctuary and he will be a stumbling block."
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.380]   There's a fork in the road.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:21.220]   And I want to give a challenge to you, just as Apostle Peter is giving a challenge to
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.500]   the people.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.460]   He says, "There is this precious value and then there is this scary warning.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.100]   There is a fork in the road.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.900]   The benefits of having God as your sanctuary, the benefits of having Christ as your solid
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:38.220]   ground and foundation, the benefits of having Christ as your cornerstone, these things can
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.060]   only be experienced if you persevere in faith."
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.500]   I imagine Apostle Peter saying, "I hear that some of you, because of the persecution you're
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.180]   experiencing, might be tempted to say, 'Forget it.
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.260]   All I have to do is, I'm not a Christian no more.'"
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.260]   Right?
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.900]   "All I have to do to not be persecuted is like, 'I'm not Christian.'"
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.420]   And then turn around and go, "I just read my Bible in private."
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.420]   Right?
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.420]   That's what you would have to do.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.900]   But he says, "No, there is this fork in the road.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.220]   You can't have both.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:12.940]   You can't seek safety from all the persecution, provisions for every life circumstance, and
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.900]   yet at the same time expect all the provisions, privileges, the great magnitude of privileges
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.460]   of God, while having both scenarios in your favor."
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.020]   Brothers and sisters, there's a fork in the road.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:29.820]   A lot of us, in this day and age, defer the fork in the road.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:37.180]   Every single one of us, because of life circumstances, get tested in our faith, and some of us respond
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:42.020]   to the Word of God, the Gospel, and sometimes the commands that we know to be true in different
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.020]   fashion.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.980]   Some of us really know that we should surrender certain sins.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.140]   Some of us really know that we should start committing to the things that we know are
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.180]   priorities in the Scripture.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.460]   But then we start to delay and drag our feet.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.860]   There is a fork in the road.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:58.860]   What do I mean?
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:02.940]   We believe maybe, especially if you're young, I'm going to take it more seriously and do
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.660]   that later on.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.980]   We believe maybe, I'll give you kind of excuses wise, I don't know enough, I need to learn
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:12.220]   better, so I'm just going to do that stuff later when I know more.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.740]   Whatever may be the case, that is not an option.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.740]   What am I saying?
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.740]   I hope I'm making sense here.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.700]   What am I saying?
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:24.780]   According to 1 Peter, you're either rejecting Christ or you're standing on the solid rock
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.860]   of Christ.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:32.260]   If you drag your feet, if you defer your decision, that's not obedience.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.900]   For those of you guys who have kids, when you ask your child, "Hey, go pick up your
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:45.140]   toys," and your kid goes, "Ahhhhhh," or you're like, "Good job obeying," you know, "Can you
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.100]   please just move a little faster?"
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.100]   No.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.300]   Why are you not obeying me?
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.660]   If your child is sitting there and then you ask him, "Eat your food."
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.660]   What are you doing?
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.700]   I'm trying to decide.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.700]   Do you commend him?
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.700]   "Well, good.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.140]   I'm glad you're thinking about it."
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:06.140]   No, that's rejection of your command.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:11.260]   We think that by deferring, by putting stuff off, maybe just, I don't know, saying ignorance,
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.820]   I didn't hear that, I don't know, that is not an option.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.820]   There's a fork in the road.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.500]   You're either going to run to the sanctuary of God or you're going to reject him.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.060]   And there's a warning for all of us who do that, especially I'm speaking to those of
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.940]   you who are on the fence because I know.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:29.380]   I've counseled a lot of people this year who I feel like they're wrestling in their faith
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.580]   and they don't know what they ought to do.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.060]   There is a fork in the road.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.980]   You cannot delay your decision.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.740]   You cannot.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.020]   And there is an exhortation for us here.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.940]   See the choices.
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:47.620]   There are the builders who see Christ as worthless because of whatever personal ambition, because
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:49.980]   of whatever things are desirous for you.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:57.340]   And then there are those who trust and all of a sudden this honor, this joy is theirs.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.280]   You know something beautiful here?
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.380]   If you look, he talks about this stone that's precious in the sight of God.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.060]   It's choice, you know?
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:09.420]   It's like, mm, it's top tier, right?
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:15.940]   And then he says that this precious value is yours then through faith.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.780]   Some of your other translations will say this honor.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:23.860]   And then he gives this promise that those who believe in him, they will not be disappointed.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.340]   Some of your translations say they will not be hastened.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.140]   In the Hebrew what it means is like getting all riled up and excited, but then that's
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.140]   it, right?
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:36.220]   You're just like, so what he's saying is you're not going to be all stirred up for nothing.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.060]   Your great expectations are going to be met.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.860]   You'll never be let down.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.500]   This is amazing to me.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.820]   In the midst of suffering, in the midst of pain, Apostle Peter is saying, don't you worry,
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.420]   Christ will never disappoint you.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:52.980]   Wow, what conviction Apostle Peter has.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.340]   But on the flip side, there's the warning.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.180]   And I want to give you this challenge and warning right now.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:06.220]   If you defer your decision, delay your heart, give excuses, and you try to dodge the desires
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.780]   of God, you will harden your heart.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:12.300]   And when your heart is hardened, there is no turning back.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.140]   Let me show you how hard your heart can get.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:26.340]   If you turn in your Bibles to Matthew chapter 21, verses 42 through 45, this is the time
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:36.260]   when Jesus is interacting with Pharisees and scribes.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.300]   And as you turn there, I decided just right now to kind of go backwards.
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:45.300]   I want you guys to first imagine with me, you are the Jewish person in Jesus's day.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.220]   You're like 35, 40.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.140]   You've been learning the scriptures all your life.
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.980]   You memorize Psalm 118.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.500]   You memorize the Isaiah passage.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:56.500]   You memorize Psalm 120, all kinds of stuff, talking about here's this cornerstone.
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:57.820]   Remember that this is the glorious day.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.420]   What a glorious day and marvelous time this is.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.180]   You know, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.820]   He's coming, you know.
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.380]   You memorize all that.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.700]   And you recite that every single year during Passover.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:13.140]   And then here and now, there is this stir in the whole city.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.620]   This could be it.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:15.620]   This could be the Messiah.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:20.280]   You know, so just imagine with me how much like exhilaration, anticipation, and all that's
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.260]   in your heart, you know.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:30.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
