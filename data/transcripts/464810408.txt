[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.800]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.500]   Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.400]   I'm going to be reading verses 1 and 2, but actually I want
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.900]   to read it starting from verse 35 just
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.700]   so that we understand his thought flow that got us
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700]   to chapter 11, okay?
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.200]   So I want to read it in context of verse 35 all the way
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.300]   to chapter 11 verse 2.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.600]   Okay. Again, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   "Therefore do not throw away your confidence
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.800]   which has a great reward, for you have need of endurance
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.500]   so that when you have done the will of God,
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.300]   you may receive what was promised.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.400]   For yet in a little while, he who is coming will come
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.000]   and will not delay, but my righteous one shall live
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.100]   by faith, and if he shrinks back,
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.300]   my soul has no pleasure in him.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.800]   But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.400]   but of those who have faith to the persevering of the soul.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.800]   Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.300]   the conviction of things not seen.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.400]   For by it, the men of old gained approval."
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.700]   Let's pray.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.400]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would ordain this time
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.700]   to exalt yourself, your son, Holy Spirit, in your word.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.800]   Help us, Lord, to open our ears that we may understand, apply,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.500]   and to be obedient to all that you have given us.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.400]   Open our eyes that we may see a greater sight of your glory,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.800]   that all that we do, Father God, may lead
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.200]   to a greater honor to your name.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.800]   So we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.900]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.900]   Let me ask you, how many of you guys have been following the
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.400]   NBA finals?
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.900]   Okay, I heard the ratings have been down tremendously,
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.200]   but you know, obviously, if you've been a Lakers fan
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   for a while, we haven't been here in a while.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.400]   So it's exciting to see what's going on, but you know,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.700]   I don't know if you've noticed, but one of the things
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700]   that they've been doing in order to gain an edge
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   and to be motivated, you know,
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.100]   how they've been wearing the Mamba jerseys,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.600]   the black Mamba jerseys, and then so after they win a game,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.900]   they would ask, "Do you think, you know,
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.700]   that motivated you, that had any effect?"
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.500]   And they would say, "Yeah, you know, like the spirit of Mamba
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.400]   was with us, and we were, you know, extra motivated,
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.700]   you know, we want to make him proud."
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.600]   And I don't know if you saw this video clip,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   but there's a video clip going around where, I think it was
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.200]   from the Lakers Nation, where there's a video
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.100]   of LeBron James scoring 81st point at the third quarter,
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.400]   and the time on it is exactly 8.24.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.800]   So if you're not a Lakers fan,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.700]   you may not know what that means.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.400]   And if you don't watch sports at all,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.700]   what do these numbers mean?
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.300]   But I think if you guys are avid Lakers fan,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   like those of you guys who have smiles on your faces know exactly
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.000]   what I'm talking about.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.100]   Eighty-one was Kobe Bryant's highest scoring game
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.400]   that he had during his career against the Raptors.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.800]   And then 8.24 was the number that he wore.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.900]   Eight was the number he wore when he first came in,
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.400]   and 24 was the number that he wore before he retired.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.500]   And so they were making a big deal about, you know,
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   the Mamba's presence was with us,
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.400]   and it was 81 points at 8.24.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.800]   And they would ask, you know, do you think Mamba had anything?
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.100]   Do you think he's in the building?
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.600]   And the players would, you know, players who are loyal
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.900]   and love Kobe would say, yeah, I believe.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.600]   You know, I believe his presence was with us.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.100]   I believe that he's helping us, right?
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.700]   He's helping us getting to the end of the finals.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.900]   Obviously, we don't believe that, or we're not Christians, right?
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.500]   But what is faith?
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.100]   Because that term faith is being used, you know,
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.800]   in the culture where it's about winning ball games or, you know,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.900]   about, you know, having Kobe in the presence and helping us out.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.700]   But what is the idea of faith?
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.800]   Because the chapter we're going to be looking at
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.200]   for the next month and a half is, it's all about faith.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.100]   We're going to be on the subject about faith for about six weeks
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.200]   or possibly even longer than that.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.700]   Twenty-four separate times, just in one chapter,
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.100]   the word faith is mentioned, 24 times.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.900]   In fact, in almost every verse, almost every verse
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   or almost every paragraph starts by saying, by faith.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.700]   By faith, Noah. By faith, Joseph.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.400]   By faith, Abraham. By faith, Enoch.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.900]   And so the whole chapter is about faith.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.500]   If we say, what is a chapter of love, right?
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.100]   I think most of you would know, right?
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.800]   First Corinthians chapter 13, we typically say that's a chapter of love.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.400]   So if you want to know the definition of love,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.500]   then you go to First Corinthians chapter 13.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.900]   On the flip side, if you want to know about faith,
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.200]   this is the chapter that you need to go to, right?
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.500]   Again, it's not comprehensive.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.600]   Not everything that you need to know about faith is written in this chapter,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.700]   but this is a go-to chapter if you want to do an exposition
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.800]   of what the meaning of the faith is.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   Now, having said that, we can't emphasize enough,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.400]   we can't stress enough how important it is for us
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.700]   to not only understand this faith, but to be practicing this faith.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.400]   Obviously, because you wouldn't be saved without faith.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.900]   We wouldn't be here. There is no Christianity without faith.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.600]   There is no salvation without faith.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.200]   You cannot win a spiritual battle without faith.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   In fact, during Jesus' ministry,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.800]   he would see different people, and whether they were doing great works,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.700]   or whether they were anxious,
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.900]   he would always describe it as having great faith, or little faith,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.600]   or having no faith, and that's how he distinguished people.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.700]   He distinguished people by saying, "You have faith, you have no faith,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.900]   you have little faith, you have great faith."
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.300]   And so that's how God saw people,
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.100]   because that's what connected these people to him.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.700]   So, what we're going to be endeavoring in chapter 11
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.800]   is as crucial as any other thing that we've been studying.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.900]   But understand, again, the reason why I read the last part of chapter 10
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.600]   is to give you the context of why chapter 11 is here.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.400]   The purpose of chapter 11 is not simply to give us the idea,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.000]   or theology, of faith.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.300]   The goal of it is, "Oh, this is so important,
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.800]   you need to be able to pass this test."
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   So, if somebody asks you what faith is,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.600]   that you're able to quote verse 1. That's not his point.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.900]   He was saying at the end of chapter 10,
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.700]   that you have need to endure.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.900]   You need to endure, because the righteous shall live by faith.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.400]   And so the goal of chapter 11
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.400]   is the accumulation of all the arguments that he's been making in 10 chapters.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.700]   That you are not enduring, you are drifting, you're not paying attention.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.000]   And if you aren't paying attention, and you think it's no big deal,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.500]   it's that there's a severe judgment that is waiting to take it seriously.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.200]   But once you've done that, and you recognize where you are,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.700]   realize that the only way that you're going to be able to persevere
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.100]   is to have enduring faith.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.000]   You need to recognize what faith is,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   and be connected to God, and persevere by this faith.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.300]   And so chapter 11 is very practical.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.600]   So he's going to give us the definition of faith,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.100]   in what we're looking at today,
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.900]   and then how that was played out in Israel's history.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.400]   And then based on that, he's going to go to chapter 12,
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.100]   in view of the cloud of witnesses,
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.000]   that were saved by faith, that lived by faith, that died by faith,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.900]   now let us do the same.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.800]   And so that'll take us to chapter 12, and to the rest of the book of Hebrews.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.100]   So again, I want you to understand what we're doing in the context of where we're at.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.700]   So today, I want to look at just the first two verses,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.600]   and there's three things that I want to highlight in this text,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.800]   before we move on to the other part.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.700]   One is, it'll tell us what faith is.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.100]   That's our first point, what is faith?
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.300]   And it's pretty clear, right? Faith is.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.400]   The second point of it is, what faith is not.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   That's not clearly in the text, but we wanted to make sure,
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.000]   in order for us to clearly understand what faith is,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.500]   we also need to know what faith is not.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   And then third, what faith does.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.200]   And that will take us to the rest of the verses in chapter 11.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   So what faith is, what faith is not, and what faith does.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.900]   So let's look at the first part, what faith is.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.100]   First and foremost, faith is tangible.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.800]   That was the last question that I asked, if you're on the Facebook,
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.900]   and you look at, and again, hopefully, some of you guys are,
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.900]   more and more of you guys are looking at that before you come to service,
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.300]   because it will help you to be better listeners,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.300]   intentional listeners of the sermon.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.400]   But one of the questions that I asked is,
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.000]   is faith tangible or intangible?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.400]   So the answer to that, at least according to this text,
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.100]   is that faith is tangible.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.900]   Let's look at verse 1.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.300]   "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.300]   and the conviction of things not seen."
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.600]   Most of your translations have something to that effect.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.900]   It is the assurance of things hoped for.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.800]   And then it is the conviction of things not seen.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.600]   Well, I asked you to compare the translation of those words
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.100]   in the King James and New King James versus the NASB.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.000]   I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand to tell me if you did it or not,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.500]   because I don't want to be discouraged.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.000]   Maybe I'll be encouraged, but I don't want to take the chance.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.900]   The difference between the New King James or King James versus the NASB
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.600]   is that in the NASB, this is how it's translated.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.200]   "Faith is the substance of things hoped for,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.700]   and the evidence of things not seen."
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.700]   Do you hear the difference?
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.900]   Let me read it in NASB, and then I'm going to read it in King James.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.000]   "Faith is"—this is the NASB—"assurance of things hoped for,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   and the conviction of things not seen."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.700]   That's the NASB.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.500]   The King James version says, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.600]   and the evidence of things not seen."
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   Did you catch the difference?
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.300]   Okay, well, if you didn't, I'm going to explain.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.800]   If you read it in the NASB, it sounds like a subjective application of what faith does.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.500]   So faith is—through faith, I have assurance.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.500]   Through faith, I have conviction.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.700]   That's how we read it in the NASB.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.100]   In the King James, it says, "Faith is the substance,
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.000]   and it is the evidence of things not seen."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.700]   Do you catch the difference?
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.800]   In the NASB, there is a subjective application of faith.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:12.300]   In the King James, it just describes the truth, an objective truth of what it is.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.800]   Did you get it?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.900]   Okay, even if you didn't get it, this is what we're going to be talking about today.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.300]   If you read the NASB, it just reads it very plainly in English.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.200]   This is what faith—it's just describing what faith is.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.100]   In the NASB, it describes what faith does.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.100]   Right? Okay, let me just leave that right there.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.800]   Which is the correct translation?
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.300]   Well, the literal translation almost always is the King James version,
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:47.800]   because the King James version did not make much effort to try to translate into our—the way we speak.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.400]   NASB did some.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.500]   So if something didn't make sense in English,
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.900]   they did the extra work of trying to use words that you and I are familiar with.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.200]   King James didn't care.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.400]   King James just kind of took what is in the Greek,
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   and if that's what it says, they just translated it.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.900]   So sometimes—you know, a lot of times, King James is hard to read,
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.900]   because that's not the way we speak normally, right?
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:16.100]   But if you want to know literally, word for word, how it is said in the Greek,
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:21.600]   King James is—almost always has done that.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:29.400]   And though having said that, the word for assurance in Greek is "hupostasis."
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.000]   And it is—the literal understanding of the "hupo" means to be under.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.200]   "Stasis," it means to stand.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.000]   So the literal understanding of this is to "substance."
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.900]   Did you get that?
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.600]   Because under, "sub," and then "stasis," it means to stand.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   So the literal understanding is "substance."
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:01.000]   So the King James says, in translation of "hupostasis," "substance."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.900]   "Substance."
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:09.400]   Which was basically, "substance" is the stuff that you stand on.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.300]   Whatever it is that you're building, it is the foundation in which something is built.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:20.500]   So the literal understanding of what faith is, just like we said earlier,
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:27.700]   faith—everything that you and I know about Christianity stands on the foundation of this faith.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.800]   That's what he means.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.900]   Faith is the substance of things hoped for, things that we desire about Christ.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.900]   Everything that he promised, we stand on that faith.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.900]   And then it is the evidence of the things that we don't see.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.400]   It is the proof of things that we do not see.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.600]   So why did the NASB translate it that way?
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.300]   Well, the reason why is because the word "hupostasis," used in other parts of the Bible,
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.400]   is used either way depending upon the context.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:09.200]   So in some contexts, this word is used subjectively to refer to assurance, having confidence.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   And then there are some places where it's strictly just talking about the objective truth of something.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.800]   It is the evidence. It is the proof of something.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.500]   So the New Testament context doesn't help.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.400]   So if that context doesn't help, we have to look at the smaller context.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.100]   How does the author use it in the book of Hebrews?
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.500]   Well, we have a problem with that because there's only a couple places where he uses it.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:37.400]   And in those places, one uses it subjectively, one uses it objectively.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.500]   So that doesn't help.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:44.400]   So if we look at the immediate context of how he uses it here,
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.600]   and you have to understand, he's taking where we are in the book of Hebrew.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.800]   I hope this isn't too early.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.500]   I hope you're in the student mode.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:01.500]   Because what's happening in chapter 11 is he took 11 chapters of doing what?
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:10.200]   Proving the superiority of Christ, of the objective truth that Christ is superior to everything that you know.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.000]   So he's been setting the foundation, correct?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.300]   He said, this is our faith.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.200]   You've been drifting away from faith.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.500]   You've been drifting away from Christ.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.800]   So he's been talking about objective faith.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.100]   Now he goes to chapter 11. What is chapter 11 about?
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.800]   The application of that faith, right?
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:39.600]   So we're right in the middle of taking the objective truth and then applying it to our lives.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   And he begins by giving us examples of the men and women who went before us in the Old Testament,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.300]   how this objective truth was applied subjectively in their lives.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.200]   And then once he transitions, he gets to chapter 12,
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.700]   and he's going to tell us, what does this faith look like in your life?
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.800]   You follow?
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.200]   So having said that, which is it? Is it objective? Is it subjective?
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   And the answer to that is both.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   Because without the objective faith, there is no subjective application.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.600]   And we happen to be right at that transition.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.100]   So let me go a little bit further, talking about what this means.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:28.600]   It is the substance of things hoped for. It is the evidence of things not seen.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.700]   In other words, he's saying, I've been telling you all this stuff about who Jesus is,
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.100]   but faith is tangible. It's not intangible.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.100]   It's not just something that people say, it's like, you know, I have faith in this and I have faith in that.
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.800]   He says, no, faith can actually be measured.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.100]   And that's why Jesus looked at what was happening in the New Testament during his era.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.700]   He said, you have little faith, you have great faith, you have no faith.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.900]   So he was measuring faith.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:17:00.300]   And so he says, faith can be observed. It is the substance. It is the evidence.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.100]   We've been studying Thessalonians.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.500]   In Thessalonians, Paul sends Timothy back because he was chased out of that town,
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.300]   and he was worried that they were going to backslide because of all the enemy's work.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.900]   Timothy comes back with a good report. Remember what he says?
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:26.500]   He says that we rejoice because your faith has become the model for all the other Christians, all the other churches.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.200]   Now, how did he know that? How did they know that they were thriving?
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   How did they know that he was becoming? Did he go there and count?
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.300]   How many of you believe? And then people raise their hands.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:42.900]   15, 16, last time it was 16, so this time we have 18. So he said, they're thriving.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.200]   More people raised their hand this time.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.400]   You know, I had an altar call and more people came.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.600]   Is that what he's describing? No.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.500]   He saw the tangible evidence.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.600]   He saw the tangible evidence of their faith and how it affected their life.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.400]   So when he said that they became a model citizen,
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.700]   he wasn't simply talking about a subjective feeling inside, a confession,
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.000]   like somebody confessed them more deeply, more articulately than before.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.900]   No, he was observing the application of their faith,
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.000]   and he saw that even in the midst of persecution and danger,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.300]   that their faith radically transformed them, that they were known for their love,
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.700]   that they didn't practice before.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:35.000]   So Paul, Timothy was observing tangibly what this faith looks like,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.100]   and he said they have great faith despite the persecution.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.600]   So when he says faith is the substance of things hoped for,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   that's what he's talking about.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.400]   It's not just intangible things because, you know, these guys who he's writing to,
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.500]   the author is writing to, were professing right doctrine,
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.200]   but their life was drifting back to their old life.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.800]   So the problem that he was addressing is you're professing with your mouth,
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.700]   but with your life you're drifting back to your old life.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:11.900]   So what he is saying in chapter 11 is you're professing objective truth,
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:19.900]   but true objective truth is tangibly seen by how it is applied in the life of a believer.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.100]   We do not believe that we are saved by our works,
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.600]   but works is evidence of our faith, whether it's little faith,
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.900]   whether it's sliding faith, or whether it's great faith, or whether there's no faith.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.600]   That's what he means here when he says faith is tangible.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.400]   It is a substance of things that we cannot tangibly see.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:49.300]   Now let me give you an illustration of this to better make sense of this.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.900]   Do you believe in gravity?
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:00.400]   If you don't, how did you survive all these years, right?
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:06.900]   So if you believe in gravity, okay, which I'm assuming 100% of you will say you believe in gravity,
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.100]   meaning that it exists and it works.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.500]   Prove it to me.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:21.600]   How will you prove gravity?
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.000]   This is proof.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.100]   Your chair, that's proof.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.700]   This building is proof. The car is proof.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.400]   Because without gravity, we wouldn't be stuck to the ground, right?
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.600]   It's not certain people who are heavier, you know,
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.200]   where we're stuck to the ground and everybody else is floating around.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:51.400]   He said we see the work of gravity by how everything else works.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.700]   How important is gravity?
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.400]   You and I can't live without gravity, right?
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.100]   If no one would build a building, no one would spend millions of dollars building a building
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:10.000]   if they weren't sure if that building was going to fly away into the galaxy.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.500]   Because that would be a waste of time.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.600]   So everything, whether you and I are conscious or not,
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.100]   everything is based on this belief that what we know,
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.400]   even though we can't explain it, even though we cannot see it,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.300]   exists and it works.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:36.600]   So this belief in gravity is the foundation upon which we build everything that we do in life.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   So faith is the substance of things that we hope for,
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.700]   and it is the evidence of things not seen.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.500]   Even though we can't see it, even though I can't clearly define it for you,
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:59.900]   it says you can see faith because everything that we know about the reality of heaven
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:05.500]   is based upon this truth of what Jesus has told us,
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.100]   that our sins are forgiven, that because of this,
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.100]   that when we die, we're going to be in eternity with Christ,
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.800]   that this earth is under condemnation,
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.600]   and we're going to be saved and be in heaven for eternity.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   And so everything that you and I do as Christians
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.500]   are based upon this set of truths that you and I believe,
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:32.100]   and faith is what connects us to this truth.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.700]   Okay, you understand that?
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.000]   That's what he's describing here.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.100]   And he's saying that this is what faith is.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.500]   Now having said that, I need to explain what faith is not.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.800]   Because the way that the word faith is used,
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.100]   even in the church sometimes, it confuses people.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:58.500]   Faith is not faith in faith.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.100]   Faith is not faith in faith.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:06.500]   So when LeBron James or whoever says, "Oh, I just believe,"
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.400]   there's no power in that.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.900]   Faith is not just wishful thinking.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.500]   If I just believe, finish this sentence.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.900]   If I believe I can...
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.100]   You guys are so Asian.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:27.200]   If I believe I can achieve, right?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.300]   You probably heard that before.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.800]   If I believe I can achieve.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.500]   And that is the mantra of the word faith movement.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.300]   That if you believe, you can do whatever.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.300]   So let's say if Lakers win,
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   which is the possibility is very high right now, right?
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.900]   If they win, you may hear an athlete
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:55.500]   who just won the championship and say, "I believed.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.800]   I believed.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.400]   Even when nobody believed in me, I believed.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.900]   Everybody said, you know, that the Clippers were going to win.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.000]   That Kawhi was the best player.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.200]   That we had no chance.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.400]   They didn't give us the odds, but we never stopped believing.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.700]   So we believed.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.800]   And because of their belief, they were able to win the championship.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.300]   That's if you believe, you can achieve.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.100]   Not only is that false, it's dangerous.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.900]   It can ruin your lives.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.200]   You ever watch American Idol?
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.300]   You have some people who come up there to compete in a competition
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.600]   that they have no business doing?
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.000]   For whatever the reason, I think as the years went by,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.900]   they got rid of more and more people who really don't belong there.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.900]   But some of you guys who remember,
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.800]   remember the beginning of that show, American Idol?
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.500]   There are some guys like, how did he get up there, right?
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.600]   Remember William Hung?
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.100]   Okay, let me pass.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.600]   Let me move on.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.300]   Some of you guys may remember, right?
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.600]   There are some guys, they couldn't even hit a note, you know?
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.100]   And they would come there and say, yeah, you know,
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.500]   they would say the same thing.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.800]   I was always told I'm no good and everybody tried to stop me.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.700]   My parents, they didn't believe in me.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.800]   But I believed in myself.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.000]   It's like, go ahead, William.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.200]   She banged, she banged.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.600]   And Simon Cowell was like, you suck.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.700]   And everybody said, he's so mean.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.800]   And we were looking at that, and we said, no, he's true.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.100]   He's like, you know, maybe the way he said it was mean, but that's true.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.300]   Just because you believe doesn't make your voice better.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.800]   Just because you believe, you're not going to achieve.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.400]   So the best thing that he, somebody should have told him.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.800]   Somebody should have told him that you're not gifted in that.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.900]   And in fact, you're really bad at this.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.100]   Should have been an engineer, right?
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.400]   I was like, what does that mean?
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.900]   No, it's the truth, right?
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:54.800]   So not only is it false, it's dangerous when it is applied in the wrong place.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.100]   That's not what faith means.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:03.200]   In fact, you and I live in a world where the word faith is used by politicians.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.000]   Oprah, Joel Osteen, Benny Hinn, LeBron James, Lancy Pelosi.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.300]   These are all people that I've heard in the last few months saying how faith is so powerful.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.100]   They're not talking about Christ.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.000]   They're not talking about his resurrection.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.800]   They're talking about faith in faith.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:29.200]   In fact, there's a lot of songs out there, secular songs, that have nothing to do with Christ,
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.600]   but they're talking about faith.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.800]   And you guys remember George Michael?
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   Okay, it's a little outdated.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.500]   Okay, so how about his band Wham?
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.800]   Anyway, okay, look it up.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.100]   He's real.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:51.500]   So a guy named George Michael, he had a song called, "You Gotta Have Faith."
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.000]   Anybody who knows George Michael knows he's not a Christian.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.900]   I'm not going to get into what he got caught doing and all that background stuff,
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.800]   but just trust me, he's not a Christian.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.700]   But he has a song called, "You Gotta Have Faith," and let me read you his lyrics.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.000]   "Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body."
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   He's not talking about the church.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.500]   "I know that everybody has got a body like you,
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.200]   but I gotta think twice before I give my heart away,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.700]   and I know all the games you play because I play them too.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.500]   Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion,
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.000]   time to pick my heart up off the floor.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.600]   Oh, when that love comes down without devotion,
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.700]   well, it takes a strong man, baby,
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:36.200]   but I'm showing you the door 'cause I gotta have faith, gotta have faith,
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.800]   because I gotta have faith, faith, faith, I gotta have faith, faith, faith."
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.900]   He's not talking about the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.200]   The way that the term "faith" is being used in our culture,
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.400]   it's like, "If you believe, you can achieve."
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.600]   He's not talking about that clearly.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.800]   It is not faith in faith that gives you power.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.600]   In fact, if you remember, in Luke 8, 11-15,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.000]   Jesus gives a parable of the sower and the seed,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.800]   and out of the four soils, only one soil endures and bears fruit.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.600]   The other three, either immediately dies, or after a little bit it dies,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.200]   or it looks like it's going to bear fruit, and then it gets choked, and it dies,
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.400]   but all three, in the end, it dies.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.600]   But the distinction between the one that lives and bears fruit—
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.100]   and he's talking about eternal life—
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:34.200]   versus those who seem to bear fruit and then they die is how they receive what?
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.600]   The seed.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.700]   What they did with the seed.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.900]   Because the seed is the Word of God.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.200]   And does the seed, when it lands on wherever you are,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.400]   does it bear fruit? Does it endure?
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.400]   So, that's what he means in Romans 10, 17.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:58.600]   It says, "So faith comes from hearing, and the hearing by the Word of Christ."
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.900]   So faith is not faith in faith. Faith is in what?
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.000]   His Word.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.600]   Faith comes from hearing of the hearing of the Word of Christ,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.200]   because faith is what connects us to the unseen.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.400]   And what is the greatest of the unseen? God himself.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.200]   So faith is the evidence of what we hope for.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:25.700]   It is a substance or evidence or proof of what is unseen, which is God himself.
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:31.600]   Some people ask me, "Why is your church so hooked on teaching the Bible,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.800]   memorizing Scripture, you know, expiatory preaching, and inductive Bible study?
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.900]   You know, what about homeless? What about this? And what about that?"
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.500]   It's not that those things don't matter.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:50.500]   But the Bible says that the central thing that connects us to God is faith.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:58.000]   Not your hard work, not organization, not older brothers, not good leaders.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.500]   He said it's faith. Faith is what connects you and makes things that aren't seen real.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.000]   So the greatest thing that you and I need to cultivate is faith.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And the way that we get faith, the way that the faith grows, is through what?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.300]   Hearing of the Word of Christ.
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.700]   And you may sit here and sit all your life, hear the Word of Christ,
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.000]   and not have any effect in your heart.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.400]   But no matter what you do the rest of your life, you're not standing on the right foundation.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.600]   That's why the Word of God is central.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.800]   Without the Word of Christ, it doesn't matter if you feed the poor.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:44.300]   Without the Word of Christ and our faith, it doesn't matter if we are doing social justice
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.800]   and whatever it is that we get involved in.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.400]   Because faith is what connects us to this living God.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:57.700]   John 10.27, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:03.700]   That's what he's been doing. He's been spending ten chapters establishing Christ as what?
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.900]   The foundation, the chief cornerstone.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.600]   And chief cornerstone in modern English just means it's foundation.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.100]   That Jesus is the foundation upon which we build everything else.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.800]   So if you drift away from Christ, it doesn't matter what you build.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.900]   It doesn't matter how hard you work. It doesn't matter how well you educate your kids.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:28.600]   If we drift away from the foundation, Christ is a chief cornerstone.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:34.700]   In 1 Peter 1.20-25, "For you have been born again, not of seed, which is perishable, but imperishable.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.400]   That is through the living and enduring Word of God.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.000]   For all flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of the grass.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.900]   The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the Word of the Lord endures forever.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.600]   And this is the Word which was preached to you."
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:56.900]   Everything else, every other foundation is going to dry up, is going to rot, is going to die.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.500]   But only what's built, our salvation, our sanctification, our glorification,
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.800]   that's built on the enduring Word of God will last forever.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   So in other words, enduring faith is what's connected to the enduring Word.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.700]   That's what he means.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.600]   So what faith is and what faith is not, and then thirdly, what faith does.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:27.200]   He says in verse 2, "For by it men of old gained approval."
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:33.500]   He says in verse 6, "Without faith it is impossible to please God."
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:39.500]   You can have knowledge, you can have passion, but he says without faith it is impossible to please God.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.400]   So he said this is what faith is, and here's all these people that I'm going to be mentioning,
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:49.400]   and it is by faith that they endured, they suffered, and even died.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.600]   And by doing so, they found approval before God.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:58.800]   In other words, when they died, God said to each one of them, "Well done, my good and faithful servant."
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.400]   Not simply because of hard work. Yes, faith caused them to have hard work.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   Faith caused them to sacrifice. Faith caused them to do crazy things for God.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:14.600]   But it was faith that caused them to work, not work.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:22.100]   Now, all of this is basically what he was trying to tell them in Hebrews chapter 10, verse 34.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.100]   He says, "For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.600]   knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one."
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.100]   And he's reminding them.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.600]   The reason why they were able to endure the first time when persecution came around,
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   and why now they're tempted to go back to their old life,
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.400]   is because when it first came, they were anchored in Christ.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.800]   And they were able to see that there's a better possession coming.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.100]   Even if all of this gets stripped away, all of this gets stripped away,
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:34:00.100]   he says, they saw clearly what was coming because of this faith.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.100]   Apostle Paul, that's what he means in Philippians when he says,
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:09.600]   "In comparison to the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ."
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.100]   The Bible says, "Satan blinds the mind of the unbelievers so they do not," what?
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.600]   "So they do not see." How was our eyes open? Through faith.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   So when faith caused us to see the eternal things as to be true, they had courage.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   And that's why Paul says, "In light of what I saw in Christ,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   everything that I knew here became rubbish in comparison."
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   So faith is what causes us to see that. Faith is what causes us to be connected to that.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.100]   And so he's trying to remind them to be re-anchored in Christ.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:53.100]   In Galatians 5.5, "For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything."
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.600]   Okay, let me stop right there.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:03.100]   How much time has Paul dedicated in the New Testament
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:08.100]   to describe that circumcision is not necessary?
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:13.100]   Is there a right and wrong with circumcision?
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.100]   Again, you guys are so Asian.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.100]   Yes. You can't be circumcised.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:26.600]   Paul, his whole second missionary journey was to go back to the churches and tell them,
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.100]   "You don't need to be circumcised."
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:38.600]   That's his whole argument. He rebukes Peter and Barnabas because they wouldn't sit with the uncircumcised.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   So is there a right and wrong answer with circumcision and uncircumcision?
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   Yes. Then why does he say that?
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.100]   Why does he say it doesn't matter whether circumcision or uncircumcision?
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:36:01.100]   Because even your talk of right theology, if it is not coming from faith, is useless.
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:07.600]   Even if you're theologically correct, if it's not faith, what does he say?
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:13.600]   He says, "But faith working through love."
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   If it is not your faith in Christ that is evidenced by how you love, even correct theology is useless.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   Did you catch that?
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.100]   That's why this faith is so important because it's the foundation upon which we build everything.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:36.100]   So right theology has to come from right faith working itself out through love
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.100]   and everything else is built on top of that.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.600]   1 Peter 1.7, "So the proof of your faith being more precious than gold,
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   which is perishable even through tested by fire,
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   That even in the midst of suffering, that when you endure it,
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:05.600]   it is proof that you are connected to the unseen, God himself.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   He's laying all of this as a foundation.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   This is how important faith is.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   This is how important being connected to Christ is.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.100]   This is how important not to drift.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.100]   And then he's going to show us what that looks like in the life of these believers.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:30.100]   Let me get practical and personal here for a minute in application.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:36.100]   The beginning of our salvation is faith, obviously.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.100]   But what is it of faith in?
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.100]   How do you start your relationship with God?
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.100]   If somebody off the street said, "You know, I want to be a Christian.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.100]   What do I do?"
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   What would you tell them?
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.100]   Go to church?
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:01.100]   "Oh, I know this guy, this small group. Join that small group."
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.100]   What would you tell them?
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:07.100]   I'm talking about the very genesis of someone's connection to God.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.100]   What would you tell them?
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:18.100]   "God died for you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for you to take away your sins.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.100]   And he was resurrected that you may have a new life.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:29.100]   So if you believe that he died for you and that your sins are forgiven because of what he has done,
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.100]   he says you will be forgiven."
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.100]   That's the genesis.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:38.100]   Now that will lead to teach them to observe all that I have commanded you, right?
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.100]   But the first action, first thing that somebody who said, "I want to be a Christian," is
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:50.100]   you need to confess and believe that Jesus forgave you of your sins.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:57.100]   But that's not the first and only time where that gets questioned.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.100]   Sometimes we do that.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.100]   It's like I raise my hand, I confess, and then we move on.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.100]   And there are many Christians living day to day in the process of sanctification
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:11.100]   having a hard time believing that Christ forgave you.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.100]   There are people, tons of people that I've met,
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.100]   who regurgitate what has happened in the past.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.100]   Maybe I'm struggling because of my sins.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.100]   Maybe these things are happening because I did this in the past.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:34.100]   How many times could God possibly forgive for the same sins over and over again?
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:39.100]   So even though we may profess it outwardly, inwardly,
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.100]   there's a doubt whether he really forgave me.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.100]   And because there's doubts of his forgiveness,
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:53.100]   that automatically trickles down to, "Does God really love me then?"
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:40:00.100]   And so when we try to live out our sanctification without doubt lingering over us,
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:06.100]   we have to prove ourselves to make sure that we are worthy of that love,
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.100]   which is an impossible task.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.100]   Not a hard task, an impossible task.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.100]   So the first and foremost thing that every Christian,
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.100]   from the beginning, in the middle, and at the end,
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.100]   that we need to have absolute confidence of,
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   is when Jesus says that if you confess your sins,
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:28.100]   he is faithful and just to forgive you of all your unrighteousness.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.100]   You have to believe that with all your heart.
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:36.100]   Because that's the only way that we have any connection
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:41.100]   to the eternal, to the unseen.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.100]   Your sins are forgiven.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.100]   Your sins are forgiven.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:53.100]   And when God says your sins are forgiven, he says it is forgotten.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:59.100]   He sees us as righteous because we're covered by the blood of Christ.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:03.100]   Jesus' righteousness was imputed in us, and that's what atonement is.
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.100]   We are covered by his blood.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.100]   So when he sees us, he doesn't see a failure
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.100]   who's trying to make up for his mistakes.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   He sees a sinner who could not,
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:20.100]   that his son had compassion and love and forgave.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.100]   That is the beginning point of our salvation.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.100]   It is like ongoing sanctification,
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:29.100]   and it is the only way that we can make it to glorification.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:39.100]   First and foremost, do you believe that you are forgiven?
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:47.100]   how will he not along with him freely give us all things?
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:51.100]   If you believe that Jesus died for your sins,
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:56.100]   how do you struggle with the fact that he would give you anything that you need?
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.100]   So many Christians, you know, accept that superficially
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.100]   and then wrestle the rest of our lives
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:06.100]   worrying that God's not going to care enough to take care of the things that I need.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.100]   You see how completely illogical that is?
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.100]   Not only is it not biblical, it's illogical.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.100]   It's illogical to believe that God would send his son
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.100]   but not care about your needs.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.100]   And that's exactly what he is saying.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.100]   He's saying trust him. Believe him.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.100]   Whatever trials may be coming, be anchored in Christ.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.100]   What caused you to begin your relationship with God,
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   continue to anchor with him so that you may persevere in your faith.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.100]   Then I want to wrap up with,
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:41.100]   because there are some of you who feel so weak in your faith,
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.100]   that you're just barely hanging on.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.100]   Especially with this pandemic, and I was reading the statistics
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.100]   of how many people have fallen out in their faith,
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:54.100]   they said over a third of people who were attending church at one point
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.100]   before the pandemic have walked away from their faith.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.100]   A third!
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.100]   I mean, you tell me,
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.100]   I mean, that's something spiritual.
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:07.100]   That's not something that any human being could have done.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:12.100]   And obviously from our perspective, we can see that as purification of the church,
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.100]   but from another perspective, that's satanic work.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.100]   Right?
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.100]   There are a lot of people who are barely hanging on.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   Jesus said that if you have a faith of a mustard seed, you can move mountains.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.100]   Have you ever seen a seed of a mustard seed?
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.100]   It's like a lint.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.100]   In fact, it's a lint of a lint.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.100]   That's how tiny it is.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:37.100]   You almost have to look at it and say, "What is that?"
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.100]   Because it's that tiny.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.100]   So Jesus was pointing to the smallest seed,
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.100]   and he said, "If you have a faith that tiny,
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.100]   you can move mountains."
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.100]   So what he means by that is, that's how powerful that is.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:57.100]   That tiny little faith that you have,
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.100]   that connects you to the Almighty God,
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:06.100]   that tiny little connection is more powerful than anything that you can think of.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.100]   And it is not that mustard seed.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.100]   The power is not in that seed.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:16.100]   The seed is the path that connects us to the Almighty.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.100]   That's what he means by that.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.100]   He's not saying you can move mountains.
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.100]   He says, "Through faith that connects you to this powerful God,
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.100]   he can move mountains."
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.100]   That's what that means.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.100]   Some of us are just hanging on a thread,
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.100]   for whatever the reason.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.100]   Maybe it was out of neglect.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:37.100]   Maybe you failed, and you have a hard time believing that God can possibly forgive you.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.100]   And you've drifted, and you've drifted, and you've drifted.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.100]   And it's so small.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:46.100]   They say, "Well, mustard seed, I feel like it's even smaller than that."
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.100]   My guess is if Jesus could point to something even smaller than a mustard seed,
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:54.100]   he would have pointed at that, because that was his point.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:45:00.100]   There are times when we hold on,
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.100]   even through that small seed.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.100]   Maybe some of you guys are out there right now.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.100]   Let me give you a powerful illustration of this,
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.100]   through the life of the disciples.
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.100]   Remember in John chapter 6, he feeds 5,000.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.100]   The actual number, probably 20,000.
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:23.100]   Remember, today, if you have a crowd of 100 people,
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.100]   that's a pretty big crowd.
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.100]   Let's say if you got off the airport, and you're coming through International,
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.100]   and there's 30 people with signs with your name on it.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.100]   What would we think?
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.100]   "Oh, he's important."
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.100]   What if there was 100 people?
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.100]   "Is this guy a movie star?"
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.100]   What if there was 1,000 people?
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.100]   "Is this the president?"
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.100]   What if there was 10,000 people?
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:48.100]   This is at LAX, where there's millions of people that live here.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.100]   This is in the rural side of Galilee.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.100]   20,000 people are following him everywhere he goes.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.100]   He just fed them.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.100]   So this is at the peak of Jesus' ministry, in John chapter 6.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:01.100]   And people are forgetting to feed their kids.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.100]   They're following him wherever he goes.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.100]   Remember the mindset of the disciples.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.100]   The disciples were constantly wondering, when the kingdom comes,
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.100]   who's going to be the greatest?
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.100]   They didn't understand what Jesus came to do.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.100]   Or they didn't fully understand.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.100]   They knew him, but Jesus would say, "I'm going to go to the cross.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.100]   I'm going to die."
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.100]   He said, "Who's going to sit on your left?
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.100]   Who's going to sit on the right?"
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.100]   That's all they could think of.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:31.100]   So imagine 20,000 people following their master wherever they go,
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.100]   and they're the right-hand men.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.100]   My guess is, every time the disciples stepped out, it's like,
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.100]   "Oh, that's Paul. That's that guy."
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.100]   They were probably celebrities because they were attached to Christ.
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:48.100]   And so they were at the peak of their success.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.100]   Like, we're famous.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.100]   We're famous.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:57.100]   We have 20,000 people and more who recognize who we are.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.100]   And that's exactly what they were thinking.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.100]   If we follow Jesus, this is going to happen.
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:06.100]   And then all of a sudden, Jesus has a conversation with these people saying,
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.100]   "You're following me because you want bread."
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.100]   He said, "Yes, we want bread."
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.100]   He said, "I am the bread."
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.100]   "Okay, then give me some bread."
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.100]   He said, "No, I am the bread."
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.100]   "Okay, okay, then prove it.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.100]   What do you want?"
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.100]   "I want some bread."
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.100]   That's the conversation that takes place in John chapter 6.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.100]   And then at the end of that conversation,
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.100]   Jesus, recognizing that their hearts are hardened,
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.100]   they don't really believe him, and then he says,
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.100]   "If you want to follow me, you have to do what?"
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:36.100]   "You have to eat my flesh and drink my blood."
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   They're like, "What?"
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:42.100]   I mean, that's the most sacrilegious thing that anybody can say.
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:46.100]   They were told all their lives that if they drank the blood of animals,
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.100]   they can be killed for that.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:52.100]   But he's saying, "You've got to drink my blood and eat my flesh."
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.100]   So we know how the multitudes heard that.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.100]   Because in John 6, 66, they said they turned away.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.100]   "This is too hard.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:06.100]   He just told us to eat him."
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.100]   What is that?
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.100]   So they left him.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.100]   So can you imagine?
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.100]   The disciples are on the side.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:19.100]   They're like, "Yes, we're the apostles of Jesus Christ."
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:23.100]   They probably still have the baskets of bread and fish left over
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:28.100]   that they're carrying around to identify who they were.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:32.100]   All of a sudden, they all disappear.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.100]   What?
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.100]   We thought we were going to be glorified.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.100]   That's like having 10 million followers and waking up the next day
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.100]   and having zero.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.100]   This is for the young crowd.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:48.100]   The old people, I'll explain later.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.100]   It happened overnight.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.100]   And it's not like the disciples understood.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.100]   They were confused too.
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.100]   This is hard.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:02.100]   So after they left, Jesus turns to his disciples and he asks them,
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.100]   "Are you going to leave too?"
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.100]   Because he knew that they were confused.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.100]   But this is their answer, John 6, 68.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.100]   "Simon Peter answered him, 'Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.100]   You have words of eternal life.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:25.100]   We have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.'"
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.100]   In other words, "I don't understand it either.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.100]   Why did you do that?
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.100]   Why did you do that?
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.100]   I don't get it. What do you mean by that?"
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.100]   "Okay, are you going to leave too?"
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.100]   "Where are we going to go?"
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:45.100]   "I don't understand you, but I believe you.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.100]   I don't know what you're doing.
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.100]   I don't know why you're causing all these problems
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:56.100]   and why my life is so hard and why it's so difficult just to make it to the next day.
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.100]   I don't know. I don't know what you're doing.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:02.100]   But I believe you."
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:06.100]   So their faith, that tiny little mustard seed,
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:09.100]   kept them connected to Christ.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.100]   "We believe you."
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:17.100]   There are times in our lives that our only confession is,
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:21.100]   "What else? Where else am I going to go?
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:25.100]   I don't know what's going on. I don't know why he's allowing this to happen.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.100]   I can't explain. I'm so tired.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.100]   Where else am I going to go?"
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.100]   That tiny little seed, mustard seed,
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.100]   connects us to the Almighty God.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.100]   That's what he means.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.100]   And that's what enduring faith is.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.100]   Sometimes it's strong. Sometimes it's weak.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.100]   Sometimes it's so tiny.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.100]   But if you have it,
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.100]   that powerful God will move mountains. Amen?
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:59.100]   So all that is a setup for now,
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.100]   if we believe,
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:06.100]   this is what is capable of happening.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   So my encouragement to us,
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.100]   if there's any time in our lives,
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:16.100]   and I've said this repeatedly,
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.100]   where you need to be anchored in Christ,
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.100]   it's now.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.100]   Because persecution is here, and it is coming.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:29.100]   Difficult times are here, and it is coming.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.100]   Turmoil is already here,
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.100]   but greater one is coming.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.100]   I'm not talking about the political arena.
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.100]   I'm talking about in the church.
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.100]   Spirit of delusion
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:47.100]   has already entered into the churches.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:50.100]   And there is so much confusion,
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.100]   even among Christians,
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:56.100]   and even among pastors.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.100]   So if we're not grounded and connected to the Almighty God
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:02.100]   through our faith in his word,
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:05.100]   if there's any time, confusion is going to come into the church,
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.100]   it is now.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.100]   So I encourage you, and I implore you,
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.100]   to be connected to this Christ. Be in the word.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.100]   In season and out of season. Let's pray.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.100]   [clapping]
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:23.100]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your goodness.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:27.100]   We thank you for your patience with us.
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:30.100]   Lord, we thank you
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.100]   that there are some in our midst
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.100]   who are thriving in their faith, that
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:39.100]   even during the pandemic, it would only cause them to
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.100]   long for you and love you more.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.100]   But then there are also some of us who are just
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.100]   holding on by a tiny thread.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.100]   But even in that,
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.100]   we thank you for the promise
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.100]   that though we are weak, you are strong.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.100]   Help us, Lord God, to persevere, to endure,
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.100]   as we will be implored over and over again
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   through this text.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.100]   May Christ and his sacrifice be honored,
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:12.100]   declared, and worshipped.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.100]   Thank you, Lord. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
