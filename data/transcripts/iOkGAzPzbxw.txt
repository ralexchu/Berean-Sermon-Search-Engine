[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.980]   - All right, good morning.
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.700]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.940]   Let me get started with a few announcements.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:19.220]   First of all, you got this invitation card
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.560]   when you were coming in.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.460]   This is the invitation for our Christmas service
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.700]   that's happening on the 22nd.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.540]   And again, we wanna take every opportunity that we have
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.580]   when you know that your family and friends are coming,
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.340]   that we, as we share about the meaning of Christmas
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.500]   and obviously there's going to be
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.340]   a clear gospel presentation on that day.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.100]   And so for you to prepare for that as well,
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.260]   but also you can take it and then you can just,
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.100]   even if you just hand it out to one person
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.300]   or your neighbors or coworkers or whatever it is,
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.340]   to take that opportunity.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.820]   So we have some today, and then the rest of it,
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.660]   we have the bulk of it coming next week.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.620]   So if you didn't get one, grab one.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.940]   If you need more, you can grab some as you're going out.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.660]   But please use this as an opportunity to,
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.700]   even if they don't come, to be able to break the ice
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.740]   and share the gospel with them
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.940]   about the meaning of Christmas
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.480]   and be able to share with them the gospel, okay?
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.240]   Along with that, every Christmas,
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.460]   we have a Lottie Moon Christmas mission offering
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.060]   that we take, and this is to support the mission work
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.900]   that's taking place.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.420]   Again, as you guys know, we have Pastor Alex
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.660]   who is out in Taiwan that we are supporting,
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.160]   but we are supporting through the Lottie Moon offering,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.620]   our annual offering.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.380]   And so if you go online when you give,
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.580]   there's going to be an area through the subsplash
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.740]   where you designate it
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.900]   toward the Christmas mission offering.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.340]   So if you give it to them,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.300]   our finance department is gonna be able to separate that
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.780]   from the regular offering.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.300]   And then, so typically in the past,
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.740]   we just did it on that day,
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.700]   but we're gonna start even today.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.820]   It's gonna be open up until the 22nd.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.180]   So whatever offering that comes in is designated
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.260]   for the Lottie Moon offering, for the mission offering,
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.300]   please designate it for that,
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.540]   and then we'll be able to send that over
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.780]   as soon as we get it.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.940]   And then, again, up to the 22nd, okay?
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.180]   So if you have a physical offering,
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.340]   we have a physical offering box.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.500]   If you have a check, make sure you designate it
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.340]   that this is for Lottie Moon offering,
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.000]   and it's for the next three weeks.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.900]   Again, that offering will specifically go for that.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.180]   College Study Hall, the end of the quarter,
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.380]   College Study Hall is happening,
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.460]   starting next Sunday to Tuesday.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.360]   So they're asking that if you are willing
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.060]   and you're able to get signups for snacks
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.620]   and various things to just kind of encourage them,
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.640]   you can sign up for that,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.380]   and then you can drop it off in the cafe area,
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.900]   starting next Sunday to Tuesday.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.740]   Annual ping pong tournament is happening
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.540]   on December 31st, 5 p.m. here in the sanctuary.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.780]   So if you're interested in signing up for that,
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.860]   again, the ping pong tournament happens
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.380]   from 5 p.m. to about 9 p.m.,
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.380]   and then we have our annual end of the year service,
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.460]   and you can just stick around
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.460]   or go grab dinner and come back.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.780]   But if you're planning to sign up,
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.780]   there will be a signup table as you're going outside.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.020]   There'll be a table outside so you can sign up there.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.820]   Also for the BBA and WBBA.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.860]   This is for the members or people
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.200]   who are becoming members in the church
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.780]   for the purpose of fellowship within the church.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.060]   If you are planning to sign up,
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.460]   please sign up, go outside,
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.660]   and then sign up at the table
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.700]   as you're going out for all three services.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.220]   And then finally, our BAM retreat.
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.740]   The theme is Run to Win,
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.740]   and it's gonna be in January 31st to February 2nd
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.300]   at Pali Retreat, assuming that there's no natural disasters
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.240]   or the roads are still working,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.040]   that retreat is gonna be happening.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.060]   And the space is limited, okay?
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.540]   Last time, I think they had over,
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.300]   more than 200 people sign up for this,
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.260]   so there's a cap in the space.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.420]   So if you're planning to go, please sign up early.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.460]   Our pastor that's gonna come and speak for us
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.460]   is Pastor Ian Kwon on the theme of Run to Win, okay?
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.660]   So please sign up for that.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.940]   That is also happening outside as you are exiting.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.120]   You'll see it run into a table,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.740]   and please sign up for that as well.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.500]   I think that's all for the announcements.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.460]   Let me pray for us,
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.180]   and then I'll give you a minute to give your offering.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.780]   Again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.980]   please drop it off on the box on the way out, all right?
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.820]   Let's pray.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:12.420]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.660]   We thank you, Father, for sustaining us
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.580]   and giving us a pause, Lord, in our schedule
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.740]   to give thanks to all the things
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.060]   that you've been doing in our lives
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.340]   and things that we are thankful for,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.660]   things that we ought to be thankful for,
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.460]   and we ask, Lord God, that as we have come to worship you,
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.760]   that it may be an overflow of the gratitude in our hearts,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.740]   Lord God, that we give to you.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.220]   May this time be a pleasing aroma to you.
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.340]   May the giving be given as an act of obedience,
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.360]   an act of worship, and may it be multiplied
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.820]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.800]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:15.040]   If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter nine,
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.400]   be reading from verse 57 to 62.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.160]   Luke chapter nine, verse 57 to 62.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.040]   Okay, reading out of the NASB.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.840]   As they were going along the road,
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.320]   someone said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.400]   And Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.460]   "and the birds of the air have nests,
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.320]   "but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head."
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.260]   And he said to another, "Follow me."
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.120]   But he said, "Lord, permit me first to go
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.780]   "and bury my father."
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.160]   But he said to him, "Allow the dead to bury their own dead,
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.280]   "but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.000]   "the kingdom of God."
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.700]   Another also said, "I will follow you, Lord,
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.420]   "but first permit me to say goodbye to those at home."
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.600]   But Jesus said to him, "No one, after putting his hand
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.040]   "to the plow and looking back,
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.960]   "is fit for the kingdom of God."
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.800]   Let's pray.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   Father, we pray for deeper understanding.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.160]   We pray for conviction from your word
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.020]   that we'd be obedient to you,
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.280]   that we would not simply be hearers but to be doers.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.320]   May the power of your word affect us,
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.520]   mold us, and challenge us,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.240]   that we may conform to the image of Christ in every way.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.080]   Just as a quick review to understand
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   where this very difficult teaching is coming from.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.460]   Up to this point, Jesus has been doing public ministry,
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.600]   and so he's been somewhat rejected.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.940]   After he feeds the 5,000, he turns his attention
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.260]   to the 12 disciples, preparing them to go to the cross.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.840]   So he's been revealing himself.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.260]   He asked them, "Who do men say that I am,
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.000]   "but who do you say that I am?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.360]   "And upon this confession, I will build my church,
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.760]   "and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.080]   And then he's been instructing them,
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.440]   preparing them for the cross.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.560]   He's about six months away before he goes,
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.760]   and he's already warned his disciples where he's going,
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.220]   but they don't fully understand
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.680]   because they think that at the end of this journey,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.540]   he's gonna be sitting on his throne,
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.160]   and so they're thinking who's gonna benefit the most,
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   who's gonna sit on the left
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.120]   and who's gonna sit on the right.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   That's the mindset of where they are at,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.240]   and that's not just unique to the disciples.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.840]   Other people are clamoring and fighting
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.640]   to get to Jesus, not only to get to Jesus,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.920]   but can they possibly be part of his disciples
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.200]   who are walking with him?
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.320]   Jesus says three very difficult things here.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.120]   Now, you might just hear it and say,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.700]   well, maybe this is just for the disciples.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.620]   This is not for everybody.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.740]   This is not a calling for every person
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.260]   who wants to follow Christ.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.940]   Could it possibly be?
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.980]   If you've already read the text,
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.180]   you may have just kind of skimmed over it and say,
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.460]   wow, Jesus was very harsh,
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.700]   and who would follow Christ
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.760]   if this was the criteria for following Jesus?
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.780]   And so we may just dismiss it and say,
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.660]   this doesn't apply to him,
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.140]   or maybe the time is different.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.480]   Jesus already went to the cross,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.200]   and that's not what he expects from us today.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.340]   We're gonna look carefully,
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.700]   and we're gonna see that this is exactly the calling
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.100]   of every disciple,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.760]   and the question that we need to ask ourselves is,
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.220]   have you made this commitment?
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.260]   Would you follow this Christ?
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.660]   Not a Christ that's been watered down,
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.340]   not a Christ that's been made to fit our culture
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.380]   and our generation,
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:41.020]   not a Christ that's going to challenge our way of life,
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.400]   but if this is what Jesus said to follow me,
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.360]   would you come?
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.960]   Can you imagine if we had a evangelical crusade,
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.280]   and we had all the best speakers of our generation
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.680]   come and give a presentation,
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.600]   and then said, if anybody wishes to come after me,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.560]   come down to this aisle, raise your hand,
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.800]   and say the sinner's prayer,
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.760]   but then before you say this sinner's prayer,
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.440]   I want you to know exactly what is required of you.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.840]   I need you to come down with your bags packed.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.500]   'Cause we're gonna get on a plane,
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.180]   we're gonna go to the remotest part of the world,
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.940]   and I'm not, I can't guarantee
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.800]   that we're gonna have a house to stay in,
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.520]   I can't guarantee that we're gonna be able to eat well,
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.940]   I can't guarantee if we're gonna be even comfortable,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.980]   we may even die early,
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.900]   but pack your bags and come after me,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.780]   and they said, well, what about my parents?
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.340]   He said, no, let the dead bury the dead,
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.060]   you come with me.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.140]   And he said, well, let me go back
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.020]   and at least say goodbye to my family.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.240]   He said, he who puts his hands to the plow
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.080]   and turns back is not worthy of the kingdom of God.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.360]   Now, you need to come now.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.160]   If you want to receive Christ and follow me,
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.760]   get your bags, come down, and we're gonna leave.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.080]   How many people would come?
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.280]   How many people would come?
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.040]   Even the ones who say, I do wanna come, would hesitate.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.240]   Yet that's exactly what Jesus says here.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.160]   That's exactly what Jesus says here.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.000]   So, is this actually to be applied?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.940]   Or is this just for the 12 disciples?
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.980]   Or the man who was asking?
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.180]   Is this only relevant to the first century?
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.180]   Or is this actually something that we are to apply?
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.180]   When Jesus says, to deny yourself,
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.580]   pick up your cross daily and follow me,
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.040]   was that just to the disciples, or is that relevant today?
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.900]   Isn't that a question that really is important to all of us?
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.900]   If he is requiring this as discipleship
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.460]   for every single person, who have made this decision?
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.900]   Who had committed their life to Christ,
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.160]   if this is the criteria to follow Jesus?
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.560]   Let me look at three things that he says here,
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.400]   and every single one of them is difficult,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.560]   but it's gonna get exponentially difficult as he goes down.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.720]   First, he says to count the cost.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.520]   Luke chapter 9, 57 to 58, it says,
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.840]   as they were going along the road,
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.840]   someone said to him, I will follow you wherever you go.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.420]   You notice here, he doesn't say, can I follow you?
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.860]   He says, I will follow you.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.160]   And it's almost kind of like he's doing him a favor.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.380]   I'll follow you.
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.600]   Part of the reason why he says this so boldly
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.680]   is because the parallel passage in Matthew 8 says,
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.520]   it was a scribe who was coming to him and asking him,
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.560]   I'll follow you.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.920]   A scribe at that time was kind of a celebrity figure.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.160]   He was already what's considered a religious giant.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.080]   He was the expert of the law.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.160]   He was a lawyer of the town.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.100]   So if you had any questions about your faith,
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.600]   about the Sabbath law and any tradition,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.960]   this is the guy you would go to.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.000]   So if you ask, who would be one of Jesus' followers,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.400]   if the Messiah comes, he's gonna pick only 12 people,
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.640]   the scribe would definitely be part of that group,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.680]   at least most people would have thought.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.500]   So the scribe comes to him and says, I'll follow you.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.700]   Maybe these other people, they don't know who you are,
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.960]   but let me follow you.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.200]   Jesus, instead of saying, welcome,
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.820]   he says, foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.640]   but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.080]   Now, reason why he calls himself the Son of Man,
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.580]   he used that title of himself more than any other title.
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.800]   And there's a reason behind that,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.600]   because there was a specific prophecy
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.400]   about the Messiah that was gonna come in Daniel chapter seven
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.880]   and he said, that king, that anointed one,
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.320]   when he comes, the Son of Man, when he comes,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.480]   he's going to have an everlasting kingdom.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.840]   He's gonna be an everlasting king.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.400]   They're gonna call him the Ancient of Days.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.840]   So this was not an ordinary man.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.440]   This was a very specific prophecy,
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.440]   even though the term Son of Man is used for other people,
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.320]   Jesus was using this as a title
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.960]   of a fulfillment of the Messiah.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.200]   And the reason why he's using this term
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.240]   is because they thought that if they followed
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.680]   the Son of Man, the Messiah, the anointed king,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.360]   he's gonna obviously gonna go sit on his throne.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.720]   If a king comes, obviously he's gonna sit on his throne.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.160]   And so the disciples were thinking, if we follow this king,
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.800]   we're gonna be part of his cabinet members
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.600]   to sit on his left and sit on his right.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.280]   And so probably the scribe was thinking the same thing,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.560]   that if I follow the Son of Man, this king,
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.960]   that I'm gonna be elevated,
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.000]   even though he's already in an elevated position
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.440]   religiously, but then clearly following the Messiah
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.400]   is going to, there's gonna be some side benefits to this.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.280]   And that's why he says, I will follow you.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   But Jesus' answer to him is,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.640]   even the animals have a place to raise their head.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.200]   Even the birds, insignificant animals,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.640]   but the king of Israel has nowhere to rest his head.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.740]   In other words, he's saying he's homeless.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.960]   In other words, what he's saying is two things here.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.600]   One, he doesn't have a home yet.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.560]   In fact, he left his home in order to come.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.120]   He did not come to be served, but to serve
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.480]   and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   So one, he's left his home for the purpose of this mission.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.440]   And two, that he is engaged in this work tirelessly.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.440]   You know, we live different when we're not home, right?
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   We don't buy things.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.280]   We don't seek for the most comfortable place,
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.840]   even though we may be on vacation,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.720]   'cause it's not our home.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.680]   Even if it's not the most uncomfortable,
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.240]   I mean, not the most comfortable
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.520]   and it's not the best food, we know we're not home.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.900]   And so he is reminding the scribe and his disciples
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.000]   that the Son of Man, the king of Israel,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.880]   did not come to be served.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.240]   The foxes have holes, but the words of the heirs
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.800]   have nests, but the king of Israel has nowhere to rest.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.920]   In other words, we're not gonna end up
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.520]   what you think is gonna happen.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.840]   You think that I'm gonna go to Jerusalem
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.160]   and I'm gonna conquer Rome and I'm gonna sit on my throne.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.900]   That's not what he came to do.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.720]   He came to seek and save the lost.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.260]   In John 10, 16, Jesus says, "I have other sheep
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.340]   "which are not of this fold.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.620]   "I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.960]   "and they will become one flock with one shepherd."
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.140]   Not only did I come to seek and save the lost in Israel,
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.380]   but this work is gonna continue
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.080]   to the remotest part of the world.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.560]   And so every one of his disciples
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.400]   are gonna continue the work that the Son of Man came to do,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.020]   that it's not gonna stop at the cross, it's gonna continue.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.700]   Second Thessalonians 3, 3-1,
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.200]   Apostle Paul says, "Finally, brethren,
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.640]   "pray for us that the word of the Lord
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.380]   "will spread rapidly and be glorified
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.440]   "just as it did also with you."
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.840]   And Apostle Paul lived like he was gonna die tomorrow.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.640]   And every one of those disciples,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.040]   every one of those disciples
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.040]   did exactly what Jesus told them to do.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.480]   They didn't understand.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.900]   They thought he was going to the cross.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.540]   When Jesus started going to the cross,
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.480]   they were confused and they abandoned him,
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.760]   but after the resurrection,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.440]   they realized what Jesus was saying
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   is exactly what Jesus was requiring,
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.720]   and that's exactly what they did.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.280]   Every single one of them left everything behind
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.360]   and gave their life to continue the work
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.160]   of what Christ did on the cross.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:21.960]   Jesus says from the beginning to count the cost,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.080]   to count the cost.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.200]   In our generation, in our culture,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   because we're trying to attract as many people as possible,
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.600]   and with that paradigm,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.640]   we try to make it as easy as possible
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.000]   for sinners to feel comfortable at church.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.660]   Unrepentant sinners who have not fully
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.560]   devoted themselves to Christ yet
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   have not committed themselves to Christ yet,
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.720]   but we want to make it comfortable.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.240]   So we want to have programs for children.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.360]   We want to have certain organizations.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.440]   We want to have a building.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.680]   We want to have our service time
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.400]   that's going to be convenient for the most people.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.220]   We don't want people to drive more than 30, 40, 50 minutes,
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.760]   or else people aren't going to come.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.860]   So we are trying our best to attract uncommitted people
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.560]   to be comfortable at church.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.680]   And as a result of that,
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.880]   we have a church generation filled with people
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.720]   who have not decided to follow Christ,
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.300]   but who are active members in the church.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.380]   And Jesus was telling them right off the bat,
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.680]   from the very get-go, to count the cost.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.800]   Jesus says in Luke chapter 14, 28,
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.280]   "You don't start building a tower
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.220]   "until you have calculated that you have enough to finish."
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.440]   You would be a fool if you started to build a home,
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.520]   and you only have enough to build a foundation,
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.960]   and you don't have the rest.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.860]   You would not even begin.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.060]   And then he says in verse 31,
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.280]   "A king is not going to go into battle
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.860]   "if he sees an army coming with 20,000 soldiers,
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.280]   "and you only have 10.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.820]   "And in your calculation,
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.300]   "you're not going to be able to conquer this king,
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.500]   "so you're not going to engage this battle."
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.380]   Jesus uses that as an illustration about following Christ.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.260]   Have you count the cost?
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.660]   What is required of you?
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.400]   What does it mean to be a follower of Jesus Christ?
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.280]   Or, have you just thought,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.320]   you know, if I just go to church,
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.840]   I'm not going to church if I go to church.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.240]   I'm not serving if I serve the church.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.800]   And you have retained everything of your old life.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.540]   Nothing has been abandoned,
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.540]   but you've retained everything of your old life.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.800]   So every once in a while,
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.680]   when you get poked in the area where you're uncomfortable,
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.080]   there's a little bit of discomfort,
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.040]   or maybe even a little bit of pushback.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.200]   A few weeks ago.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   You know, this is a commonly known thing
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.120]   among all the pastors in my generation.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.960]   Don't talk about money in the church.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.560]   'Cause you're going to get a pushback.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.600]   I can talk about sexual immorality,
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.440]   we can talk about faithfulness to the church,
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.600]   to your wife, to your children,
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.000]   we can talk about all of these things,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.360]   and people will maybe even thank you for it.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.560]   But if you talk about money,
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.440]   there's going to be pushback.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.960]   Has God really said that?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.760]   Is the church just doing this and that?
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.000]   Because he says where your treasure is,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.300]   there your heart is.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.880]   And so a few weeks ago,
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.620]   I gave one of our covenants is to tithe and to give,
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.160]   and to establish Christ as Lord over your life.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.600]   And I already know.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.800]   It's going to make a lot of people feel uncomfortable.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.220]   Even the people who've been walking with the Lord
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.520]   for many years are going to feel uncomfortable.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.760]   Because at the core of what we value
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.760]   is represented in money.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.460]   So when Christ is not Lord over money,
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.640]   we can give everything else,
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.200]   as long as I retain my security,
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.480]   because money represents my time, my life,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.220]   my security, my peace.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.560]   And so when we are challenged in that area,
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.860]   which Jesus talks about very often,
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.340]   said, well, I gave all this other stuff,
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.560]   but this stuff I need.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.960]   Jesus said, if you follow me,
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.120]   I don't even have a place to rest my head.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:04.560]   I didn't even prioritize where I'm going to sleep
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.960]   if you follow me.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.520]   You sure you want to follow me?
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.720]   In Luke 14, 33, so then none of you can be my disciple
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.480]   who does not give up all his own possessions.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.260]   Not just your time, not just your intellect,
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.980]   not just your Saturdays or extra time.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.800]   He says, all your possessions.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.240]   That's not Berean community church.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.720]   In fact, Jesus says this over and over and over again,
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.320]   because he knows exactly,
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:37.520]   he knows exactly where our treasure in our life is.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.980]   It's in our bank accounts.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.680]   As long as my bank account is secure,
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.420]   as long as my house and my investments are doing well,
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.400]   as long as you don't challenge me in this area,
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.840]   then everything else I can offer up to God.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.240]   And Jesus says, if you follow me,
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.080]   foxes have holes, birds of the air has nests,
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.680]   but the Son of Man, you sure you want to follow me?
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.880]   I don't even have a home to rest my head.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.200]   Who would want to follow this Jesus?
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.400]   Now, the Jesus of our culture, follow Jesus,
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.080]   and if you pray enough, and if you maybe even
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.920]   give a little bit, God's going to bless you,
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.200]   and your family's going to be taken care of,
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.680]   you're going to have plenty to retire on,
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.900]   and everything that, well, you're going to maintain,
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.840]   but Jesus is a way to have what you desire,
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.120]   but he's going to make it even better.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.060]   Just trust him.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.680]   Now, that Jesus, many will follow,
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.680]   but this Jesus, it gets worse, right?
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.300]   So if that shook you up, this is going to get even worse.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.760]   He says in Luke 9, 59 to 60, and he said to the brother,
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.960]   another, follow me, but he said, Lord, permit me first
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.080]   to go and bury my father, but he said to him,
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.400]   allow the dead to bury their own dead,
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.600]   but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.260]   the kingdom of God.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.100]   Wait a second, I can't even go back home
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.560]   to bury my father?
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.760]   If I want to be a disciple of Jesus Christ,
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.920]   I can't even bury my father, what's going on here?
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.000]   I mean, the Bible, in the 10 Commandments,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.120]   it says if you want to live long and prosper,
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.480]   honor your father and mother.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.060]   In fact, he rebukes the scribes and the Pharisees
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.600]   for dedicating a certain amount of money
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.780]   to the temple called the Korban,
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.080]   and then using that as an excuse,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.240]   I don't have enough to support my parents,
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.940]   and he rebukes them for that.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.520]   He rebukes them for not honoring their father and mother,
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.080]   and you have to remember, this is an Asian culture.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.860]   This is a very Asian culture,
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.960]   and I'm not saying the Western culture
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.760]   don't care about parents, but this is highlighted
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.800]   in particular in an Asian culture.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.920]   This is something that I learned
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.520]   growing up as a Korean American.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.200]   I realized growing up that in the Korean context
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.880]   and many other Asian contexts,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.640]   you don't say somebody is mature
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.120]   until they learn to honor your father and mother.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.840]   You can be independent, make a lot of money,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.560]   and become a big name in society,
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.040]   but until you recognize the people who sacrificed for you,
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.920]   you're not really mature.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.060]   That's not unique to Korea, that's an Asian culture.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.700]   And so this guy was basically saying,
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.560]   "Let me go back and take care of my dad,"
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.320]   and Jesus says, "Leave him.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.840]   "Let the dead bury the dead."
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.720]   If you look at the context,
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.920]   he's not referring to a father who's died,
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.640]   because by Jewish law, he had to go back and bury him.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.280]   If his father was dead, he wouldn't be able
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.040]   to be walking around, even talking to Jesus,
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.000]   'cause he had to be isolated for seven days,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.640]   up to even 30 days,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.000]   'cause he would've been considered unclean,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.320]   handling his dead father's body,
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.440]   and he would've made other people
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.760]   who came into contact with him unclean.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.760]   So the fact that he's even having a conversation with Jesus
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.440]   is probably his father is not dead.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   In fact, that term, bury my father,
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.000]   is a Middle Eastern term that is still even used
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.460]   up to this day, and that term, bury my father,
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.080]   basically means let me go home
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.080]   and take care of my family first.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.040]   So after my father is old and he dies,
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.560]   and then I get his inheritance,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.440]   and I don't have to worry about my family anymore,
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.080]   then let me follow you.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:13.240]   He's addressing the condition of that person's heart,
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.520]   where he says, "I will follow you
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.880]   "once I've taken care of everything I need to take care of."
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.720]   The struggle with many believers
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.920]   is not a struggle between good and evil.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.760]   That's easy.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.220]   Good and evil, that's easy.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.700]   Normally the struggle is between good and what's best.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.600]   What's best.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.520]   Usually when we say to God, not yet,
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.200]   it's not because, oh, I wanna experience the world,
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.720]   and I wanna sow my roots and do whatever I want,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.480]   and then I'll follow Jesus.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.680]   That person probably isn't even a Christian.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.440]   Most people's struggle is not that.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.600]   And we never say no, we say not yet.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.580]   Maybe once my children are a little bit older,
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.240]   maybe once I have the bank account,
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.160]   and maybe once the retirement is taken care of,
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.440]   once the mortgage is, once my kid's a certain way,
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.000]   and once I get married, and so if you're 20,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.960]   you say, well, right now I need to fixate on my career,
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.080]   and then once you get married,
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.880]   then I gotta take care of my wife and my children,
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.920]   then you get a little bit older,
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.960]   once my parents are taken care of,
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.200]   and for the rest of your life,
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.360]   there's always something that you need to be responsible for
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.200]   and you make taking care of your family
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.540]   equal to following Jesus Christ.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.940]   Jesus says,
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:34.880]   let the dead bury the dead.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.320]   What he's saying is very difficult to swallow.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.960]   Who would follow this Jesus?
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.220]   Luke 14, 26 is if anyone comes to me
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.400]   and does not hate his own father and mother
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.580]   and wife and children and brothers and sisters,
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.860]   yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.980]   If you're joining us for the first time,
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.480]   what kind of a church is this?
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:06.080]   Like, I don't want my kids coming to this church.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.500]   What I read to you is not a doctrine
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.680]   of Berean community church,
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.080]   I just read to you from scripture.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.660]   In fact, Jesus repeats this over and over again
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.500]   in his teaching.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.760]   The priority of Christ above all things.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.980]   But again, the question is,
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.840]   who would follow this Jesus?
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.660]   The Jesus of our culture,
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.540]   the Jesus kind of like take all the sharp edges off,
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.900]   Jesus who doesn't judge and love you unconditionally
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.580]   no matter what you do,
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.900]   Jesus who supports you,
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:40.400]   Jesus who is gonna give you glory one day,
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.560]   but he says, follow me, I'm homeless.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.620]   Leave your family now and come after me.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.980]   Well, it gets even worse than that.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.180]   In verse 61 and 62,
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:03.180]   he says, complete undivided attention and loyalty to him.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.600]   Another also said, I will follow you, Lord,
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.740]   but first permit me to say goodbye to those at home.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:13.420]   Jesus said, no one after putting his hand to the plow
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.820]   and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.820]   All he's asking is to go home and say goodbye,
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.460]   and Jesus says, no.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.260]   How do you understand this?
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.460]   What is he saying?
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.860]   Well, he explains when he says,
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.100]   no one after putting his hand to the plow
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.980]   and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.060]   He's addressing somebody who is committed,
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.620]   but he's constantly looking back at what he left behind.
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:47.220]   You need to be completely, completely committed to me.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.940]   You notice here of the three things that he says
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.280]   and the two harder things that he says,
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.340]   well, let the dead bury the dead
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.720]   and don't even say goodbye, come now.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.240]   They both pertain to family.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.700]   They both pertain to family,
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.980]   especially in an Asian culture.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.300]   Those of you who've traveled and did missions,
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.380]   when we just came back from Taiwan,
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:16.620]   and one of the biggest obstacles
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.260]   of bringing somebody to Christ is their family.
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.940]   They will come and say, you know, it makes sense to me
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.100]   and I want to follow Jesus, but if I follow Jesus,
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.640]   it would mean that my parents are gonna disown me,
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.720]   that all the things that we've learned,
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.020]   ancestral worship and all this stuff,
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.720]   my parents are gonna think, but we're abandoning them.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.180]   We saw the same thing in Japan.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.660]   Where people were interested and they're taught,
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:42.660]   you know what they're saying,
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.620]   like a nail that sticks out gets hammered first
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.940]   and you see that everywhere in the culture.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.780]   Everybody just is forced to conform
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.460]   and so everything is done excellently
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.780]   because nobody rebels, not publicly.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.820]   And that's part of the main reason
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.500]   why people are unwilling to make that decision.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.820]   They'll say, I'm interested, it makes sense,
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:02.980]   I want to be your friend,
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.140]   but to make that final decision to follow Christ,
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.700]   they say, my parents are gonna disown me.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.260]   In fact, not only are they gonna disown me,
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.340]   this is a betrayal to our country
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.700]   to accept this foreign God into our home.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.140]   So they'll come right to the gate
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.420]   and never make that decision.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.980]   We see the same thing in India.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:26.560]   They'll hear the gospel and from the pressure from family,
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.100]   'cause they know they're gonna be disowned,
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.180]   and the group of pastors that we work with,
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.580]   that's exactly what happened to them.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.300]   A former Hindu priest who became a Christian
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.660]   was kicked out of his home.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.580]   His father kicked him out with three small children.
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.100]   He was left wandering in the streets,
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.700]   sharing the gospel from village to village.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.460]   And in fear, in fear of that,
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.700]   people will not make that decision
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.940]   and people will say, you're betraying not only your family,
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.040]   but your country.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.420]   And so even the people who are interested
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.460]   will come right to the door and never fully commit.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.060]   But you know what's interesting here
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.820]   is that would never happen here.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.380]   Not because there's no pressure,
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:13.900]   not because the call is any different for us,
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.100]   it's because the church is more than willing
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.840]   to accommodate the uncommitted.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:27.220]   I've given portions, bits and pieces, but not all.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:33.060]   I know you guys are probably already uncomfortable, right?
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.120]   Is he gonna end the sermon this way, right?
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.480]   Well, I mean, you read what I read.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.720]   You're seeing what I'm seeing.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.880]   But the question is, who would follow this Jesus?
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.760]   If this Jesus was preached,
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.900]   if this is what they understood
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.360]   in the masses that are coming,
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.240]   when they say 100,000, 200,000,
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.840]   two million people came to Christ,
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.880]   how many people heard this before they came to Christ?
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.720]   Let me give you a simple answer to that.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:11.840]   Not only do people make commitments like this,
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.280]   they get anxious when they don't.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.240]   And let me tell you what I mean by that.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.280]   Some of you in this, even here in the congregation,
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.960]   like I've officiated your wedding.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.820]   If I officiated your wedding, your vows,
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.160]   'cause I've never changed the vows
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.920]   since the first time I started it, right?
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.480]   And so even if I didn't officiate your wedding,
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.760]   maybe one of the other pastors officiated the wedding,
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.200]   their wedding vows were similar.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.000]   And it contained something like this, okay?
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.380]   So if I officiated, you said this.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.760]   I'm gonna remind you in case you forgot.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:53.280]   I so and so, right, this is the guys portion,
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.880]   take so and so as my lawfully wedded wife.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.980]   Easy, that part.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.960]   I promise to love her sacrificially
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.560]   as Christ loved the church.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.280]   How did Christ love the church?
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.440]   He died.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.800]   He gave his life.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:16.840]   Maybe you didn't understand what you were saying, right?
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.100]   Not only did you make this vow,
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.840]   you invited all your family and friends.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:27.160]   Some 30, some five, six, 700 people in front of them,
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.840]   you said, I'm today going to die for my wife.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.200]   From this day forward, as Jesus died for me,
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.300]   I'm gonna die for my wife.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.040]   I will protect and provide for her
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.080]   to the best of my ability from this day forward
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.440]   for better or for worse, whether she deserves it or not,
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.160]   for richer or for poorer, whether I have money or not,
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.640]   in sickness and in health till death do us part,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   until I can't anymore because I'm no longer living.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.880]   Not only did you make this vow,
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.380]   you had a celebration afterwards.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.980]   You didn't make this vow and then go home and mourn.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.880]   I died today.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.240]   She made me do it.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.120]   And I did it in front of everybody,
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.440]   so now I can't turn back.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.280]   No.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.740]   Here's the women's portion.
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.280]   I so and so take so and so
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.480]   as my lawfully wedded husband, easy.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.900]   I promise to honor and submit to his leadership
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.580]   as the church does to Christ.
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:31.660]   Submit to his leadership?
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.580]   This guy?
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:38.140]   This guy, as church does to Christ?
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.900]   He's our Lord and Savior.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.340]   He's our King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.860]   I'm gonna submit to him as the church submits to him?
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.460]   Are you serious?
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.180]   Not only did you make that vow,
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.260]   you invited hundreds of your family and friends
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.620]   and you also celebrated.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.620]   Many of you are sitting here praying
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:59.260]   that you get an opportunity to do this with somebody.
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:04.700]   There's a portion of that vow making
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.980]   where you say, where the pastor will say,
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.060]   what God has put together, let no man separate
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:10.900]   from this day forward,
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.180]   that man will leave his father and mother
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:18.820]   and he will cling to his new wife and husband.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:23.340]   What God put together, let no man separate.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.140]   And then you get to kiss your bride.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:30.900]   Not once did I have anybody protest,
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.500]   leave my father and mother to sacrifice,
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.940]   to love her more than willing,
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.620]   happy to do it, celebrate it.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.380]   You have anniversary pictures hanging on the wall
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.540]   to remind you of this covenant death that you took.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:50.780]   That you're gonna give your life to submission to this man
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.860]   and you celebrate every year you get together
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.860]   and if somebody forgets, you get hurt
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.540]   because they forgot this anniversary.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:05.260]   Why was it a given that when you entered
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:10.100]   this covenant relationship with another human being,
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.260]   you rejoice?
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.860]   When the creator of our soul demands it,
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.500]   why do we say it's too much?
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:26.580]   Is he worth less than our wife?
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:31.340]   Is he worth less than our husband?
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.820]   In fact, in Ephesians chapter five,
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.340]   it tells us as he lays out the relationship
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.820]   between husband and wife, you know how that ends.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:39.820]   At the end of that, he says,
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.780]   this is really not about husband and wife.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.060]   I'm just giving you illustrations
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:45.820]   so that you can understand the relationship
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.780]   between God and his church.
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:52.300]   Every wedding ceremony is not ultimately about you.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.500]   It's to remind us of him,
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.660]   that the real wedding ceremony is gonna happen,
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.420]   real banquet is gonna happen when Christ comes
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:04.980]   and all he is demanding is the same thing
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.180]   that your wife and your husband would demand
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.700]   because of the preciousness and the value
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.600]   of that covenant that you're entering.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.440]   Can you imagine entering in a covenant
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.480]   and the husband says, I will love you when it is convenient?
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.160]   I'll try not to look at other girls,
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.800]   but you know, I'm a human being.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:27.360]   I'll take care of you when it's convenient.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.640]   And if it doesn't work out, so be it.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:33.200]   Who would enter that covenant?
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.440]   What wife, what father, what mother-in-law
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.280]   would be there to celebrate with you for that covenant?
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:44.120]   What wife should enter into a covenant saying,
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.160]   you know what, I'm just gonna submit
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.280]   to the things that are easy.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.960]   I'm gonna follow you and I'm gonna honor you
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.320]   if you deserve it.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.000]   Hopefully you can earn my respect.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.560]   Even though we may struggle with the covenant,
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:03.400]   every single one of us recognize it's a good covenant.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:08.600]   It's what causes us to persevere through tough times,
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.640]   it's what causes us to prioritize our wife and husband,
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.080]   it's what causes us and reminds us of preciousness
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.640]   of what we have entered.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.760]   It reminds us of preciousness of my wife
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.920]   and the priority of my wife,
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.720]   even though we may struggle with it,
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.040]   nobody says we should change that covenant.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.120]   It's asking too much.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.360]   No, nobody says that.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.840]   In fact, over and over again,
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.760]   I have forgotten, so I need to go back.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.600]   Jesus is calling us to a covenant relationship with him.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.960]   Not just casually to admire him,
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.240]   not just casually say, you know what,
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.600]   I'm gonna follow him when it's convenient.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   Not simply because he loves us this much,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:57.520]   which he does, because of the work that he has committed to.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.320]   Every once in a while, I'll counsel somebody
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.880]   and somebody says, you know, my future husband says
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.720]   he wants to be a missionary,
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.920]   but I'm not sure if that's what I want to do.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.960]   Is he really committed?
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.840]   Yes, he's committed.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.800]   He's been praying about this since he was a child
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.120]   and he's gonna go out to missions.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.120]   I want to marry him,
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.320]   but I'm not sure if that's what I want to be.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:19.120]   What do you think I should tell that person?
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:24.160]   Marry him and see what happens.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.560]   Let's see who wins.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.200]   Do you think that's a good counsel?
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.680]   Let's see who wins.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.440]   Let's see who's more spiritual.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.760]   Let's see who's more spiritual.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.320]   Let's see who wins.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.200]   Let's see who's more stubborn.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.000]   Marry him and fight him, right?
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.040]   Fight him so that he doesn't go.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:48.840]   Do you think that's a good counsel?
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.840]   No, the right counsel would be you can't marry him then.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.760]   You can't marry him.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.280]   He's not saying he's gonna be a drunkard.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.520]   He said he wants to carry the gospel
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.680]   to the remotest part of the world
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.080]   and he's looking for somebody to join him
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.120]   and you say you don't want to go,
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.400]   but you want to marry him.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:11.840]   Not only is Jesus worth our devotion,
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.040]   Jesus said this is what he has come to do.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:19.640]   Hebrews 12, two to three, fix your eyes on Jesus,
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   the author and perfecter of faith,
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.080]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.720]   Why do you enter into this covenant
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.120]   with your husband and wife?
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.960]   Because of the joy set before you,
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.680]   because this covenant is going to make you happy.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:39.200]   Nobody forced you, you volunteered and you rejoiced,
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:42.120]   you celebrate every year.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.720]   Because of the joy set before you,
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.440]   despising the shame and has sat down
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.600]   at the right hand of the throne of God,
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.040]   consider him who has endured such hostility
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.360]   by sinners against himself
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.160]   so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:00.160]   When you see what he says from that perspective,
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.720]   not only does it not sound unreasonable,
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:11.280]   what he demands of his people is beautiful.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:16.120]   It's because he has committed to us.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:20.400]   It's because he has committed to us.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.160]   He is our groom, we are his bride.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:29.360]   And so he's not simply asking to follow him, admire him.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   He's asking us to join him, go where he goes,
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:41.360]   do what he does, sacrifice what he sacrifices.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.640]   That as a son of man did not come to be served
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.240]   but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.800]   and to seek and save the lost,
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.800]   to come into a covenant relationship with Christ
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.760]   and join what he has committed to do.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.160]   Matthew 19, 29, everyone who has left house,
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.800]   brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, children,
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.880]   or farm for my name's sake,
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.000]   will receive many times as much
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.440]   and will inherit eternal life.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:13.760]   Many who are first will be last and the last will be first.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:18.400]   We're gonna open up the communion table.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.800]   And if I can ask the leaders to come,
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   we're gonna open up the communion table.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.600]   And I want to remind you again,
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:30.300]   just like we celebrate our wedding day,
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.000]   communion is an opportunity for us
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.440]   to celebrate our union with Christ.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.840]   So if you have not united with Christ,
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.360]   if you have not repented of your sins,
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.020]   this is not a religious ceremony
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:42.480]   where if you just participate somehow,
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.440]   there's some benefit for you.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.880]   So we ask that you would stay seated
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:49.720]   and just be in quiet and prayer and contemplation before God.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:54.040]   Those of you who are ready to come to celebrate this union,
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.080]   maybe you haven't thought about
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.400]   the covenant relationship with God in a while.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.680]   And it's an opportunity for us before you come,
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.780]   search me and know me.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.900]   And maybe I was halfway in,
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.320]   maybe I was just picking and choosing.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.560]   This I like, this I don't like,
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.600]   but you haven't fully surrendered to God.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.920]   You've supposedly entered into a covenant relationship
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.600]   with one foot in and one foot out.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:23.180]   To use this opportunity to rekindle your love for Christ.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.420]   Is he worth it?
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:29.900]   Do you believe that this covenant
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.560]   will lead to a greater joy in eternity?
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.500]   When you are ready, we ask that you would come one by one
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.540]   and let me ask the praise team to come.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.060]   In 1 Corinthians 11, 23, it says,
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.260]   "For I received from the Lord
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.480]   "that which I also delivered to you,
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.760]   "that the Lord Jesus in the night
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.700]   "in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:51.680]   "And when he had given thanks,
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.220]   "he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.220]   "Do this in remembrance of me."
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.460]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.660]   saying, "This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:05.520]   "Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.700]   "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.980]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.540]   After I pray, we're gonna sing our communion song.
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.460]   We're gonna sing that together.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.660]   And then when you are ready, we ask you would come.
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.620]   Again, if you are looking for gluten-free,
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.260]   you go to that table,
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:25.620]   'cause they have that set up for you on that side.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.100]   Those of you who are coming down the middle,
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.260]   the aisles are pretty tight,
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.940]   so we ask that you would make two lines.
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.180]   If you see it merging as one,
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.740]   make sure that you keep two lines,
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.700]   or else we're gonna create traffic up here.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.260]   So two lines, and make sure you get yours,
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.340]   and then you go out to the side
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.100]   so that we don't create a traffic jam up here.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.140]   So let me pray for us,
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.940]   and then we're gonna take some time to prepare us
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.340]   before the communion table gets open.
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.180]   Let's pray.
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.960]   Father, we thank you for this sacred time.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.060]   As you told your disciples to now do this
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.220]   in remembrance of what you've done for us,
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:01.020]   as you delivered Israel,
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.320]   as you passed over, Lord God,
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.200]   your judgment upon this nation
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.860]   because of the blood of the Lamb.
