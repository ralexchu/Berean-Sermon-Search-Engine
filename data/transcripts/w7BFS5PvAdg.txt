[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.280]   Father, I thank you for that testimony.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   And God, thank you for your word that we're about to open
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   that shows us what our Savior did.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.280]   And Father, that every step that he took was so necessary,
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.280]   and not just necessary, but the only way.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   Father, without him having done what he did,
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.280]   we would have no hope.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.280]   Without Christ, Father, we are nothing.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   And so as we go into your word, I pray that our eyes and ears
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:29.280]   would enlarge and God to be able to hear and be captivated again
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.280]   by what you did.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.780]   Amen.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:39.280]   Well, we're continuing here to observe his walk to the cross.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   And as Pastor Mark left us with last night,
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.280]   Jesus, he overturns the tables at the temple.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   And these religious leaders are scheming.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   They're scheming together.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.280]   And they're trying to ensnare Jesus.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   And this is all heightening as time goes.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.280]   And what's amazing is that it wasn't the Romans who were
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   leading the charge in this crucifixion,
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   and it wasn't the Samaritans.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   It wasn't the Gentiles.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.280]   The people who were trying to ensnare Jesus were the leaders
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.280]   of the people of God.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.280]   Now take a moment to drink that in.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:20.280]   The people of God, these were the Israelites.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   So these Pharisees, the scribes, the Herodians, the Sadducees,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.280]   the priests, all these Jewish sects that were normally at odds
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.280]   with each other were unifying with this common goal to try to
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   ensnare Jesus at this moment in time.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.280]   They didn't simply want to trap him, though.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.280]   They actually wanted Jesus dead.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   Jesus knew this.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   Jesus knew intricately what was going on in the hearts of these people.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   He knew who these teachers and religious leaders were.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   He's known this way before, by the way.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   Jesus wasn't startled into this realization.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.280]   They were coming together to kill him.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   There's a unity in this desire that these men had.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.280]   In their hatred of God, seemingly morally upright people.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.280]   And these were people who saw Jesus' miracles.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   They saw his might, his kindness, his grace, his power and
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.280]   spirit-filled teaching, and they turned around and schemed
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.280]   together to kill him.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.280]   People who are waiting for the Messiah for years when they
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.280]   encounter the man who is systematically accomplishing all
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   that their word, all that the law and the prophets had described.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   When he comes into the world, the one that they were studying
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   day by day, when he arrives, they seethe in anger.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   They want him not just set aside, but they want him annihilated and killed.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.280]   And they overcome great obstacles and barriers to unify before Jesus.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:06.280]   Not to worship him, not to love him, but again, to murder him.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   This is the Messiah Jesus who imposes a threat on what they want.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.280]   A kingdom for themselves.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.280]   They want a physical kingdom with their names, their desires
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.280]   promoted, and turning to God only as a means of achieving their ends.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.280]   This is what these men were trying to do.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.280]   So on this day of Passion Week, this is what's heightening.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.280]   These people who say, "Lord, Lord," are the very ones who are out to ensnare
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.280]   and kill him, and it's shocking how deep their hatred goes.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   Now there's a passage in Matthew 11, verse 13 that shows how shocking this is.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   It says, "Then he said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.'
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal like the other."
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   Now who was this man? He was a leper.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.280]   This was an amazing miracle accomplishment.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.280]   Look at verse 14, look at how they turn around.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:04.280]   "But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him as to how they might destroy him."
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.280]   This is absurd.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   What is going on in the mind of Jesus then?
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.280]   Well, Jesus knew all of this about these religious leaders.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:19.280]   Jesus had come down in love to his people to extend a hand of grace and mercy
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.280]   to his people, and he had spent an entire earthly lifetime
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   wanting nothing more for than his people to come to know him.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.280]   Jesus had condescended to humanity.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.280]   He was born into the world as a helpless baby,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   spent a life laboring in the brokenness of this world, walking amongst sinners.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   The creator with creation, enduring temptations and trials and mockery and scorn.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.280]   And for all this mind-blowing effort of God who had come flesh to save them,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:59.280]   the response by the people he came to save was not surrender, love, and awe.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   Again, it was to crucify.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:10.280]   It would have been better maybe for there to be neglect or maybe ignorance, right?
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   It would have been better for someone just to turn away in apathy,
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:19.280]   but their response is so indicative of the sinner.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   It's kill.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   On this Tuesday morning, Jesus and the disciples wake up in Bethany.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   I put up a map as well.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   And they head back to Jerusalem and the temple, and on the way to Jerusalem,
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   they pass by the withered fig tree from yesterday.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.280]   I took a cue from Pastor Mark, and there's a tree.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   There it is for you.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   And as they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.280]   Being reminded, Peter said to him, "Rabbi, look, the fig tree which you cursed has withered."
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   So this was a blossomed, bloomed, full of leaves tree the day before,
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   and now they're passing by again the next day on Tuesday, and it had withered.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   Now he says, being reminded by Peter, who had said, "Rabbi, look, the fig tree which you cursed has withered,"
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   trying to show his disciples what happens to people who do not bear fruit,
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.280]   that the only end is death.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   It's judgment.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:38.280]   And they pass by this fig tree to the temple in Jerusalem, where the people of God are.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   They're gathered here because it's Passover time.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   And it says in Matthew 21, verse 23, "When Jesus entered the temple,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   the chief priests and the elders of the people, they come right up to him.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   They came to him while he was teaching, and Jesus sees that they're ready to ensnare and trap him today,
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   especially after what he did yesterday in cleansing of the temple."
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:06.280]   Jesus is a great threat to them, to their worldly kingdom.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.280]   See, these are people who want what they want.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.280]   God and his kingdom is not the end for these people.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.280]   Their own kingdom is their end. It's what they want.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:21.280]   And they attach God's name to it, and you see it very immediately in their very first exchange.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   In Matthew 21, verse 23, these men who had come up to Jesus,
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   they asked this question, "By what authority are you doing these things?
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   And who gave you this authority?"
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:37.280]   I mean, up to this point, anyone with a mustard seeds amount of faith would have been able to answer that question.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.280]   Who? Like, whose authority is he able to do this?
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   But because they don't like the message that he is the king, that he is the Lord, that he is the master,
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.280]   that it is Jesus' kingdom that Jesus comes for,
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.280]   they refuse to submit and bow the knee to Jesus, and they ask this question, "Then by whose authority?"
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   even though it should be so clear who he is by this point.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.280]   The true answer won't satisfy them.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:10.280]   So Jesus says, "I'm not going to tell you."
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   Why? Because he has already been given every evidence as to who he was.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.280]   And yet they were unwilling to yield and turn to him in faith.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   This is the unbeliever's heart.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   We have been given every ounce of evidence that is needed for us to place our faith in him,
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   to know who he is, to understand who we need,
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   and yet the sinner's reaction is to go after personal kingdom.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.280]   And if it means we've got to go through Christ, then so be it.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   And so Jesus answers in Matthew 21, 27, "Neither will I tell you then by what authority I do these things."
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   Jesus had come to show that he had enough.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   Before he goes to the cross, this Tuesday is when Jesus makes the clearest rebuke to these religious leaders.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   Jesus goes into many parables, actually, to describe it to them, but we're going to focus on two parables.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   The first parable is the vineyard landowner.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.280]   Jesus tells a parable of a vineyard landowner who goes on a journey, and let me read this for us.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.280]   In Matthew 21, 33, he says, "Listen to another parable.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.280]   There was a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a wall around it and dug a wine press in it
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:27.280]   and built a tower and rented it out to vine growers and went on a journey.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   Now when the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine growers to receive his produce.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   The vine growers took his slaves.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   They beat one, killed another, and stoned a third."
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:50.280]   So again, he sent another group of slaves larger than the first, and they did the same thing to them.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   But afterward, he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son."
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   But when the vine growers saw the son, they said amongst themselves, "This is the heir.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance."
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   They took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   Jesus is telling a parable to them, and it's pretty clear what he's trying to say to them, right?
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   They want the inheritance.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   Jesus knows this as he's looking at these leaders.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   They want Jesus' inheritance.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   They want Jesus' kingdom.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   They want the world that belongs to Christ.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.280]   Even though he is the Lord, these religious leaders want it all.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   They want the kingdom without the king.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   They want the perks of God's world without God or worship of God.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:47.280]   And Jesus is describing what they are willing to do to him.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   Jesus knows what he's walking into.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   He knew every step of the way what was going to happen to him, and yet he continues down this path.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   And so what is the answer they come up with when he asks this question?
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   Well, in verse 38, he says, "This is the heir.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   Come, let us kill him and seize an inheritance."
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   Jesus asks these Jewish leaders what that landowner will do.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   They're able to answer with remarkable clarity.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.280]   It's disturbing how well they understand what the landowner should do.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.280]   Listen in verse 41.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.280]   "The religious leaders said to him, 'He will bring those wretches to a wretched end
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   and will rent out the vineyard to other vine growers who will pay him the proceeds at the proper season.'"
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   And it says, "If we weren't clear that they understood that he was talking about them."
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.280]   Matthew 21, 45, "When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.280]   they understood that he was speaking about them."
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   Now, why do they not turn at this point?
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.280]   Parable number two, the wedding feast.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   Jesus goes on to tell in another parable, "A king is holding a wedding feast for his son.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.280]   He sends his slaves out to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast,
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.280]   but the people were unwilling to come.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   Then the king sends other slaves with more information."
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   These slaves, by the way, were alluding to past prophets of Israel.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   They had been given evidence after evidence, prophecy after prophecy,
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   all that they needed to believe that he is the Messiah.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   He fulfilled every single prophecy.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.280]   And those invited in this story, if we look at Matthew 22, 4, it says,
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:36.280]   "Tell those who have been invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   My oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   Come to the wedding feast.'
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   But these invited pay no attention to this invitation."
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   And instead, Jesus says three things happened.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   One, he owned a farm that he wanted to tend to.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.280]   Second person, he owned a business that he wanted to tend to.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   And the third one, the rest seized the slaves and killed them.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   And there it is again.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   They want their own life according to their own terms.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   They actually want nothing to do with God.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   They want nothing to do with the king.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   They want to live out their own lives.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   Remember, these are all describing these Jewish religious leaders.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   He's speaking inside of the temple at Jerusalem,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   at the most important Jewish festival season.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   It's the people who are supposed to be the closest to God,
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.280]   who are the most seething, who are the most scheming,
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   who are the clearest depiction of what a sinner looks like.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   These are men who honor God with their lips.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.280]   They say they love God, but they don't.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   They say, "Lord, Lord, did we not do all these things in your name?"
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.280]   And one day, Jesus will stare them back in the eyes,
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:57.280]   unflinching, and say, "I never knew you."
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.280]   The kingdom is reserved for those who love the Lord and live for him.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   The kingdom does not house people who live for their own kingdoms,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   who live for their own glory.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   And so what's the result?
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   Similar to the parable of the vineyard landowner,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.280]   the king sends his armies, destroys the murderers,
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   which is found in verse 7 of chapter 22.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   But the king was enraged.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   He was enraged, and it's obvious that he should be enraged.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.280]   He extends his hand of grace to these people to invite them
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.280]   to the wedding feast of his son, and that's how he treats them?
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.280]   That's how they treat them?
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   And it says, "And he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   and set their city on fire."
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:49.280]   And Jesus is telling this parable.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   The fig tree, the parable of the vineyard,
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   the parable of this wedding feast all ends in the same way.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   It's death. It's destruction.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.280]   It's judgment.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.280]   Jesus is saying, "This is what lays.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   This is what exists at the end for the sinner."
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:17.280]   And Jesus knows that as he's walking on the way to the cross,
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.280]   that for those he will lay down his life for,
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:25.280]   this is what he's facing.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.280]   It is not something he is just yelling out at a bunch of people.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   He is willing to lay down his life.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   The king sends his slaves to the main highways,
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.280]   inviting anyone who would come to the wedding,
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   those previously not invited.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   And this kingdom is reserved for those of faith.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   It doesn't matter what you look like on the outside.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.280]   The kingdom is for those who will place their faith in God
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   and give their lives up to God.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   It's for the ones who have traded in all things for God.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.280]   It's not for those who put up a religious show.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.280]   It is not for those who posture and pose.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:09.280]   It is for those who live for the king.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.280]   So this takes us into the afternoon of Tuesday.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.280]   He's been teaching all day long at the temple,
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.280]   this very temple just a day before where he had overturned those tables.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.280]   A full day's work of teaching done to this afternoon point.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   And Jesus caps it all off as if there were any question as to the message
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.280]   that he was trying to portray in Jerusalem that day in Matthew 23.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   I'll just read verses 2 through 7.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   Therefore, all that they tell you, do not observe."
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   This is no longer a parable.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   He says, "But do not do according to their deeds,
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   for they say things and do not do them.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.280]   They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders,
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men,
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   and respectful greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by men.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   And the result is a woe."
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.280]   Woe is an exclamation of grief.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:17.280]   It is literally a statement of intense hardship or distress.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   It's disaster being pronounced upon people.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.280]   You can think of it like how greatly one will suffer.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   He's pronouncing this kind of suffering and judgment.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   What terrible pain will come?
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.280]   Is this not clear enough?
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   Jesus has this on his mind,
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   saying, "This is what lies in wait for those who will not turn."
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   Seven times he pronounces these woes, a perfect number.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   Clearly stating that the proud and arrogant are not victims.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:57.280]   They are hard-hearted people who will bring judgment upon themselves.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.280]   He has spent this time exposing who they are and what their heart is like,
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   but these proud and arrogant people do not submit to the Lord.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.280]   And they will do anything in their power to make sure that they gain their kingdom.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.280]   They will, if there is no other option, eliminate the threat that stands before them,
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:22.280]   even if it is the Messiah himself, deceiving themselves into thinking or saying,
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.280]   into believing that perhaps this is not he,
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   even though every evidence was given to them.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.280]   That this man does not fit their agenda.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   This man does not fit the way they think their worship ought to be.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.280]   It is a supremely man-centered worship that they exist in.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   This is the heart of sin. This is the heart of the rebellion of mankind.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.280]   And God has been patient in his desire to extend grace and mercy for years and years.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.280]   And so he concludes in Matthew 23, 34, in this teaching.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   He says, "Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   and persecute from city to city, so that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth,
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah,
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.280]   whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   Verse 37, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings,
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   and you were unwilling. Behold, your house is being left to you desolate."
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.280]   This is Jesus' heart.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   It's angry.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:48.280]   And it is incredibly sad.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   The Lord's desire is for none to perish, but for all to come to repentance.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   Jesus is exposing his heart, not just of the Jews, but for the sinner.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.280]   Desiring to live my way. It's not just wayward living.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.280]   It's not just a flaw.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.280]   It's not just something to be rectified. It's not just something that we have to try better and harder.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   It is something that goes so much deeper than that.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   That this type of living Jesus is trying to describe, that it ends only in judgment.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   Why?
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   Because in the face of these religious leaders shows that for the sinner, it is not just a flaw.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:32.280]   It is a desire of the death of God in our lives.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:38.280]   Which we will see as we continue as he walks towards the cross.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.280]   This week, every step that Jesus takes is intentional.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   Every thought that he has, every word he speaks is an intentional thing that is accomplished sovereignly.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.280]   So, we come back to the slide.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   After Jerusalem, he's headed on his way back to Bethany.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   Perhaps on Tuesday, there's the most packed teaching and most described about what Jesus did.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   And so, we didn't even get to touch the Olivet Discourse.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   Maybe next year, we can do that.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   But they stop by on the Mount of Olives and look over the city of Jerusalem.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   And Jesus begins to describe to his disciples the one who do know who he is.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   The ones who have given up their lives to follow him.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   His true disciples.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.280]   What to look for.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   Because he's going to come back.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   That they have not yet seen him die.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   But to the ones who love him.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   And so, as he explains God's ultimate judgment that's coming.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   As he talks about this discourse.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   This judgment that's being reserved.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:06.280]   There is something afterwards that I like to think that the disciples saw.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:12.280]   That until that judgment day comes, we do still exist in a time of grace.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   Where the message of the cross still belongs.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.280]   Because there is hope.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   And there is grace.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   For anyone who today would turn their faith towards Christ.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   I wanted to conclude with Romans chapter 5 verse 6 through 8.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   You see, at just the right time when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   Though for a good person, someone might possibly dare to die.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.280]   But God demonstrates his own love for us in this.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.280]   While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   I hope that as we keep going through Wednesday and all the way to Good Friday and then Resurrection Sunday.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   That we remember this together.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.280]   That this is what Jesus was doing.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.280]   And on that cross we will see fury and we will see love.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:08.280]   And Jesus had all that in his mind as he looked upon his people.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   Let's pray.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:16.280]   Heavenly Father, I pray that you would help us to have the right mentality.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.280]   And God to have a humble posture.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:26.280]   That we would wonder again how our God, how our creator, our Lord, our Savior and Master could do this for us.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   And so God, even as we conclude in song.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:35.280]   I pray Lord that it would come from a deep place of deep seated worship.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.280]   In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.280]   We all stand for our closing praise.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:52:02.280]   Though the nations
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:07.280]   Though the nations rage
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:12.280]   Kingdoms rise and fall
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.280]   There is still one King
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   Reigning over all
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   Oh, I will not fear
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   For this truth remains
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   That my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:46.280]   None above Him, none before Him
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   All of time in His hands
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:53:00.280]   For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   All the power, all the glory
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   I will trust in His name
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:17.280]   For my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.280]   Though the dread
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   Though the dread of night
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   Overwhelms my soul
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   He is here with me
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:39.280]   I am not alone
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:44.280]   Oh, His love is sure
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:49.280]   And He knows my name
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:58.280]   For my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:03.280]   None above Him, none before Him
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:08.280]   All of time in His hands
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:18.280]   For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:23.280]   All the power, all the glory
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   I will trust in His name
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:35.280]   For my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:56.280]   Though I may not see
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   What the future brings
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:06.280]   I will watch and wait
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:11.280]   For the Savior King
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   Then my joy completes
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.280]   Standing face to face
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   In the presence of the Ancient
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.280]   of Days
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   None above Him, none before Him
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:40.280]   All of time in His hands
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.280]   All the power, all the glory
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:59.280]   I will trust in His name
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   For my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:17.280]   For my God is the Ancient of Days
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   Would you take a moment to pray on your own and I'll close us in prayer.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.280]   Amen.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.280]   Amen.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.280]   Amen.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.280]   Amen.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.280]   Amen.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   Amen.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   Amen.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.280]   Amen.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.280]   Amen.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:54.280]   [Silence]
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:20.280]   [Silence]
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:26.280]   So Father, as we continue just gathering together, what a joy and privilege it is to do that.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   God, I pray that the cross, though it happened 2,000 years ago, would have so much relevance for us,
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   not only at the moment of our conversion, but today.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   And so Lord, we want to thank you that you, our God, walked amongst us,
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   that you would care so much, that you would dwell amongst your people.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   And Father, that we will give you the worship that you rightly deserve.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   Alright, well tonight, again, we're going to be keeping this place open until 9.30 and we're shutting it down.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   So feel free to fellowship with one another until then, and we'll see you tomorrow night.
