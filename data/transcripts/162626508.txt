[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   4 and I'll be reading from verse 1 all the way down to verse 8 Romans chapter 4
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:16.240]   verses 1 through 8. Again reading out of the ESV. What then shall we say was
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.280]   gained by Abraham our forefather according to the flesh? For if Abraham
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.920]   was justified by works he has something to boast about but not before
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.120]   God. For what does the scripture say Abraham believed God and he was
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.840]   continued he was counted to him as righteousness. Now to him who works his
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.320]   wages are not counted as gift but as at his due and to the one who does not work
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.920]   but believes in him who justifies the ungodly his faith is counted as
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.280]   righteousness. Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.480]   counts righteousness apart from works. Blessed are those whose lawless deeds
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.160]   are forgiven and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man against whom the Lord
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.520]   will not count his sin. Let's pray.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.080]   Precious and loving Father we thank you so much for this morning we thank you
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.160]   for every morning Lord that we're able to rise and to breathe and have our
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.800]   being we know Father God that all things are created by you and for you so that
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.120]   our worship Lord God that we give to you may simply be a reasonable response to
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.760]   all that you've done and given to us. We pray that your word would speak to us
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.720]   it would convict it would encourage and strengthen your church Lord God that we
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.040]   may truly live a life worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Give us humble
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.520]   hearts moldable open ears Lord God that we may hear your voice and follow you
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.840]   in Jesus name we pray amen. You know I think many of you guys who are maybe
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.400]   bicultural maybe tricultural know that there are certain things maybe you know
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.600]   both languages well enough there are certain words that kind of symbolizes
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.800]   what that culture represents right I mean obviously you can't you can't
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.120]   contain a whole culture in one word but there are certain words that kind of
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.240]   gives you the heart of the culture and you know all these years that we've been
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.680]   coming in and out of China when I asked the Chinese students or the people in
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.520]   China you know what is a word that kind of captures your culture and the word
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.440]   that they use is guanxi and some of you guys may know that word and guanxi
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.040]   basically means relationship or connection and and so what it means is
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.000]   that in that culture they value connection and relationship so they
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.880]   invest so much time in that word in that relationship in guanxi. In India I asked
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.200]   them the same question is a what is a word that captures your culture I forgot
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.440]   the word but I remember the meaning very clearly the meaning of the word that
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.920]   they told me basically means it doesn't matter so initially I thought well what
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.600]   doesn't matter of course it matters that's why I'm asking you and I say well
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.280]   it doesn't matter right and it really does that more time I go and spend time
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.400]   in the Indian culture it really like they're not hurried about anything
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.520]   there's no sense of urgency just kind of doesn't matter you know they shake their
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.800]   heads back and forth left and right and it doesn't matter and it really does
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.400]   capture the heart of you know maybe the Hindu culture like everything says can I
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.200]   add these a time for everything if something bad happens you're gonna come
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.640]   back at something else and you know whatever the case it captures the
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.680]   culture you know I come from a Korean you know culture cultural background and
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.400]   if you ask Koreans what's a Korean word that captures the culture is the word
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.640]   Han Han and it's not Han Guk it's it's the Han is a different word Han and the
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.680]   word Han basically means a deep-rooted negatively put it means bitterness it
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.240]   means unfulfilled desire now you kind of understand why the Koreans are the way
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.960]   the Koreans are the word kind of you know in some sense it's like frustration
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.920]   longing that's basically if you ask again people in the Korean culture like
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.040]   I don't know second third generation may not know but the previous generation
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.680]   they'll tell you that word Han captures the culture when you understand the
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.440]   history behind the Korean culture you can understand why that word Han
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.680]   represents culture so if you ever watch Korean drama you ever noticed that it a
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.640]   lot of times it just doesn't end on a good note don't have like struggle to
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.520]   this guy and a girl try to get together and then at the end they get sick and
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.320]   they die you know like why why do they do that it's like well it's kind of like
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.800]   a Korean culture they're not used to in America you know you struggle and at the
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.200]   end you defeat everybody you're on the top in Korea you struggle you struggle
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.240]   and then the end you know if you look at the Korean culture you know like
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.440]   historically they've been you know dominated by bigger nations all
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.240]   throughout especially this generation the previous generation that lived
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.800]   through the Japanese occupation and the Korean War you know it was hard for me
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.280]   to understand growing up in the United States even though I was born in Korea
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.360]   growing up in the United States and working in a Korean church culture
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.960]   there's so many things that I didn't understand and one of the things I
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   didn't understand was they never thought about the future like what we do today
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   and how is that gonna affect tomorrow and again and I'm not talking about
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.280]   those in their 40s and 50s maybe not even 60 but my parents generation like
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.880]   70s and 80s like their their mindset was just today take care of today as long as
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.360]   everything's taking care of today and I understood more I understood the culture
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.520]   the whole generation of people who were old enough to remember the Korean War
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.040]   basically got the whole culture flipped upside down you know we're not just
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   talking about one city we're talking about the whole country for all the way
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.360]   from from the the tip of North Korea to the tip of South Korea all got mixed
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.700]   back and forth everybody had to back grab their bags rich and poor had to
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.800]   move up and down and then just arbitrarily one day we're gonna stop
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.840]   this war and drew a line right in the middle and if you happen to be caught on
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.080]   the left side you can't ever come back down and if you happen to be caught on
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.960]   the right side and you're separated from your mom or dad or uncle or whoever it
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.760]   was you can never see them again so we're not just talking about a small
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.360]   group of people we're talking about a whole country filled of people who've
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.920]   experienced this and so education their hospital system you know their their
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.600]   economy everything was flipped upside down and so everything that you see in
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.240]   South Korea if you've ever visited South Korea it was all within the last 30
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.200]   years so prior to that it was probably one of the one of the poorest countries
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.040]   in the world so I began to understand how much of that impacted the Korean
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.320]   culture at least in the previous generation now the reason why I share
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.840]   all of this with you is because when something traumatic happens and it could
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.440]   be something good or it can be something negative you know that that has made an
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.080]   impact and that's something that's in their psyches permanently at least
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.760]   during their life some of you may have experienced something like that in your
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.600]   life positive or negative and every time something happens you revert back to
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.120]   that particular event right what a good or bad and you know how that affects you
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.840]   I bring all this up again not to talk about the Korean culture not not even to
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.960]   talk about you or me when we think about God we typically think about God as a
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.800]   being as a thing as a force he's omnipotent he's omnipresent he's
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.080]   immutable and we talk about all these theological things about his attributes
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.320]   but one thing that we forget about who he is that he is a being that created us
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:39.000]   to be like him we have emotions because he has emotions and oftentimes the Bible
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.880]   describes him as grieving sometimes sad right broken over the sins of his people
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.600]   we look at Jesus who is the exact imprint of God actually even crying at
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:59.400]   times fatigue standing in front of the grave weeping a lot of times you know we
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.160]   read about that but we don't know what to do with that because we oftentimes
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:11.400]   think of God as a force so when we think about God who is emotional you know you
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.680]   think about the pain that we have the things that we've experienced and and
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:20.200]   how it affected us what to really understand the heart of God like heart
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.000]   of God not just not just kind of like oh he is this is who he is theologically
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.280]   but really know the heart of God what is something revealed to us in Scripture
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.560]   that would have made that kind of impact that that kind of like is an overarching
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.040]   thing that may be in the back of his mind if we can even say that at all
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:47.480]   times I can think of two particular events the first one is a fall of Satan
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.000]   in Ezekiel chapter 28 13 to 17 he says you were in Eden the Garden of God every
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.120]   precious stone was your covering Sardis topaz diamond barrel oinks Jasper
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.360]   sapphire emerald carbonicle whatever whatever that is crafted in gold were
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.280]   your settings and your engravings on the day that you were created they were
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.600]   prepared so in other words he said all of these precious stones were created to
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.560]   celebrate the creation of Satan you were blameless in your ways from the day you
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.520]   were created till unrighteousness was found in you your heart was proud
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   because of your beauty you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   splendor I cast you to the ground now we read that and we think of what that must
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.720]   be a tremendous event that took place in history but we often forget that the
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.960]   scripture says that God created him and loved him and created all this precious
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.160]   stone to celebrate him and yet imagine that he would challenge God because he
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.120]   wanted to be like him and as a result of that not only did he fall he brought
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.240]   corruption to third of the angels and then he brought crush him to mankind and
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.600]   ever since then he's been leading this rebellion against God so that they can
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.360]   be like God again in Isaiah 14 12 it says how you are fallen from heaven all
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.240]   day star son of dawn how you are cut down to the ground you who laid the
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.920]   nation's low you said in your heart I will send to heaven above the stars of
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.160]   God I will set my throne on high I will sit on the Mount of Assembly in the far
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.000]   reaches of north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will make myself
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.920]   like the most high some of your translations translated that word son of
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.040]   dawn as Lucifer where we commonly refer to Satan as Lucifer and he says his
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:44.120]   primary rebellion was he wanted to exalt himself now how much of that has affected
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.320]   what we understand in the presentation of the gospel the other traumatic
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.160]   event that took place in redemptive history is that that's the one the fall
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.280]   of Satan that affected all of his creation but the other event is Jesus on
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:07.760]   the cross can you possibly imagine anybody who has a child that you would
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:14.520]   send your only begotten son to be crucified to be taunted to be beaten
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.160]   stripped naked put on the cross and then not only did he allow this to happen
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.360]   that he himself had to draw near and he didn't need to punish his son put the
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.600]   sins of mankind past present and future upon this child his only begotten child
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:37.400]   so that you and I can be saved if you look at these two events that made an
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:43.000]   impact in human history and you consider that this this is probably overarching
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.280]   thing in God's mind here's this one event that desires to exalt himself and
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.840]   extend is leading the rebellion against God wanting to exalt themselves to be
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:01.560]   like God and here's Christ that he presented to exact to counter that
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   rebellion and his path to life was the exact opposite of the rebellion of Satan
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.000]   so if you want to follow me if you want to live you must first learn to die he
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.160]   who seeks his life shall lose and he loses his life for my sake shall find it
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.240]   repentance isn't simply identifying certain sins in our lives and say you
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.320]   know what I lied here I cheated there and I did this I should have done that I
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.880]   had lustful thoughts justification by faith first and foremost is to recognize
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:37.240]   not only particular things that we've done but their whole life trajectory is
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:42.640]   a rebellion against God you may not have done anything to deserve life sentence
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.080]   you may not have done anything to for the police to pull you over and be
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.400]   sentenced to jail but our whole rebellion against God led by Satan
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.360]   himself is to be like God is to exalt ourselves how much of our energy and
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:05.000]   time and sacrifice and planning has to do with making ourselves better
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.040]   sometimes even in the church to exalt ourselves to make more money to be
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.680]   better than our neighbors and our friends to go to the better school to be
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.800]   more educated in and of itself it sounds innocent but when you look deep at the
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:27.120]   core of what Satan's rebellion is so much of the temptation in the world is
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.960]   in the context of this rebellion against God so therefore when Jesus Christ came
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.720]   he says if you want to follow me if you want to live you pick up your cross and
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.240]   you also follow me that's why when you look at the beginning of salvation
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.080]   justification by faith that our righteousness only given to us he said
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.480]   over and over again in chapter 3 in chapter 4 he says that no one can boast
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   nobody the beginning of life is the death of our former life that's why
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.880]   every time we get baptized we are baptized into his death in order that we
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.480]   may live in the resurrected life of Christ so beginning of life is death of
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.240]   our old life recognizing that we are no longer living in a bit rebellion against
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.560]   God but now we humble ourselves now we add nothing to our life we surrender so
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:23.640]   it is no mistake that Paul spends three four five six chapters laying the
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:30.920]   foundation of why you must first die why you must no longer strive to be
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:36.760]   somebody why there is no boasting in this new life because it is this
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.920]   rebellion that Satan is leading this world in which is causing the curse of
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:49.200]   mankind chapter 4 Paul is going to present Abraham as a prime example of
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.720]   why justification by faith makes sense and there's three things I don't want to
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.920]   cover this this morning of why Paul presents Abraham and again Abraham is
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.120]   not unique to this particular passage Abraham as an example is given to us
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.200]   over and over again in the New Testament but I want to talk about three
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.800]   particular reasons why Abraham is given to us in this text to confirm
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.320]   justification by faith why salvation is by works and not by by faith and not by
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.880]   works right so the passage Romans chapter 4 3 is that for what does the
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.840]   scripture say Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:33.040]   that specific verse is a direct quote from Genesis chapter 15 5 and 6 and that
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.240]   verse is repeated again in Galatians chapter 3 verse 6 and James chapter 2 23
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:44.600]   so the first thing that we want to look at is that even Abraham even Abraham the
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.680]   father of Israel could only be made righteous by faith and not by works now
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.640]   why even Abraham because the rabbis at that time of some of them were teaching
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:04.600]   that Abraham had no need for repentance if there was anybody that could come
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.440]   before God by his own merit it would be Abraham and they would actually
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.280]   disseminate and teach this was a common understanding in this Jewish community
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.680]   now they weren't saying that they were without sin but they were saying that if
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.400]   we continue to obey the law and keep it perfectly we can be like Abraham one day
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.520]   and that we would also be able to earn our righteousness so what Paul is doing
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.800]   in chapter 4 that even Abraham that you are looking up to even he can only be
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:39.640]   justified by faith and not by his works I mean he was a perfect example of man
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.600]   of obedience he was a rich man you know it wasn't like he was a poor man he had
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.640]   nothing to lose and God said follow me into the into the wilderness into the
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   desert no he said the context of Genesis 15 5 and 6 whereas he was already a rich
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:59.000]   man not only was he rich his father was rich so when God called him out he was
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.080]   simply because God believed or Abraham believed God he left everything walked
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.840]   out into the desert where it was unsafe there were bandits there were other
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.840]   kings mightier than he was and and we see in his Abraham's life journey there
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.560]   several times he could have been completely crushed why would a rich man
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.000]   leave all of that and walk on to the desert simply because God said to come
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.040]   follow me and he said he believed him and it was said he said it was his
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.880]   belief not at the end of his life after he's proven everything he says no at the
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:37.400]   very beginning because he believed what God said so what Paul is saying here is
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:45.520]   from the very beginning that even Abraham even Abraham in our culture if
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.520]   we were talking about who's the most moral person that you say you know what
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.680]   that person if anybody could be saved it should be that person you know all the
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.120]   times the term or mother Teresa term comes around that anybody does any good
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.840]   works like oh he's mother Teresa you know I mean you feed the poor always
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.960]   mother Teresa because she has a reputation gave up everything walked
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.680]   into Calcutta and given her life to feed the poor you know when I was younger the
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.240]   man's name that constantly came up in that concept was Albert Schweitzer so
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.320]   some of you guys may have heard his name may not have heard his name but Albert
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:27.520]   Schweitzer was a philosopher he was a renowned musician he was to some degree
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.840]   a theologian and then at some point he became a physician now and he was an
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.280]   expert in all of these fields and that's why we know about him that's why the
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.040]   world knew about him he could have been famous in every one of those situations
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.160]   he decided to become a medical doctor because he wanted to serve the poor in
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.240]   Africa he got his medical degree again this he was already a renowned musician
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.880]   we were now a philosopher and he decided to give up all that become a doctor
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.920]   specifically to serve the poor in Africa he lived there for 40 years and he died
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:06.360]   there serving the poor in Africa he died sometime in 1960s and the huge debate at
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.560]   that time was because he was a liberal theologian he denied the resurrection of
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.240]   Jesus Christ he denied the deity of Jesus and in doing so he denied the
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.680]   atonement of Christ he saw Jesus as a powerful historical figure kind of like
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.080]   the way Gandhi described Jesus and so there was a there was a discussion
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:31.640]   within the Christian community that if anybody has worked enough to earn
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:38.440]   salvation before God wouldn't it be Albert Schweitzer who left everything to
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:45.600]   do good in this world and the answer was clearly no because when the scripture
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:51.360]   says all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God that includes Albert
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:58.880]   Schweitzer that includes mother Teresa and that includes even Abraham that the
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:05.960]   only hope for mankind is Christ crucified the salvation by faith and by
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:12.080]   faith alone is not simply for those few people so that's what Paul has been
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.640]   presenting for three chapters all have sinned all have sinned the rich the poor
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.600]   the educated the moral and the immoral the educated than and educated
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.000]   uneducated talented the untalented people of significance people of
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.520]   insignificance all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God you know when
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.160]   I was younger I first became a Christian this first thing that one of the first
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.240]   things that I wrestled with because if I was to think about somebody who was
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.880]   moral you know really upright this is person that I remember my dad was used
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.440]   to work in this medical you know packaging company and I worked there for
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.680]   a little bit when I was younger and he would always bring his Bible and he was
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.040]   always upright everybody knew it's like that guy was just upright man he was
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.880]   always I always see him praying always evangelizing and doing all this stuff so
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.760]   when I became a Christian the first guy that I thought about was him you know
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.520]   that guy is a he that guy's a serious Christian and then when I told him and I
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.640]   was in a conversation with him I realized he was a Jehovah Witness you
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.600]   know growing up in a Christian home automatically it's like oh he's a
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.400]   Jehovah Witness you know I didn't know a whole lot about Jehovah Witnesses all I
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.120]   knew was they were wrong I didn't know why they were wrong but they were wrong
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:33.840]   but it really caused me to question here's a guy that to me seems like he's
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   taking his faith seriously he's evangelizing and then I see all these
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.360]   people at church in my eyes are hypocrites so you're telling me here's
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.080]   this guy who's who's like dedicating his life doing this thing but because he has
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   the wrong theology he's gonna go to hell and here are these people is like oh one
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.280]   saved always saved and that church and always like fighting in the church it
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.360]   was like they're gonna be saved I just didn't make any sense to me right and
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.880]   really shook me up and I wanted to just you know study the scripture see what it
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:10.640]   says and and in the end the answer is crystal clear just like the greatest of
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:16.120]   the Pharisees just like Abraham Isaac and Jacob there is not a single one that
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.260]   can stand before this Holy God and say look what I have done see that's the
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.960]   beginning of the gospel and that was a problem with the early church because
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.000]   the Judaizers didn't understand it either for hundreds of years they've
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.520]   been trying to obey the law for hundreds of years they wouldn't do anything on
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.800]   the Sabbath they wouldn't eat before even if they were poor they wouldn't
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.880]   work on the Sabbath because they were trying to keep the law the Pharisees or
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.840]   the ones who were fasting every Tuesday and Thursday how many people do you know
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.880]   that fast regularly like that they gave to the to the temple they even did
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:58.040]   missions to proselyte to convert people to Judaism they were doing this for
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.440]   hundreds of years and the Pharisees were doing this excellently in the human eyes
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:09.200]   and yet here comes Jesus and here comes Apostle Paul and the Apostles and said
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.080]   no all of that is worthless all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.440]   God so if you look in the early church Paul had to constantly deal with this
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:25.040]   Judaizers that your good works in the presence of God is nothing in fact Paul
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   says in Philippians 3 3 to 7 for we are the real circumcision basically what
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.160]   he's doing is he's Judaizers saying like no we have all these good works and Paul
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.880]   says no way that is not the right way that is not the way of salvation but if
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.480]   you want to go toe-to-toe if you think that maybe I'm holding on to the grace
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.440]   of God because I can't earn it my way like like the way you're doing it let's
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.640]   go right so he's comparing he says though I myself a reason to have
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.840]   confidence in the flesh also if anyone thinks he has reason for confidence in
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.480]   the flesh I have more circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel the
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.800]   tribe of Benjamin Hebrew of Hebrews as to the law a Pharisee as to the zeal
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.640]   persecutor of the church as to righteousness under the law blameless
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:17.640]   now we've we dance a that's an exaggeration really blameless now if he
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.520]   was really blameless he wouldn't need Jesus right but when he said blameless
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:28.640]   he's saying in comparison to you I did everything I was supposed to do in fact
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:34.880]   I even murder because I thought that somehow that was what God wanted me to
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:43.120]   do and yet he says I gained nothing I counted as loss for the sake of Christ
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:49.560]   see Paul realized not only could he not be saved by his own righteousness he
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:55.600]   realized that he was chosen because of his sin in first Timothy 1 15 through 17
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.480]   Paul describes himself as a chief of sinners he says the saying is trustworthy
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.440]   and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:13.880]   sinners of whom I am the foremost and I initially think like is exaggerating I
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:19.720]   mean he's the foremost but if you really think about who Paul was before he met
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:26.120]   Christ he really was he was a murderer right he was willing to kill and beat
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:32.080]   and drag people into prison who was proclaiming the gospel so he says I was
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.320]   chosen because I was the foremost of sinners and the reason why that Jesus
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.440]   Christ may display his perfect patience as an example of those who are to
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.240]   believe in him for eternal life he was chosen because of his sin it wasn't
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.400]   because he had status you would think like Oh Paul he converted he's so well
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.600]   connected he can go into these cities and have the protection of the Sanhedrin
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.920]   let's let's take advantage of that Paul's a Roman citizen he can go
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.840]   anywhere he wants he has money so you don't have to worry about money his
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.840]   parents are well connected but none of that he says no I wasn't chosen for that
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.760]   reason I was chosen for the exact opposite because I was a chief of
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:20.120]   sinners reason why for 17 to the king of ages immortal invisible the only God be
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.800]   honor and glory forever and ever amen
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:32.160]   beginning of salvation and understanding of the gospel is recognizing that
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:38.760]   everything that we have is worthless until we first die until we are first
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:44.440]   crucified with Christ our experience our education can be the greatest hindrance
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:51.840]   in coming to Christ because it makes us proud your talents your money even your
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.640]   age all of this can be a hindrance in coming to Christ if we don't first and
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.200]   foremost recognize that we have nothing to add does he really need my money does
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.680]   God not have enough experience is he not talented enough is he not smart enough
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.320]   for us to think that somehow if the right people with right talent and right
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.160]   experience if they convert somehow somehow they're gonna make a huge impact
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:22.120]   in the kingdom no first and foremost it humbles us until it humbles us we will
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:30.760]   not truly repent you know when I was a third grader in Philadelphia I was asked
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.800]   to join this play that was gonna be given in front of the whole community
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.120]   not just our school but all the parents were gonna come and I was so proud of
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.920]   that you know and I have no idea why they chose me I thought oh they they're
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.600]   finally recognizing my talent you know so yeah I didn't know if they asked me
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.800]   to join and then I was able to take a certain part of the day off so that I
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.760]   can go to the assembly and then you know so that was a benefit I didn't have to
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.520]   be in class so I said great I don't know what it is but they must have seen
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:06.280]   something in me right and then as they were practicing I started to dawn on me
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.900]   the reason why they chose me was because I was Asian because the play was the
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.280]   king and I I don't know if you guys know that thing is you know but so you know
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.800]   they basically had three choices they had my younger brother Philip which was
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:24.160]   too young my older brother Paul who was too old so the only other Asian that
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.640]   qualified was me I was a third grader so all of a sudden when I realized the
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.600]   reason the only reason why they chose me is because I was a little bit more
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.940]   tinted than the other children you know what I mean so I looked a little bit I
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.180]   looked apart and that's why they chose me and I remember that day when I found
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:47.500]   that out I went from like yes you chose me you finally recognized me and then
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:54.760]   all of a sudden that was the only criteria you because you're Asian and
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.180]   you look different you kind of look that part and then you know what's
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.260]   interesting was I remember who was on the stage and the other children and I
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.500]   was the only Asian I was the only agent so all the day couldn't find the other
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:11.380]   Asians I was the only Asian on that thing I mean as goofy as that story may
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:18.900]   be you know the gospel first and foremost humbles all of us and if it
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.620]   doesn't humble us the very thing that you hold on to thinking that somehow you
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:28.740]   can add to the kingdom of God because you have this is going to be the very
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:34.220]   thing that stumbles you from that moment moment on it's a very thing that causes
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.580]   you to not be able to see who Jesus is it's the very things that you are good
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:45.100]   at that becomes your greatest stumbling block see to the early church the
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.300]   Pharisees their greatest stumbling block is their morality because they kept the
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:56.980]   law so vigorously and so they couldn't understand how can that not add anything
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.780]   to my salvation so the first and foremost he takes an example of Abraham
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.260]   because Abraham was at the pinnacle of what they believed to be a righteous
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.340]   person he says no not even Abraham the second thing that we learn about
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:16.140]   Abraham and justification by faith is Abraham's righteousness by salvation
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:23.460]   teaches us that God's salvation plan was not new it's always been Hebrews
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:28.420]   chapter 13 8 it says of Jesus Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:37.540]   and forever justification by faith was not something brand new that that God
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.260]   was introducing you he didn't have plans to you know if these guys just obey my
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.100]   law that somehow I'm able to save them and everything could be restored and
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.940]   then these guys keep failing so I have to have another plan let's go to plan B
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:57.060]   Jesus Christ crucified was never plan B he didn't have a plan B from the very
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:04.740]   beginning in Genesis chapter 15 5 & 6 before he went out into the desert this
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.860]   is what it says and he brought him outside and said look toward heaven this
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.820]   is God speaking to Abraham and number the stars if you are able to number them
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.860]   then he said to them you shall so shall your offering be and he believed the
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:20.940]   Lord and he counted it to him as righteousness see he was counted
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:27.260]   righteous before he went not after right before so from the very beginning
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:32.220]   he says no salvation and righteousness is by faith but it didn't start with
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:37.340]   Abraham either if you look at scripture you'll see that from the very beginning
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:44.140]   as soon as they fall the proto evangelium in Genesis chapter 3 15 God
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.340]   says he's going to bring the seed of the woman he's gonna crush the head of the
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:53.820]   serpent and it was it was the pre gospel and all of the Old Testament is a
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:58.980]   fulfillment of that promise so again you know you think about like why are there
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.100]   so many genealogies in the Old Testament it was not because they're trying to
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:06.420]   fill in time you know like your pages you know have so many pages so hey is a
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.740]   good place for genealogy sometimes we read genealogies like like what is this
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.980]   I'm not related to these people I don't care about this genealogy the genealogies
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:20.940]   are important because genealogies connect us to that promise and it was a
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:26.100]   it was a precise record of how that promise of the seed was going to come
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.820]   and how that's connected to Jesus and that's why the very first page of the
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:37.140]   New Testament begins with the genealogy Jesus is the fulfillment of that promise
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:46.580]   so his plan of salvation was always Christ crucified and it never changed in
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:52.020]   Habakkuk verse chapter 2 verse 4 said but the righteous shall live by faith
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.860]   that's in the Old Testament not the New Testament that passage is is talked to
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:05.020]   us repeated in Romans 1 17 Galatians 3 11 Hebrews 10 38 and Psalm 49 7 through
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:10.380]   9 it says truly no man can ransom another or give to God a price of his
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:16.500]   life this is in the Old Testament a man cannot redeem himself and he cannot
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.860]   redeem another it is not possible for the ransom of their life is costly and
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.860]   can never suffice that he should live on forever and never see the pit and so
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:32.820]   there by your righteousness by your sacrifice you cannot be saved a lot of
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:36.660]   times we read the Old Testament as if it's disconnected with a New Testament
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.980]   you know and I and I saw that when I was younger when I first became a Christian
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.180]   I read the Old Testament it's like what God seems very different you know Old
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.740]   Testament there's judgment you know like they come he wipes out nations and then
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.460]   we come to the New Testament it seems like Jesus was crucified and he loves
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.460]   us unconditionally at least that's how I saw it you know and I saw a different
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.860]   picture you know people again say that a lot of times you know I've been hearing
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.940]   more and more how people are scared of me you know because I have a genetic
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:11.580]   disorder right here where there's like a I got a permanent scowl on my face so if
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:17.700]   I'm not laughing I look mad you know I remember a good friend that became a
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.940]   friend of mine you know he's the missions director of Southern Baptists
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:26.220]   in this area this guy is 6 feet 3 he's almost 300 pounds I mean intimidating
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:30.820]   big guy and the first time I went to India he said he was intimidated by me
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:37.340]   I like what and he said the reason why he said it's like I my countenance is
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.340]   very serious that's what he said that's exactly the words he my countenance is
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.340]   very serious I've never heard that phrase like that way before basically
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:50.380]   what he means is like you look angry that's what he means so you know
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.580]   sometimes they people perceive me a certain way because of certain things
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.300]   and then you know even Esther said that because she knew me as a pastor before
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.580]   we had any kind of relationship so she thought I was serious all the time and
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.820]   then once we started dating so you're the biggest goofball I've ever met my
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.060]   life and then so my perception was very different right a lot of times people
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.140]   see the Old Testament in a kind of superficial way and they don't see the
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:17.020]   connection to the New Testament and then if you talk to the you know the secular
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.460]   historians they'll say oh you know Judaism was like this and then the New
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.620]   Testament started in the time of Christ not realizing the connection between
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:29.140]   Judaism and Christianity that Christianity was simply a fulfillment of
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:36.300]   Judaism and it is clearly stated in Scripture that God's plan of salvation
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.220]   from the very get-go in Ephesians chapter 1 it says before the creation of
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:45.380]   the world this is what God had planned it never changed the only difference was
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.900]   at the dispensation of how he was carrying it out in the Old Testament he
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.260]   was preparing for the coming of Christ in a New Testament we're talking about
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:59.820]   the Christ who came but it is the same and there is a clear connection that
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:06.220]   Abraham not only the Jews not only Paul not only us but even Abraham and all the
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:11.060]   forefathers before him and after him are saved the same way by the blood of
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:18.660]   Christ you know we have children being born in our church seems like every
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.860]   other day right that's that seems like right and it's it's always great when we
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.740]   see the baby for the first time and the first thing that we see when we look at
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:33.020]   children is who do they look like right so we saw man Hannah's baby recently and
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.620]   the first thing we were oh we see that nose looks like Matt or you know the
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:41.420]   years or Hannah or you know that smell definitely is Matt or whatever like we
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:46.220]   we look at that and we kind of like certain things remind us of of the
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.980]   parents right now my children are a little bit older and so they behave a
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.740]   certain way and and so you know I I remember you know I don't remember when
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:01.380]   I was 2 or 3 or whatever but I remember when I was 14 or 15 or 16 and and you
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.460]   know there are certain things that because Zachary kind of had my second
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.580]   child it's kind of like my temperament you know everyone wants to know Esther
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.660]   we frustrated I don't know why he does that and I'm just sitting in the back
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:16.620]   it's like I know exactly why he's doing that because I remember I remember what
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.140]   I was like at that time you know you kind of you can kind of see the
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:26.860]   connection with the parents you know and I remember now that I'm 48 that I don't
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.380]   remember what my parents are 16 or 15 but I remember when they were this age
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.340]   because I was older and there's certain things about my dad's mannerism my dad
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.180]   was a pastor too so I remember very distinctly when he preached in his
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:42.420]   mannerisms and there are certain things that he does that I just unconsciously
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.380]   do like right here let's just hand in my pants right here like it just happens
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:54.220]   naturally it's genetic I didn't realize this was genetically passed down and
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.780]   and there are certain things that he does like the way he pulls his pants up
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.300]   when he was alive he used to pull his pants up and the way he was to go around
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:08.580]   his belly I catch myself doing the same thing I put my pants up and as I'm doing
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:14.660]   is I my dad used to do the same thing and then you know I remember when I was
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.580]   younger when my dad was a little bit older and he was being to have bad
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:23.260]   eyesight he would take his glasses off and he was squinting like this you know
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:28.300]   and I remember very distinctly going to my grandmother's house my dad's mother
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.220]   and my grandmother would do the same thing she would take her glass off and
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.180]   she would like that before she would talk and I would remember watching my
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.340]   dad and watching my grandma and saying like they're related you know that's
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.300]   where he gets it and there's a connection even with my nephews you know
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.300]   because there's blood relationship and there's some things that I noticed with
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:53.940]   their parents and my brothers and all this stuff you can't fool blood you
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:59.380]   can't fool blood because it's passed down see Jesus says to these Pharisees
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:03.180]   the reason why you don't understand me is because you don't understand my
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:10.340]   father I say nothing of my own accord I only say what he told me to say and
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:15.500]   Jesus says that he came and he's an exact representation the God that you've
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.060]   been supposedly worshipping from a distance has drawn near to you and you
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.860]   don't recognize him and the reason why you don't recognize him is because you
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:29.540]   were never worshipping my father he says in John chapter 8 39 to 43 they
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:33.460]   answered him Abraham is our father Jesus said to them if you were Abraham's
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.820]   children you would have you would be doing what Abraham did but now you seek
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:42.340]   to kill me a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God this is not
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:47.340]   what Abraham did you are doing what your father did they said to him we were not
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.020]   born of sexual immorality we have one father even God Jesus said to them if
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.820]   God were your father you would love me for I came from God and I am here I came
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:04.220]   not on my own accord but he sent me in other words if you knew my father you
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:10.060]   would know that what I am saying is not new if you knew my father you would be
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:16.100]   able to recognize that I am from him but because you don't know him you have
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:22.540]   nothing to do with Abraham you don't recognize me either see this
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:28.340]   justification by faith was not new God didn't change his plan his nature his
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.620]   character they were all perfectly represented in Christ and so the reason
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.280]   why Paul brings up Abraham is that these people were clinging to Abraham for their
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:45.060]   hope and he says no not even Abraham he's he is of the same Romans chapter
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.700]   four six three not only Abraham but he says of David David also speaks of the
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.500]   blessing of the one whom God counts righteousness apart from works blessed
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.780]   are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:02.180]   blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin not only Abraham
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:10.100]   but even the greatest king of Israel understood this Isaiah chapter 118 come
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:14.540]   now let us reason together says the Lord though your sins are like scarlet they
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.380]   shall be as white as snow though they are red like crimson they shall become
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.060]   like wool those of you who've been studying Isaiah with us you know that
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.780]   this passage is in the context of chapter after chapter after chapter of
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:33.860]   warning of judgment coming upon Israel because of their sin yet even in the
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:39.140]   context of judgment that he is proclaiming he's pleading with his
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:46.420]   people come now let us reason together because God's desire even in judgment
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:53.300]   is to forgive them is to bring them to himself and this is the same God of the
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:42:02.420]   cross this is the same message of salvation see Jonah Jonah you guys know
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.220]   the story of Jonah Jonah hated the Assyrians and rightfully so it kind of
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:11.340]   like today you have the Assyrians you know the the Isis were going around
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:16.620]   there beheading people women children burning down churches just so that they
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:22.260]   can intimidate other people force them to convert or to just dominate them so
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.460]   when we think about the terrorists we think of yet if anybody deserves
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:31.180]   judgments these people Assyrians were exactly the same the Syrians would
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:36.740]   crucify people burn them cut off their limbs and they would do it publicly so
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.740]   that everybody was walking around say if you mess with us this is what happens to
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:45.940]   you so they were known as a terrorist of that time so when God told Jonah to go
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.940]   to Syria we don't understand that he didn't want to go he didn't want them to
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:55.940]   repent so he goes reluctantly he preaches the warning the whole city
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.540]   comes to repentance and the response of Jonah in chapter 4 of 1 and 2 it says
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:07.460]   but it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was angry and he prayed to the Lord
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:13.300]   and said O Lord is not this what I said when I was yet in my country that is why
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.380]   I made haste to flee to Tarshish for I knew that you are a gracious God and
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.380]   merciful slow to anger abounding in steadfast love and relenting from
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:31.540]   disaster Jonah knew Jonah knew this God that he knew that if they would just
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:39.500]   repent even the Assyrians even these decapitators these terrorists that he
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:46.060]   would even forgive them see Jonah knew this the other prophets knew this
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:53.500]   Abraham knew this Moses news this see this salvation by faith alone was not a
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:59.180]   new product of the New Testament it wasn't plan B or C that was his plan
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:04.140]   from the very beginning and that's why he bringing in Abraham that this is not
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:09.380]   new third and finally Abraham's righteousness by faith teaches that
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:15.060]   works comes as a result of faith not faith as a result of righteousness okay
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:21.100]   so I'm gonna go through this last part but briefly now if Abraham is saved by
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.100]   faith now today when we say saved by faith is like well say by faith in what
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:31.100]   right we'll say okay Jesus Christ Son of God came emptied himself he was
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.340]   crucified for our sin he would no sin became sin that we might become the
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.820]   righteousness of God and so we memorize these scriptures he was crucified
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.180]   resurrected in the third day that we may also live with him eternity so we know
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:48.940]   the gospel what did Abraham confess if we're saved by the same faith and we
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.660]   were to ask the Old Testament Saints how are you saved he said well they're saved
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:59.140]   by faith faith in what because they never confessed Jesus they I don't
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.220]   remember any one of them saying that he's resurrected on the third day so
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:07.780]   that we may have resurrected life right if you look at Genesis 15 5 and 6 what
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:14.500]   did he believe God said come with me right come with me and I will make your
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.660]   descendants outnumber the stars Genesis 12 says I will bless you and many other
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.220]   nations will be blessed through you and he left everything and followed God and
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:30.180]   he said because of that it was credited to him as righteousness so faith of
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:39.300]   Abraham and the Saints was a broader belief in God that I trust God that even
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.220]   as I offer up my son I knew that even if he died if he wanted to he can resurrect
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:49.500]   him from the dead so I would even give my son and so he believed God and
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.780]   because he believed God he followed God he obeyed God and so when the scripture
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.740]   says in the Old Testament that their faith made them righteous it is a much
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:04.580]   bigger picture so does that negate the atonement of Christ obviously not
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:10.580]   because part of that faith was the belief that if you sacrificed that God
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:16.140]   would atone for your sins we come to the New Testament and we have narrowed our
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:23.940]   faith to a few theological statements that if we believe that Jesus Christ was
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.860]   crucified on the cross he was resurrected the third day in a tomb for
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:31.660]   my sin and I believe that then you are saved and all this other stuff doesn't
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:37.860]   really matter too much so we have narrowed faith to that and if you
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:44.900]   confess that one saved always saved right now let me take that and expand it
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:51.260]   because this is an extremely extremely important point how easy was it for you
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:47:00.580]   to believe that God of the universe sent his only begotten son right to die for
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:07.220]   undeserving sinners like you and me and we say I believe that yes I believe that
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:13.220]   and then we just raise our hand and just just receive it and then we say Jesus
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:22.180]   follow me follow me if you want to live follow me hmm not sure seek his funder
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:27.980]   first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you hmm it's
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:33.820]   hard to believe right hard to believe really if I give up everything and
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:39.100]   follow you you're gonna provide everything that's hard to believe right
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:45.620]   so Romans chapter 8 it says he who do not spare his own son how will he not
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:52.860]   along with him give him all things which is harder to believe which is harder to
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:58.940]   believe that Jesus Christ the Son of God died for sinners like you and me or that
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:05.580]   the God that we proclaim created the universe can take care of us if we
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:15.140]   follow him why is it so easy and so convenient to say I believe that I
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:20.620]   believe that I believe that's why I'm saved but when it comes to this tiny
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:25.980]   little thing that this God said follow me I mean if I gave you my son do you
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.980]   think I would withhold anything I give you a billion dollars you think I'm
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:34.980]   gonna be concerned about ten bucks I gave you a billion bucks you see why
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:41.700]   faith that does not produce works doesn't make sense it is inconsistent if
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:46.260]   it is genuine faith that we were able to believe this and says yes you died for
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:50.900]   me and have such a hard time believing that if we follow him that he has the
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:57.740]   best for us and then to say I don't know if I can believe that can that be true
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:07.020]   faith can that be true faith see Abraham believed and so he left everything
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:14.300]   follow even his only son I trust you and within that trust he provided a way of
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:21.060]   salvation in the blood of Christ so for us we look at it this way yes believing
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:28.020]   in God is much bigger than just a statement a few statement because if you
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:35.060]   really believe in that statement how will he not how will we not believe all
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:41.140]   the little things that come along with that does that make sense it is
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:46.660]   inconsistent to profess Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior who died for me
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:53.260]   unconditionally saved and my faith is justified by faith alone and then not to
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:58.980]   follow him see that's what faith in Abraham that's why Abraham is brought
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:04.820]   because Abraham is the perfect picture perfect example of salvation by faith
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:09.180]   let me invite I want to invite you guys to come and take take some time to pray
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:13.700]   with me and again you know the things that we're talking about Sunday morning
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.900]   may not be anything particularly new to you sometimes we know bits and pieces
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.580]   but but we don't have it all together and that's why we thought it was
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:24.260]   important for us to go through the book of Romans and we're not done yet there's
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.460]   so many things that we think about our faith that just have holes in it but
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:31.380]   we've never been challenged to think through these things right and maybe
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.060]   some of you guys are sitting here today and he said you know you've been living
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:37.700]   years thinking like as long as I hold on to this this particular statement of
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:42.500]   faith you know and not realizing that along with that comes all these other
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:49.420]   things but guess what all these other things if you really understand what
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:57.340]   they were is a path to freedom it is it's a path to freedom when you lose
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:03.780]   your life for the sake of Christ and you lose your competition for your
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:10.020]   reputation and you give up on this rat race and surrender your life to Christ
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:18.300]   then you can live you really can live think about how much of heartache and
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:26.940]   anxiety frustration merit of discord problems at work friendship raising
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:34.500]   children how much of that is produced because we are following the pattern of
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:42.460]   the God of this age Jesus says come to me if you want to be my disciples take
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:49.060]   up your cross deny yourself and follow me because that's the path to life would
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:53.860]   you take some time to pray with me as our team comes up again take a few
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:57.980]   minutes to come before the Lord and I think any prayer that's going to be
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.620]   sincere before you think about theological correctness and is it
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:07.060]   biblical be honest just like the psalmist when they were hurting they say
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:13.460]   God where are you why aren't you answering my prayers best prayer is the
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:18.100]   most honest prayer come before God wherever you are you know before you cry
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.140]   out to your friends before you cry out and seeking counselors come before God
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:27.180]   wherever you are I believe help my unbelief if you believe that answer is
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:31.460]   in Christ Christ is where we should be running to let's take some time to come
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:34.600]   for the Lord and seek him together.
