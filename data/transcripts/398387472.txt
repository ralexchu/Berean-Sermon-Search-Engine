[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580]   - All right, hello, church family, those of you guys tuning in from home, I pray that
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.820]   you're doing well.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.180]   And what a blessing it is to be able to, even like this, be able to study the scriptures
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.340]   together.
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.500]   And we do again ask that just efforts be made to have some type of interaction where you
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.660]   can discuss your findings and your observations about the passage, and also your personal
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.740]   reflections and applications as well so that you can mutually encourage each other.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.260]   So we're going to jump into our Bible study.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.800]   We do pray that you guys are following along in the study, and also in terms of announcements
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.180]   and updates that you guys are being informed through the website and our Facebook pages.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.700]   Now before we begin the study, I do want to make a quick shout out to our sound booth
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.700]   volunteer.
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.460]   I just want you to know you can't see him, but we are together alone in the massive sanctuary
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.100]   and this is going to be a blessed experience.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.820]   And as a benefit to him, I'm going to be preaching directly at him.
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.900]   All right, well, take a look at our passage in Ephesians chapter two, starting from verses
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.220]   19 through 22.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.680]   Before we get there, we always do have to look at the passage in context.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.140]   And so we want to review for a moment the things that happened already in chapter two.
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.140]   Remember that in chapter two, we were reminded in part one about the amazing truth of the
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.860]   gospel, that although previously we were absolutely dead in our transgressions and sins, that
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.820]   God made us alive together with Christ.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.700]   And this he was doing to show his surpassing riches of the grace and kindness towards us
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.600]   in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.840]   And then in the section immediately after part two of chapter two, verses 11 through
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:03.280]   22, we notice that he was revealing the relational reconciliation aspect of the gospel.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.560]   And so this in your packet is a blank for you there to jot in that God was showing
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.120]   within this passage, the relational reconciliation in which, although we were incredibly far,
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.720]   although we were separate, although essentially we were without hope and without a God in
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.240]   the world, through Christ he has brought us near.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.040]   And what an incredible privilege that is.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.600]   And as a matter of fact, that to us then is our greatest gain, that we have access relationally
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.640]   to God the Father.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.040]   Now one thing to highlight, this portion today, verse 19 through 22, is the ending portion
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.480]   of that long, long paragraph.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.400]   It was just one long paragraph that we split into because there was so much there.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.040]   And so with that said, we want to then go into looking at our passage.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.240]   Here I'll read it for us, starting from verse 19.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.600]   It says, "So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.040]   the saints and are of God's household, having been built on the foundation of the apostles
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.360]   and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.320]   fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.760]   together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit."
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.160]   Let's all take a moment to pray, to ask God to bless the study of his word.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.320]   Lord, we want to thank you, God.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.200]   Father, your truth, scripture says, is unshakable.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.320]   Though many things fade, especially we as humans, Lord, in generations we fade, God,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.360]   your scriptures last forever.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.440]   And we thank you, God, that you are giving to us your word, your precious word, and God,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.720]   that you are teaching us your incredible gospel.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.080]   We pray, Lord, with both appreciation, gratefulness in our hearts, we will continue to learn of
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   you.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.080]   Amen.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:17.440]   Now, taking a look, let's see, here, into the very first section, what I like to do
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.040]   is just go through the questions, the study questions that I had laid out, and one by
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.880]   one go through the questions and answer them, and that's how I'll review the passage for
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.000]   today.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.120]   Now, in question one, I asked this question, in verse 19 through 22, what is the relationship
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.520]   with this portion, with the previous section of scripture, as it's supposed to belong together,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.240]   in what way does it do that?
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.040]   Well, recall again, that if the section was saying that you were dead, and then you were
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.120]   made alive, and if in chapter two, we were being taught that we were far off, but now
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:02.240]   we're being brought together, here, in verse 19 through 22, we are being shown the ramifications
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.640]   of those gospel truths, that as Christ is working the gospel, meaning working out salvation,
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   this has then ramifications about what it means for us, what we become, who we are,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.440]   and that begins already in the previous section.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.560]   Here, if you notice the PowerPoint, I highlight for you the ramifications that the passage
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.960]   is already teaching us, that Christ, in doing so, in causing us to be reconciled, is making
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.400]   us one new man.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.320]   In Christ causing us to be reconciled and brought to God, he's bringing us in one body
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:47.440]   to God, and so already we see the ramifications of what Christ is doing in salvation, and
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.480]   so in our section today, we're looking here, and I'd like to highlight for you, as I
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.600]   read this section one more time, that you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household, and if you notice, I
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.520]   bolded the words at the beginning, so then, as a means to show you that kind of ramification,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.480]   and then what's more, the second half of this portion, starting from verse 20, it says,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.160]   "Having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.440]   being the cornerstone in whom the whole building being fitted together is growing into a holy
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:33.000]   temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.960]   Spirit," and therefore, we can say what salvation means for us then, is that we, as
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.160]   believers, are becoming these entities.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.360]   These are, yes, metaphorical pictures, but these have incredible ramifications for us,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.080]   and if you notice, after each metaphor, after each picture, I placed a little arrow, because
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.560]   those metaphors, those pictures then have ramifications even of their own, that this
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.080]   is what the church should be.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.440]   This is what every single person, every believer in the church should be trying to reflect,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.960]   that then we are actually emulating or fulfilling this picture that God has for us as a believer,
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.680]   as one body, one household, one temple, a dwelling place of God.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.160]   And so, as you think about this, primarily, in chapters one through three of the entire
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.120]   book of Ephesians, there is a movement.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.880]   There is a movement from personal salvation and the ramification of what that means for
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.960]   the church, the body.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.400]   And so, as a matter of fact, the book of Ephesians has incredible, incredible things to say,
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.440]   teachings, instructions of how we are to both conduct ourselves within the church, but more
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.800]   so who we are to be.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.720]   And so, I want to give a quick, brief challenge.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.120]   When we were supposed to be thinking about the blessings of God, let's not be so myopic
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.520]   to think just about how we are blessed as a person, but let's really think how we are
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.680]   blessed as a church, as a community of God, because there's so much for us within the
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.000]   context of what God is doing, not just for the one individual you, but for the collective
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.520]   church body.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.600]   Okay.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.520]   So then, that's how the two passages connect, verses 18, sorry, verses 11 through 18, and
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.080]   then today's passage, verse 19 through 22, we are seeing the ramifications of what that
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.080]   means for us as a collective church.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.440]   And then so, the next question is, what is the contrast between strangers and aliens
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.240]   versus the citizens with saints and household?
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.880]   Now, I apologize when I released the previous handout, I forgot to include the word household
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.800]   into this question, but we see the contrast there immediately, and if you look upon the
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.160]   PowerPoint, I highlight the contrast for you there.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.400]   He pits these two terms, strangers and aliens, against the ideas of citizenship and becoming
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.440]   one household together.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.240]   What is the contrast?
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.280]   We can just begin by saying this contrast is absolutely huge, right?
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.920]   And we talked about it a lot in the previous session, so I'm not going to necessarily be
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.680]   talking about it as much right now, but I'm going to just simply highlight what it really
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.080]   means to be citizen and households.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.180]   But by way of reminder, let's just recall that this contrast is so big.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:37.160]   To be strangers and aliens meant that we were, I guess the best way to put it is, foreigners
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.920]   who are illegal immigrants.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.800]   We're illegal, okay, aliens within this place, so to speak.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:49.560]   And so, if you take a moment to just think about that, to be a foreigner into any place
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.440]   where you're not supposed to be there, it is actually very, very scary.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.640]   It causes a sense of anxiety.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.360]   I mean, if you were to sneak into a theater, you know you have this anxiety like, "Oh,
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.320]   my gosh, I'm going to get caught and kicked out."
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.920]   You go into a gym and you're not a member, you can't use any other stuff.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:11.440]   If you are not an actual citizen, then you have no rights, you have no protection, you
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:19.700]   have no provisions, no opportunities, no right to labor, you have no stake in the kingdom.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.000]   And so, we think about the contrast, okay?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.040]   And the contrast is that actually he calls us citizens with the saints.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.120]   Take a moment to meditate and reflect on that.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.520]   If just a moment ago I said, "Think about all that it means to not be a citizen.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.720]   Think about all the things that it means to be a citizen.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.360]   But think about also what it means to be a citizen, not just of any old nation.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.160]   You're not becoming a citizen of a nice nation.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.720]   You're not becoming a citizen of even, let's say, a great nation like the US.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.960]   A powerful nation like the US.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:02.040]   But you are becoming a citizen of a kingdom with a powerful king.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:09.000]   You are becoming a citizen of a kingdom in which whose kingdom has no end.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.240]   The king whose power has no end, right?
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.720]   You have a king who has all good intentions in his heart for his people.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   Think about that.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:26.800]   I remember one time watching this military movie about 12 individuals who were in Iraq
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:33.040]   and they had to traverse with Iraqi soldiers in order to go into the depths of the nation,
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   right?
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.680]   And within that, of course, they hit many moments where it's dicey.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.960]   Many moments where it's dangerous and there's high risk.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.080]   And what's really interesting about it is one of the Iraqi soldiers turned to the American
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.520]   soldier and said, "You've got nothing to worry about.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.400]   You don't have to worry them and you don't have to worry us.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.520]   Because if you get hurt, your country comes after you."
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.180]   Now, think about that.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.440]   If you are a citizen, the country has your back.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.040]   And if you think then the privilege of becoming a citizen of God's kingdom, God's kingdom
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.600]   has then his protection, his provision, his banner over you.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.660]   This is an incredible, incredible privilege.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:25.720]   And so we want to be able to see that contrast, to appreciate prior to you had none of this,
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   but through Christ, now you are fellow citizens with the saints.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.220]   And you know what's more?
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.360]   I want us to turn to a passage in the book of Romans, Romans chapter nine.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.080]   Because it's a lengthy verse, I don't have it on the PowerPoint.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.000]   I would like you to turn there in your Bibles to take a look.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.840]   It's Romans chapter nine, verse 22 through 24.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.780]   We have to appreciate the contrast.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:57.260]   Prior to coming to faith, we were, you can think of it like this, second class citizens.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.660]   We were not citizens at all.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.340]   And so we weren't even, we have no privileges.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.380]   We have to think about that contrast.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:11.420]   Romans chapter nine, verse 22 says this, "What if God, although willing to demonstrate his
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:18.460]   wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience, vessels of wrath prepared
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.460]   for destruction?"
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.540]   Take a moment to think about this.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.660]   Vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, who are they?
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.480]   Does that include only the wicked nations of the past, the Babylonians and the Assyrians?
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.180]   Or does that actually include every nation so far?
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.460]   Does that include every Gentile, every ethnic?
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.880]   You bet you.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.980]   Verse 23, "And he did so to make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy,
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.300]   which he prepared beforehand for glory, even us, whom he also called, not from among the
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.900]   Jews only, but also from among the Gentiles."
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.180]   Do you see that?
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.380]   Now turn again in Romans chapter 11, verses 13 through 21.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.520]   Again, Romans 11, verse 13 through 21.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.380]   This passage continues on this thought, this amazing truth that God has not only called
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.700]   from the chosen nation of the Jews, but he's called then of those nations who were to be
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.460]   destroyed, who were subject to God's wrath.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.300]   Even from among them, God has chosen some to be vessels of his mercy.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.740]   Take a look at chapter 11, verse 13.
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.660]   Again, Romans 11, 13.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.060]   He says, "But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles."
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.420]   So listen up, because that includes all of us.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:42.060]   "Inasmuch as then I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:47.260]   If somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.700]   For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.700]   but life from the dead?
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.960]   If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.700]   If the root is holy, the branches are too.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.900]   But if some of the branches are broken off and you, being a wild olive, were grafted
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.980]   in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree, do not
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.700]   be arrogant toward the branches.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.580]   But if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who support the roots, but the
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.300]   root supports you.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.060]   You will say then, 'Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.'
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:30.380]   Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.940]   Do not be conceited but fear.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:39.140]   For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either."
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:45.700]   You have to appreciate the great contrast so that you would stay humble.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:51.500]   To believe and think, "Of course God would save us, He has to," right?
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.100]   Is to assume a lot.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.820]   To think that it has always been, it is now, and will for always be that God's immense
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.620]   love would just save all of us and so be it, we're just all the entire church from before
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.820]   and now, we're just one lump.
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.100]   No, no, no.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:13.100]   There is a clear contrast He wants you to understand before you had nothing.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.060]   And you have to feel that.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:21.340]   And only now in Christ you have everything as a citizen and you have to appreciate that.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.820]   And what's more, let's look at the concept of the household.
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.660]   The household.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:34.540]   To be called a citizen would be an immense, immense, rich, rich mercy for us.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.940]   That we would be called citizens of the kingdom of God.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:44.980]   But then, not only to be placed from an outside foreigner, to be brought into the kingdom,
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.420]   and then to be brought into the king's household.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.420]   Think about that.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.820]   That's almost unimaginable, right?
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.020]   But that's what the scripture says.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.700]   That we are brought into his household and that God considers us fellow heirs.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.740]   That we essentially are brothers, right?
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.460]   That Christ would bring many brothers into his household.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.100]   And so, scripture says, a passage I want to highlight for you is Galatians chapter 4,
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.340]   verses 4 through 9.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.540]   If you have a moment, take a moment to turn there in your Bibles.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.140]   Galatians chapter 4, verses 4 through 9.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.620]   "When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.260]   under the law, so that he might redeem those who are under the law, that we might receive
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.700]   the adoptions as sons.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:39.140]   Because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying,
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.140]   'Abba, Father!'
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.700]   Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.300]   However, at that time you did not know God.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.540]   You were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.820]   But now that you have come to know God, or rather be known by God, how is it that you
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:03.060]   turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things to which you desire to be
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.140]   enslaved all over again?"
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.180]   And that passage is just, asks you this rhetorical question.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:15.540]   It doesn't even make sense that you would even desire, even for a moment, to turn away
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.300]   from this.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:23.100]   Just to have the privilege to call God Almighty your Abba Father would be to you like going
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.980]   from absolute oppressive slavery to freedom.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.980]   How in the world would you turn back?
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.580]   And that's the whole question in Galatians chapter 4.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.820]   So the contrast.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.220]   I'm asking you, do you appreciate it?
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.300]   Do you understand what it means to go from absolute stranger and alien to then citizen
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:50.420]   of His amazing kingdom and then to be a member of His household?
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.740]   Now because today we're talking a lot about church, take a moment to ask this question.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:01.740]   Is it appropriate then for us to think about our church in this way, this metaphorical
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.540]   way, that we are a spiritual household?
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.420]   And the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.660]   Many portions of scripture, as a matter of fact, will say to those leaders of the church,
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.860]   teach the congregation how to conduct oneself in the household of God.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860]   And so think about this.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:24.860]   For many people, their citizenship into a nation, to them is both their refuge, their
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.300]   protection, their safety.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.660]   The church in many ways should that be for the believer.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:37.540]   And what's more, for a lot of people, their household, their household then is the cause
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.500]   of their sense of identity.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.380]   It's a sense of their belonging.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.900]   It's a sense of their mutual love.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.820]   Should the church be that for the believers?
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.580]   The answer is absolutely yes.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.980]   Now we're going to talk more and more about how the church should be, but that challenge
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.500]   there is for us there in the metaphor itself.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:04.220]   If God is conceiving us, depicting our salvation to lead to this, that by identity we would
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:09.020]   be then fellow citizens and also fellow members of the household, we have to think about the
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.980]   ramifications.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.620]   Now let's move forward to question number three.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.540]   What is the metaphor of the cornerstone trying to communicate?
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.400]   And so again, what is the metaphor of the cornerstone trying to communicate?
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.660]   And so in thinking about this, let's take a moment to look at the passage, okay?
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.660]   Take a moment to look at the passage where it says, "Having been built on the foundation
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:38.260]   of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone in whom the
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:43.700]   whole building being fitted together is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:49.060]   also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the spirit."
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.940]   Now what I'd like to do for you is highlight several key terms.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:59.660]   As we ask the question, what is this metaphor trying to communicate and teach us?
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.220]   I want to highlight for you something.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:08.060]   Notice how there are certain verbs that I circled, which is this household of God is
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.100]   depicted as being built.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:18.420]   This building of God is being fit together, and this temple of God is being built currently.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.460]   So right now, we have to get our mind into the mode of construction, into the build.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.700]   And what I'm talking about is many other portions of scripture tell us that God is
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:35.920]   building up within the church, his holy building, his holy temple, his holy household.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.900]   For example, 1 Peter 2, verse 5 says, "You also, as living stones, are being built up
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:47.980]   as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.600]   to God through Jesus Christ."
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.360]   So what's going on is there is construction going on.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.760]   There is a building project going on.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.260]   And just a few years ago, we were all part of it for our church building, right?
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.340]   And so many times throughout that process, you know what happened?
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.520]   There was all these inspections.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.720]   There was inspections as to the integrity of the structure.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.680]   We had to have structural engineers.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.320]   There was questions as to the integrity of the concrete foundation.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.040]   There was questions as to the integrity of every bolt.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.760]   There was questions as to the integrity of every strut and every beam in the roof.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:28.160]   I want you to think about that because then what it's talking about is that when there
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:34.040]   is a build going on, there is a question to the structural integrity.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.200]   How sound is this building?
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:44.160]   And when the passage says, "Christ himself is the cornerstone," you then have to understand
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.460]   there is a question about how is this being built?
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:55.000]   And the answer is we have a sound, unshakable, absolute, precious, and costly foundation
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.240]   that is sure, that is certain.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.640]   This building is amazing, essentially is what we're saying.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:09.760]   If Christ is a sure foundation, then we have a strong foundation that will last, unshakable.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.360]   Basically, the way I want to put it is like this.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.920]   Typically, when anybody builds a building, they start going through the cost, right?
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.080]   Even, you know, Jesus, when he did in parables, like, nobody begins a building project and
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.140]   not count the cost.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.320]   You always check your budget.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.440]   And then the thing about it is in an ideal world, you would have just an endless budget,
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.920]   but we don't.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.400]   But I want you to take a moment just to think about what I just said.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.120]   What an amazing fantasy it would be, right?
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.880]   What an amazing fantasy it would be if the next time you were thinking about your home
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.480]   remodeling, if the next time we were thinking about our church building, that there was
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   no cost spared.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480]   Why?
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.060]   Because we had an endless budget.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:24:00.900]   We used all of the highest, not just good stuff, not just medium stuff, not just safe
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:05.640]   stuff, but we used all the highest, most quality material to build.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:11.300]   And when the inspection came, it was like, "Wow, you spared no expense for this."
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.140]   I want to highlight for you an interesting passage.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.300]   Isaiah chapter 28, verse 16.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:22.360]   The scripture says, "Therefore thus says the Lord God, 'Behold, I am laying in Zion
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:29.480]   a stone, a tested stone, a costly cornerstone for the foundation, firmly placed.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:35.380]   He who believes in it will not be disturbed.'"
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.380]   Think about that.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.880]   I mean, just think about any kind of structure.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.920]   You put the walls in, you put the foundation in, and then you put its load, you put its
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:49.520]   weight on there, and it doesn't creak, crack, or it doesn't even move.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.640]   Christ has said he's going to establish his church.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.080]   And Christ, he is the one who created this world.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.880]   And you will notice, as Apostle Paul talks about the beauties of the church, all of a
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.200]   sudden, randomly, just randomly within the context of the passage, he'll say, "Who created
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.360]   everything?"
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.000]   Think about that.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.240]   This Lord of all is establishing his church.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:18.640]   And so figuratively, Christ being the chief cornerstone is everything to the church.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:25.840]   He is the chief cornerstone who sets the parameters, who sets the weight, who sets the direction.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.960]   Everything is set upon Christ, the firm foundation.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.880]   And he is the precious, costly stone.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.400]   And earlier, what I said is the church is going to be tested.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.280]   There is going to be a weight.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.580]   There is going to be a stress test.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.700]   And I want to turn to an interesting passage where Apostle Paul describes this.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:54.640]   He says in 1 Corinthians 3, verse 9, 1 Corinthians 3, verse 9, "For we are God's fellow workers,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.940]   and you are God's field, God's building.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.380]   According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder, I laid
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.540]   a foundation, and another is building on it.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.160]   But each man must be careful how he builds on it.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:14.220]   For no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:20.540]   Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:26.220]   straw, each man's work will become evident, for the day will show it, because it is to
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.520]   be revealed with fire.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.420]   And the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.920]   If any man's work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.700]   If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.900]   as through fire.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:50.460]   Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.020]   If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.860]   holy, and that is what you are."
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.620]   Wow, what a powerful passage.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.540]   Let that resonate with you.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:11.620]   There is so much good teaching here of how the churches should be built.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:16.500]   As a matter of fact, I mean, sometimes people ask us like, "What's your model of discipleship?
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.940]   What's your model of church building?
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.940]   What's your philosophy of ministry?"
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.940]   Now in some sense it's difficult because seasons change, our congregation may look different,
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.940]   right?
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.860]   We have different struggles through different stages of our growth.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:36.020]   But there's a sense in which church philosophy is easy because it's already set for us in
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.820]   Scripture.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:43.580]   You guys know so many times in church history and now, even for our leadership, people have
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.780]   all sorts of opinions and ideas about how church should be done.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:53.060]   I mean, there are so many ideas and criticisms, and then sometimes there are not only criticisms,
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.260]   but there's praise.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.440]   Sometimes there are all sorts of things that come out of our way that kind of pressure
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.660]   us on one side or another to do something about the church, to grow it in a certain
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.660]   way.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.780]   There have been people who want to essentially try guinea pig with the church.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:14.300]   The church has become sometimes a lab rat for people who like building stuff, entrepreneurs,
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.340]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.820]   It's going to get burned.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.900]   It'll be tested.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.940]   And we're not about that.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.780]   Sometimes people want us to try different business models.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.220]   And there has even been a movement in recent church history called the Emergent Movement,
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.340]   which was essentially to say, "Let's redefine church."
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:40.180]   There is a meta-narrative, and that narrative is ever-developing, they would say.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:46.260]   That the church story is ongoing, and therefore, it must be developing and changing.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.420]   And to that, we just say, "No, that's not what the Scripture says."
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.420]   No.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.820]   We don't get to just say there's this big, grand story that we think is going to be developing
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.220]   about the church.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:07.540]   Our Lord, God, Christ our Savior, He is once and for all delivered up for us.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:12.940]   And He has become already the chief cornerstone that has already set the trajectory of the
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.940]   church.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:19.760]   And by Him, He is going to determine whether this has been built correctly or not.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.300]   The book has been already written.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:26.140]   He's going to come, and He who holds the seven stars in His hand is going to judge every
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:33.980]   church for the content of its build, for the quality of its foundation, for the fruit of
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.580]   what it's been investing in.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:41.300]   And so for us, we have to have all that in mind when we think about Christ being the
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.260]   chief cornerstone of our church.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.360]   It must be that Christ is the sure foundation.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:57.740]   And so I ask you, if for you, what you hope that the church would become, like what you
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:03.380]   think of the church when you think, "Oh, this is a really good church."
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.540]   If it doesn't have the character of Christ in it, if it doesn't have the structure, if
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.740]   it doesn't have the foundation, and if it doesn't have the purpose of Christ in that
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.980]   picture, you have to radically redefine what's happening here.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.560]   We radically define our interpretations.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:24.260]   Lastly, let's move on to question number four.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.880]   What else does this passage teach us about the church?
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.720]   We're asking the question a lot about what does this passage really teach us about the
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   church?
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.740]   Well, let me give you some things here.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.500]   As we take a look at the passage again, I'll read it for us, and it says, "In whom the
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:46.580]   whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:53.020]   whom you also are being built together into dwelling of God in the Spirit."
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:58.220]   Now again, I think it's pretty amazing that Apostle Paul, without specifically using the
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:04.520]   term church, he's given now such a vivid, a vibrant picture of what the church should
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.020]   be.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:11.300]   But amongst this picture, obviously we see that he is emphasizing and repeating the idea
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.660]   that the church should be the temple, the holy temple, which is a dwelling place of
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.820]   God in the Spirit.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.160]   So take a moment to reflect upon that.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.260]   It's not just us.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.260]   God is working.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:33.820]   God is active to cause us as a church, a Berean community church, to be holy for himself.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:40.540]   And he desires that his very presence should all the more be evident within our church,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.540]   right?
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:47.020]   So the church should truly be a place where the presence of God is more transparent because
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:53.140]   we are actively exercising our faith, because we as Christians are emulating and mimicking
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.540]   his character of holiness, because we as Christians are mimicking and emulating his love, his
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:05.380]   great patience, all the stuff that we do in faith, in likeness of our God, should make
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.260]   the character of our God more transparent.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.020]   We should see it.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.300]   That's my point.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.040]   We should see it.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.380]   And so the church is being built up.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.820]   And what's more, I want to highlight this point, that the church is in the process of
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.500]   being built up, right?
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:31.980]   The church is in the process of emulating, is radically changing, it's being transformed,
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:36.780]   all the weak joints are being strengthened, and that's what I want to highlight for you.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   And so I'd like to say again, when we think about the church, and perhaps in the process
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.920]   of the build, we get frustrated, right?
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.380]   We get very frustrated because it's like, "Ugh, it's just not what I think it should
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.780]   be," you know?
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.660]   Do we have that thought that's rolling in our heads, and that's the context.
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:00.140]   God is working to cause us to be holy, reflecting his character, but this is a process of the
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.460]   build where he's fitting many pieces together.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:10.100]   And if we've never been a part of any kind of process that takes many years, a long time,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.340]   it takes time where sometimes we think people should be here, people should be there, people
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.860]   should be in certain maturity, and sometimes that maturity doesn't happen, are we going
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.380]   to be frustrated and say, "Ugh, forget this then"?
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.340]   Are we going to say, "Scrap this then"?
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.220]   Maybe the plan is wrong, maybe God had a silly idea.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.320]   No, no, no, we don't get to say that.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:37.780]   But in humility, our interpretations have to know that God is building this church.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.060]   And in as much as it might not seem like it's working, it might not seem to be going as
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:49.060]   fast or developing like the way that we want it to be, we have to humbly invest ourselves
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.980]   into this build.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:56.140]   And so let me ask you, was there ever a time where you just fed up with the church?
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.560]   Was there ever a time where you just disappointed, just flat out disappointed?
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.180]   Was there ever a time where you critiqued the church?
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.500]   And on the flip side, was there ever a time where you just said, "You know what, this
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.140]   is fine, I don't want it to change.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.660]   As a matter of fact, I like it the way it is, let's not change anything"?
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.060]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:18.700]   On both sides of the spectrum, whether you want the church to radically change because
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.500]   you're just fed up with it, or you want the church to stay the same because you don't
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:29.620]   want it to move, or you don't want to adapt to the changes, we recognize the church is
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.340]   in the build according to the plan of God.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.200]   And so finally, I want to just give you some takeaway thoughts.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:43.100]   From today's passage, we recognize, wow, the church is vitally important in the current
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.040]   program of God.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.020]   That should be an immense takeaway from you.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:53.660]   If God is saying that the church carries with it the significance of citizenship in a kingdom,
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.660]   that's huge.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:35:01.420]   I mean, you have no idea how important citizenship really means.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.540]   There are people literally lined up for years.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:09.100]   There are people who have signed up for US naturalization, it took them 12 years.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.660]   In certain countries, I just did a little bit of research, there's a country called
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.660]   Qatar.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:18.100]   There's an individual who's been waiting 30 years to become a citizen of that country.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:23.060]   And as a matter of fact, pretty much, unless both your parents are citizens of that country,
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.660]   your chances are slim to none.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:31.500]   I mean, if God is putting into the church such a value because He sees it that way,
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:36.420]   because He wants it to be this, that He's putting the value of His household.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:42.740]   Think about how vitally important the church should be in our attitude, in our perspective.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.420]   And so what's more, when we think about the church and its program, it is so, so important.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.300]   But I want to give you this encouragement.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.100]   It's not just to be like, "Okay, let's hold it up here."
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.280]   The church is precious, but be encouraged.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.980]   As each and every one of you, we learn to use our gifting personality and everything
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.700]   we have to the glory of God.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.780]   Why?
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:11.660]   Because by you doing that within the church, God wants to reveal aspects of His own character.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.420]   God wants to make more manifest His very presence.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:21.700]   You playing your role as the arm, as the feet, as the nose, whatever it may be.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.460]   You applying your faith.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:30.340]   You exercising greater self-discipline, your desire to grow in holiness and righteousness.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:37.540]   Do you understand that God is using every piece of that to make sure He is more evident,
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.900]   especially within our fold?
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:45.260]   And especially in this session, I mean, just recently, I hope that you guys saw Pastor
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:53.100]   Peter's post of how because we're not able to meet right now in person, in many ways,
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:58.660]   it causes us to even appreciate and long for fellowship all the more.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.580]   And I know every single one of you can resonate with that.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.780]   And especially during now, when I see people volunteering in the midst of when it's difficult
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.740]   to volunteer, in the midst when we have to weigh the options of do we do this and do
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:15.500]   we not, I'm so much so just thankful.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:21.060]   Because we're not able to meet right now and because we're not able to physically be together,
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.460]   it's all the more long, there's all the more longing.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:29.060]   And I hope that even especially given this passage, when we think about the value that
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:34.980]   God places into the church, then we all the more say, "Yes, Lord, we hope to be a part
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.660]   of this great build that you are doing."
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.300]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.420]   Heavenly Father, we do thank you, God.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:53.140]   We recognize, Lord, that every angle, every need that we have, you have thoroughly blessed
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.140]   us.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:38:01.980]   Through the study of Ephesians, you have already tended to the greatest need that we have,
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.500]   which was, Father God, we had no life without you.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.820]   We were dead, Lord, and so far.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.420]   God, you have already met those needs.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:16.660]   And as our Heavenly Father, you also meet the needs, Father God, that we have.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:21.340]   And what's more, as our good God, you use us in your kingdom.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:25.100]   And what's more, Father, you use us for your glory.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.300]   And for all of that, Lord, we thank you.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:34.100]   I pray, then, that God, as we study, we would learn to appreciate and then buy into what
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.820]   you are doing.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.420]   Help us not to resist.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.660]   Help us not to have our own agendas.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.060]   Help us, Father God, not to have our own depiction of what we would like this thing to be.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:49.320]   But God, help us to realize, Lord, you are piecing us together, and you're building
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.620]   us up in Christ.
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.740]   That, God, we would be a holy temple, a pleasing dwelling place for you.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.740]   We thank you, God.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.460]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
