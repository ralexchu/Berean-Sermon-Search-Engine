[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   >> Good evening, everybody.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   We're grateful that you can join in with us for a time of worship and devotion.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Right now is a time when a lot of us are staying on top of the news and
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   trying our best to stay informed, which we should be.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   But one thing that could happen is at the forefront of our minds,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   we could have simply current affairs at the top of the list.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   But during this time of Easter, we want to make sure that we are intentionally and
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   actively trying to have our minds really focused on Christ, that his salvation work,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   that all the things that he accomplished is at the forefront of our thoughts.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And also, what is causing us the greatest wonder and amazement and appreciation.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   As we begin this time, would you please take a moment to pray with me?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Our God, we thank you so much.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Lord, in every season, we thank you.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   But particularly now, as the world currently, Father, is at unrest,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   there are many worries, legitimately so.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   But during this time, Father God, we want to make sure that our faith is active.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   God, that we are considering you, that we are very aware of your presence.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And Lord, what we desire to do this week is to make sure that we are remembering
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   the work of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   God, that we are remembering all that you have done, all the sacrifice,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   all the suffering, and all the things that you had to lay down,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   so that God, you would save our souls eternally.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And so for that, God, we want to devote to you our time, our thoughts, and our praise.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   We'll begin with time of worship.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   [music]
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has ever conceived
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   the glorious things you have prepared for everyone who has believed.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   You brought us near and you called us your own, made us join heirs with your Son.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   How high and how low, deep and how long, how sweet and how strong is your love.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   How lavish your grace, how faithful your ways, how great is your love, oh Lord.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   [music]
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Objects of mercy should have known wrath were filled with unspeakable joy.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Riches of wisdom, unsearchable wealth, the wonder of knowing your love.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   You are our treasure and our great reward, hope and our glorious King.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   How high and how low, deep and how long, how sweet and how strong is your love.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   How lavish your grace, how faithful your ways, how great is your love, oh Lord.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   How high and how low, deep and how long, how sweet and how strong is your love.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   How lavish your grace, how faithful your ways, how great is your love, oh Lord.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   How great is your love, oh Lord.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   [music]
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   [music]
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Come behold the wondrous mystery in the dawning of the King.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   He the theme of heaven's praises, robed in frail humanity.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   In our longing, in our darkness, now the Lamb of Christ has come.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Look to Christ who condescended, took all flesh to ransom us.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   [music]
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Come behold the wondrous mystery. He the perfect Son of Man.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   In His living, in His suffering, never trace nor stain of sin.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   See the true and better Adam come to save.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   The hell-bound man, Christ the great and sure fulfillment of the law in Him we stand.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   [music]
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Come behold the wondrous mystery. Christ the Lord upon the tree.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   In the stead of ruined sins, He brings the Lamb in victory.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   See the price of our redemption. See the Father's plan unfold.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Bringing many sons to glory, grace of measure, love untold.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   [music]
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Come behold the wondrous mystery. Slain by death, the God of life.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But no grave could ever restrain Him. Praise the Lord, He is alive.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   The foretaste of deliverance, how unworthy.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Bring our hope, Christ in power resurrected, as we will be when He comes.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   [music]
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Okay, well we're glad you could make it out to listen and praise with us,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   to walk down what our Savior went through on His last week here on earth
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   before He resurrected. And so to think about the gospel accounts,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   it's a little bit difficult because initially you might think the gospel accounts are chronological.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   They are not. And so what we're going to be doing this week as we go through the Passion Week
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   is to filter through and see what Christ did on each day.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   So tonight being Monday, we'll see what Christ did on the Monday after Palm Sunday.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   The most important thing to remember is this, is what Christ did on the cross,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   is the resurrection that subsequently came after. In 1 Corinthians chapter 15,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   verses 3 through 4, it says, "For I delivered to you as of first importance
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   So yesterday, hopefully you're with us on Palm Sunday, as Jesus arrived in Jerusalem.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   We heard all about it, the crowd that was praising Hosanna, Hosanna to Jesus the King.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And they didn't realize that He came to do so much more than save them and rescue them
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   from a foreign oppression. He came to save them from their sin.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And just as we saw yesterday, Jesus was weeping as the crowd was cheering.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Now that Sunday evening, Jesus, He traveled to Bethany, to the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   to spend the night. Bethany was a small village at the foot of the Mount of Olives,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   a short distance east of Jerusalem. After a night of rest in Bethany,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Jesus headed back towards Jerusalem, and on His way He grew hungry.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   He sees this fig tree, and He goes to it. Upon approaching it, it says here in Matthew 21, verse 18,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   "Now in the morning when He was returning to the city, He became hungry.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And He said to it, 'No longer shall there be any fruit from you.'
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And at once the fig tree withered." It's an odd picture that Jesus would come across a tree without fruit
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   and use His power to curse this tree and kill the tree, essentially, which we see Him explain the very next day.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   However, it isn't what it seems. Next, what happens is that Jesus, as He explains this tree and the cursing of it,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   the significance of the condemnation that He has on this tree is to symbolize Israel.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   He was trying to make a point. Israel was often referred to as a fig tree,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   and three different prophets amongst many spoke of Israel and her leaders being fruitless.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   It says in Jeremiah, chapter 8, verse 13, "I will surely snatch them away.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   There will be no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig tree.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And the leaf will wither, and what I have given them will pass away."
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   In Hosea, chapter 9, verse 10, it says, "I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   But they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and they became as detestable as that which they loved."
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And then another prophet, Joel, in chapter 1, verse 7, says,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   "It has made my vine a waste, and my fig tree splinters.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   It has stripped them bare and cast them away. Their branches have become white."
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   The running theme here is that Israel, many times mentioned as a fig tree,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   would be fruitless as a result of idolatry and a pursuit of false gods,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   with their religion becoming a shell of what it was meant to be,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   and without purpose and meaning, ultimately pursuing their own selfish desires,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   with God becoming a means as to that pursuit.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Israel was God's chosen people, and yet as a nation, they didn't display the fruit of that reality.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   They claimed to be in a covenant relationship with the Lord.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   They claimed that they were chosen people, a people for His own possession,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   a people that belonged to Him, and yet, just like the tree, there was no fruit.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Again, they were a shell. They held the outline of what Israel ought to be.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Though they looked the part of being a fig tree, they did not produce any figs.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   What is a fig tree when it doesn't bear figs?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   It's only good to be chopped down and disposed of.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   You see, God's people are marked by fruit.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   But if God's people do not produce fruit, Jesus talks about it later on in John 15, verse 6.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   He says, "He is thrown away as a branch, and dries up, and they gather them,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   and cast them into the fire, and they are burned."
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   This is because if God's people are not bearing fruit, it's indicative that they do not truly abide in the Lord.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   John 15, verse 5 says, "I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   He who abides in me and I in him, he bears much fruit."
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   So no fruit means that there is no abiding in the Lord.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   There is no root in the giver of life.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   It's a dead branch, only good to be cast, thrown away, dried up,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   ultimately to be used as firewood, burnt until there's nothing left.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   This is not a directive for us to produce fruit.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   You can't do it yourself.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   You can't wring your own hands and force fruit to be displayed in your life.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And we see the reality of this playing out as he proceeds to walk into Jerusalem and into the temple courts,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   which is what happens next.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Jesus walks into this temple.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And where the cursing of the fruitless fig tree was a symbolic gesture,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   we see the real world example of what Jesus is talking about
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   in full display on this Monday afternoon.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   In Matthew chapter 21 verse 12, it says,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And he said to them, 'It is written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   but you are making it a robber's den."'"
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Now what does Jesus see here?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   The money lenders and sellers were bartering and cheating those who would make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   from wherever they lived for the Passover, which was to happen on the Thursday.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   The law stated that during the Passover, a sacrifice must be offered up to the Lord.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   But don't view the pilgrims as victims.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   They knew how to barter with the sellers as well.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   They knew what they were doing.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   They were manipulating.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   They were counting their coins.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   They were self-centered, and they were greedy as well.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   They were probably trying to figure out the best way to pay the least bit of money to offer up to the Lord for Passover.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   And for many of them, this was not so much an offering of worship.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   This was rote religion.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Some habitual action.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Some religious thing that someone might do, no better than the Roman Catholics,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   who practiced their Hail Marys and Rosaries to try to, with lifeless action, achieve God's favor.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   It was not a love for the Lord thou seen there.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   There was no worshipful attitude or heart.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   They were reluctantly doing what they were told they must do,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   that they must go to the temple during the Passover and give this sacrifice.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   There were three major times during the year, Pentecost, the Feast of Booths, and the Passover,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   in which they were called to make this pilgrimage to the temple.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Now, we have to take a moment to remember what the Passover was.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   We're going to be talking about that in depth on Thursday.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   But just for a moment, we remember that the Passover was during the time of Egypt, after the 10th plague,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   that God had an angel of death pass over the people who would put blood of the Lamb over their posts.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   And this was all to point to the coming Messiah, who would save the lives of his people
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   by taking the wrath of God upon himself, like the Lamb, taking death so that we might live.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   That picture, the Passover, was Jesus coming down into the world,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   a culmination of thousands of years of waiting,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   thousands of years of God meticulously planning out in order to display how he would unfurl his redemptive plan.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   From Genesis 3, from the beginning of time even, when God told Adam and Eve
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   that one day a seed would come from the woman and crush the head of the serpent,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   that Jesus was coming to fulfill all of this.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   That during the time of the flood, Babel, Abraham, Joseph,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   through the time of Joshua and the judges, the kings, the split kingdoms,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   all the conquest of the four nations with Assyria and Babylon and Persia, with Greece and Rome,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   all of Israelite history, waiting, waiting, waiting, and Jesus had finally come.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Here he was, walking down this last week of life towards the cross,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   deliberately marching to atone for the sins of his people,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   to finally and ultimately crush the head of the serpent,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   to take away the sting of death, and to bring his people into the household of the Almighty God,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   and to usher in a new kingdom that can never be taken away.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And here Jesus saw in the last week of his life,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   the Jews bartering, cheating, swindling, conniving, and scheming on each other,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   in the temple of the Lord where true worship was supposed to be.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   The temple where sins were atoned for.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   This temple of God was as close to the physical presence of God that you could get.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And during the Old Testament time, the temple of God was where God had created a sign
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and a symbol of this coming Messiah that would save the world,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   where the Father would sacrifice his very own Son, the fallen man.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Jesus knew what he was doing this last week of his life,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   and on this Monday he enters into his temple.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   The day after, many people are praising, "Hosanna, Hosanna to the Messiah."
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   In Jeremiah chapter 7 verse 11 it says,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   "Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your sight?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Behold, I, even I, have seen it," declares the Lord.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   See, God foresaw this.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And this is why Jesus was so angry in this temple.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   The temple was a place for this sacrifice.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   This whole building, this whole temple building was a place for God to provide the reconciliation
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   between him and his people.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   For the Passover, such a beautiful image and picture of the redemptive plan of God.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And these Jews were bartering and trying to make a profit.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Greedy, selfish, robbing, hateful, glory hogs,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   desiring to use gains for their personal security and pleasures of the world.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   What they were doing isn't misplaced worship.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   They're not just doing something a little bit wrong here.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   This was sacrilege.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   This was a stamping and a spitting, a mocking of God.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   This was rebellion at its highest.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   That the people of God, during the time of great importance to God,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   the Passover, in the holy city of God, in the holy temple of God,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   with the sacrifices that were meant to save people from certain death,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   they were acting like this.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   This was not misplaced worship.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   This is satanic, and this is sin at its height.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   This whole picture was to show that humanity,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   humanity who's wholly at the mercy of a furious God,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   they were not just profiting,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   but this whole system was built around this thought that they could purchase forgiveness.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Jesus knew that he alone could purchase forgiveness, and here they were.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And these Jews, they were doing it all in the name of God.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   The fig tree imagery begins to make some sense.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   These were Jews.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   These were the scant remnant, the people of Israel,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   ravaged due to their perversions and idolatry,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   diluted in their bloodline, far from their previous faithfulness.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And any kind of faithfulness that did exist was now a shadow,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   an ugly outline, a shell of religious works, brought by human hands,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   going through the motions of traveling to Jerusalem, traveling to this temple,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   buying a sacrifice for the Passover.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And again, here was the one true sacrifice,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   the one in which all things would be fulfilled.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   All of Israelite history realized every shadow and symbol completed and perfected in Jesus,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   the culmination of all the redemptive plan and actions of God,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   standing at the foot of this temple,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   a mockery against God.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   It would have been better for them not to give sacrifice at all.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   It would have been better not to have traveled to Jerusalem at all
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   than to do what they were doing in this temple.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   In Psalm 51, verse 16, it says,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   "For you do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   You are not pleased with burnt offering."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   And in Isaiah 1, verse 11, God says to his people,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   "What are your multiplied sacrifices to me?" says the Lord.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed cattle,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats."
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And so Jesus, he overturned the tables
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and chased everyone out of his holy temple with the whip.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   His holiness seen, God's holiness seen,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   that God's wrath would be brought upon the people,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   that Jesus would continue through this week
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   with this just being the first step.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   We see the sinners that he came to die for here in this picture.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And in every step this week, every picture and every story,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   every narrative, every historical thing that happens during this Passion Week,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   we'll see that Jesus has his face set towards the end.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Just like we learned yesterday during the Palm Sunday,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   that he was deliberate in his actions,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   marching towards the end, this cross where he would meet the wrath of God head on for his people.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Let me pray for us.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Heavenly Father, thank you so much
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   that even in these stories,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   even as we see and we think about what Jesus did in his last week of life,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   we can see such depth as to your deliberate and purposeful, intentional actions.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   That Jesus, every day of his life, not just Passion Week,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   every day of his life lived intentionally marching towards that cross.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And so Father, as we think about the last week,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   as we look through the eyes of our Savior,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and as we see from the perspective of you, our God,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I pray Lord that we would not be thinking about just the physical pain that happened.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   But our theology would broaden during this time.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   That what you did on that cross,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   and what you did in every event leading up to that cross,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   oh God, it was so, so beautiful.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Father, thank you that as even as Jesus is angry here in this temple,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   God for the joy set before him,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   he marched towards that cross.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   As he set his eyes upon your glory,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and a love for the people that he would come to save.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Father, would you cause our hearts to worship greater and greater as the days go by.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Until we go to Christ at the cross,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   and then our resurrected Christ on Sunday.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Thank you Lord, and it's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   [Music]
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Lord of every age
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Lord of every age
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Author of the faith
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   First, the last, the same
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Name above all names
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Crowned in majesty
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Glorious Prince of Peace
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   We're on that guy's right hand
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   A world that is command
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   A world that is command
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Jesus, Lamb of God
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   How great you are
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   There is no other Savior
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Every knee bows down
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   At your renown
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   There is no other Savior
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   [Music]
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Merciful High Priest
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Lover of the least
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Generous and mean
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Protector of the weak
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Sacrifice to death
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   For us your final breath
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Time the world to save
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   To overcome the grave
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   To overcome the grave
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Jesus, Lamb of God
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   How great you are
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   There is no other Savior
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Every knee bows down
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   At your renown
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   There is no other Savior
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   You will reign forever
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   You will reign forever
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   You will reign forever
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   You will reign forever
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   You will reign forever
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   You will reign forever
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Jesus, Lamb of God
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   How great you are
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   There is no other Savior
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Every knee bows down
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   At your renown
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   There is no other Savior
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   [Music]
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Amen, let's pray.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Our God, we want to thank you.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   There is no other Savior like you.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And Father God, there is no other God like you.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   As we think about this week and appreciate
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   the unfolding of your plan,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   we want to appreciate your love for us.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Not just simply in general,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   not in superficiality.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Father God, as you have orchestrated
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   your salvation plan, we want to appreciate the depth of it.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   And as scripture calls us to know and understand
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   truly what is the depth,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   to hide in the breath of Christ's love,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   I pray in this way that we would have in our minds
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and reflect upon all the different steps that Christ took,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   all the different surroundings,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   not just so that we would know history,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   but Father God, we would know the work of our Lord.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   We thank you, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   We'll see you here tomorrow, everybody.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Good night.
