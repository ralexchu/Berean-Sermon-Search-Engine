[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   So we're going to be looking at this morning is John chapter 8.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.600]   We're going to be going through parts of chapter 7 and chapter 8.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.420]   So I encourage you to keep your Bibles open to those texts.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.720]   But this morning I'm going to be reading from chapter 8 verse 12 before we get started.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.160]   Then Jesus again spoke to them saying, I am the light of the world.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.920]   He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.160]   Let's pray.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.640]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would ordain these words.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.000]   May it go forth and not return until it has accomplished the purpose that you have ordained.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.680]   We ask Lord God that you give us soft hearts, open ears, a willing spirit, Lord God, to
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.960]   listen and to obey.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.320]   Open our eyes, Lord, that we may understand and a desire to continue to seek you, Father
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.400]   God, longing to hear from you and only you.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.880]   We pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.040]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:16.440]   All right, so now it's already been five weeks and we're hoping that at the end of maybe
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.520]   a week or two that we'll get some news from the government and that social distancing
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.360]   and all that stuff will probably be in place, but maybe the shutdown will begin to ease.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.560]   And I know many of you who are still working and not able to enjoy a lot of the things
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.440]   that we had before, that we're looking to go back to our normal life.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.040]   And as I mentioned at the beginning of this, I think it's a good opportunity for us to
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.360]   reflect what is normal life?
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.800]   What are the things that we miss that if it does open back up, what will we do?
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.340]   Maybe hang out with our friends, go to a restaurant, maybe get back to certain things that we enjoy
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.640]   doing in larger numbers, come back to church.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   What is normal?
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.760]   In fact, you know, this is the exact thing that Jesus was trying to address with these
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.920]   I am statements.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.400]   When Jesus said the seven I am statements, the emphasis on the I am statements is not
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.000]   that he is the bread of life or he's the light of the world, he's the resurrection and the
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   life.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.360]   It really is the I am statement, because it is the I am statement that connects him to
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.920]   the I am God of Yahweh of the Old Testament.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.200]   So if we read this like any other sentence, it was I am this and I am that, we missed
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.520]   the whole point of this, because as I said in the beginning of this, in the Greek composition
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:51.120]   of this word I am, it is the two to be statements back to back that connects this to the I am
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.280]   statement of God when he introduces himself to Moses and he says I am.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.120]   So the Jews clearly understood when Jesus was saying this that he was saying that he
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.240]   is connected to or he is God himself.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.800]   But what's different about the I am statements in the New Testament is that Jesus was actually
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.080]   teaching the I am application to our lives.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.280]   So every one of these I am statements is trying to correct what became normal to the Jewish
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.920]   community.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.400]   Much of it was a misunderstanding of who the Messiah was.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.120]   They were expecting Jesus or the Messiah to come and he was going to feed them, take care
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.520]   of them, he was going to lead them, and each one of these I am statements are stated in
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.280]   a particular historical context.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.840]   He didn't have a curriculum of seven I am statements and decided that this is something
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.300]   that he needs to teach, you know, the seminary students so they can have this knowledge.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.400]   Each one of these I am statements are given in a specific context that they had a misunderstanding
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.480]   or expectation of what they thought the Messiah was going to be and Jesus was correcting them,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.120]   a correct understanding of the I am is that he is the bread of life, that he is the light,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.820]   he is the door, he is the shepherd.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.360]   And so if you remember, we've gone through two I am statements already.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.760]   We have the I am the bread of life and the context in which he says that is after he
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.800]   feeds the 5,000 and they're looking for more bread and Jesus says I am the bread of life.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.960]   Last week we talked about in the resurrection, Jesus says I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.200]   He says that in the context of raising Lazarus because they wanted him to live.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.240]   And so in that context he says no, it is not just because he has breath, he says I am the
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.560]   resurrection and the life.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.080]   So today's statement, I mean we've already gone through two, this is actually the third,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.660]   but out of the seven, this is the second, out of the seven statements where he says
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.040]   I am the light of the world.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.000]   It is also within a specific historical context.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.640]   He wasn't just saying this out of the blue into the air.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.520]   If you look at chapter seven, again I'm not going to turn there, but if you look at chapter
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:12.080]   seven, he says this in the context at the end of one of the Jewish's seven major feasts.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.120]   In fact it happens to happen at the very end of their calendar.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.000]   The beginning of their calendar starts with the Passover and then the seventh and the
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.080]   last of the festivals was called the feast of booths.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.400]   Some of your translations may have feasts of tabernacles and it was the same.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.240]   They consider this probably the biggest of their ceremonies.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.680]   And we would naturally think that it may have been the Passover, you know.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.360]   But the Jews celebrated this in a big way because it was connected to two specific things
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.640]   that was going on.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.160]   One, it was the celebration at the end of the harvest.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.200]   So you can kind of think of it as their Thanksgiving.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.440]   But after the harvest they would collect all the fruits and all the bounty that they had
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.960]   from the harvest and they would take that and then all throughout the week they would
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.800]   have these big festivals.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.400]   They would have families gather together and have these huge festivals.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.440]   And so it was like a Thanksgiving and this lasted for about eight days.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.680]   And during these eight days, one of the things that they did was they would set out a temporary
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   booth.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.400]   And what we would consider like a tent.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.600]   And the reason why they did that was to remember God's deliverance of Israel and how God led
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.320]   them through the desert for 40 years.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.960]   So if you remember the Passover was to celebrate how God protected them over the angel of death
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.660]   and led them out of Israel, or led them out of Egypt.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.800]   The Feast of Booth was a celebration of how God led them in the desert for 40 years and
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.120]   protected them.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.720]   So they would live in tents for those eight days, having these large festivals, enjoying
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.960]   the bounty of their harvest.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.640]   And at the end of the eighth day, again, they would have a ceremony to remember that God
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.920]   is the one who delivered them.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.280]   So Jesus is saying, I am the light of the world in the context of them celebrating the
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   Feast of Booth.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.880]   And the reason why this is so significant is because one of the main things, main things
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:20.800]   that they did in this ceremony was that they set up at the temple a 75 foot, like a lamp,
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.200]   four of them.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.800]   And so the priest would climb this up and light this and it would be going for seven,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.320]   for eight days.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.720]   And so it would light up the whole temple.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.960]   And the purpose of this lighting was to remember that while they were in the desert, during
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.360]   the day, the cloud would, cloud would be with them and God's presence would be with them.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.120]   And whenever the cloud would move, they would move with the cloud.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.920]   But at night, there would be this fire, right?
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.740]   And the fire would lead them in the darkness in the desert.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.520]   And so wherever the fire moved, they would move.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.640]   So they would light this torch to remind the nation of Israel that this is how God led
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640]   them.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.120]   And that torch, every time they saw it, would remind them that the Messiah was going to
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.080]   come and they would also be led, like the fire led them through the desert.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.720]   So it was at that ceremony, looking at that lamp that Jesus is telling the nation of
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.120]   Israel, I am that light.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.900]   I am the Messiah.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.400]   But you'll be interested if you read the rest of chapter eight.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.680]   Remember, we looked at chapter six and it starts out with them wanting to make Jesus
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   king.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.240]   Well, chapter eight begins with people kind of questioning him in the middle of the chapter,
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.600]   chapter 30, chapter eight, verse 31.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.560]   He says many of the Jews believed him.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.920]   And so he's talking to Jews who have believed him in the context of him saying, I am the
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920]   light.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.520]   He says, if you abide in me, right, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   free.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.840]   And then they have, he has this encounter with these Jews who believed him.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.920]   But at the end of the chapter, it says they wanted to kill him.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.040]   So we see in the first, in chapter six, they want to make him king.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.800]   And then chapter 666, because of what he says, they wanted to leave.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.280]   Chapter eight, Jesus says he's the light of the world.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.720]   And as a result of what he says at the end of the chapter, they want to kill him.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:28.020]   So Jesus is correcting something about their belief about the Messiah that was skewed.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.960]   So whatever it is that you were thinking was normal was unbiblical, wasn't correct.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.400]   So Jesus says that he has come to bring true light.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.200]   So what we want to do this morning is to look at three aspects of what this light represents.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.700]   What did Jesus mean and how did they understand it?
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.180]   And what does the Bible teach us about that?
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.300]   So the way I phrase it so that it could be easier to follow along in these three ways,
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.420]   what does the darkness represent in light of the light?
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.320]   So the first one.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.980]   So if you're looking at the outline, those of you who are at home, darkness represents
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.820]   ignorance as light represents revelation.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.500]   Darkness represents ignorance as light represents revelation.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:18.100]   All throughout the scripture, it is stated that the reason why the Israelites were straying
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.840]   from God is because they did not know him, Isaiah 513.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.220]   Therefore my people go into exile for their lack of knowledge.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.900]   Isaiah 4.6, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.500]   As Christ was hanging on the cross, he cries out to his father, said, "Father, forgive
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.820]   them for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:44.420]   In other words, they were completely blind.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.580]   Whatever it was that they thought that they saw was wrong.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.800]   They were looking in the darkness.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.200]   So when Jesus says he is the light, he's basically saying is, I came to open your eyes to see
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.260]   the truth.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.500]   To cause us to see, to shed light on what is truth.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:08.080]   In John 1.9, it says, "There was a true light which was coming into the world, which enlightens
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080]   every man."
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.460]   So in other words, when he says to the Jews, I am the light of the world, he's telling
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.900]   them that everything that I'm telling you is true.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.340]   I came to bring you truth.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.220]   Which many of them would have been offended by because all this time the Jews thought
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.260]   that they had the truth.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.860]   They had the Old Testament.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.540]   They had the prophets.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.800]   They had all their experiences.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.420]   They had all these festivals.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.260]   So when Jesus shows up and says, no, I am the truth.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.020]   And he was basically telling them that they're blind.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.580]   So if you look at the encounter that Jesus has with them, they're very offended by what
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.260]   they say, what he says.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.860]   So it wasn't just a, I am the light of the world.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.840]   You know, it's like, oh, okay, you're light, we're light, we're all light.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.820]   They knew exactly what he was saying.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:04.000]   2 Corinthians 4.6, it says, "For God who said, let light shine out of darkness, is the one
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.820]   who has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.020]   face of Christ."
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.940]   The primary thing that they were ignorant about was God himself.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:22.220]   And he says, Jesus says, the reason why he came was to shed light of his glory.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:28.940]   The Bible tells us that people who do not follow Christ, people who are not Christians,
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.860]   it's because the God of this age, Satan, has blinded the mind of the unbeliever so they
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.180]   do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:42.020]   So in other words, he says a non-Christian is somebody who remains blind.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.760]   A Christian is one whose eyes have been open to the truth.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.580]   And so because we saw the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we saw God's glory, we are
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.580]   changed.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.780]   And that's exactly what Jesus means when he says, I am the light.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:02.100]   I have come to turn on the light so that you may see.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.580]   Well how did Jesus do that?
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.160]   Which is really interesting because, remember I told you in the Feast of Booths, for eight
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.940]   days they would set up a tent, a temporary shelter where they would sleep outside of
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.060]   their home, remembering how God led them through the desert.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:27.100]   What Jesus has described in John chapter 114, the word became flesh and he says, dwelt among
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.020]   us.
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.940]   The word for dwelt here literally means to pitch a tent.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.920]   That Jesus Christ came and he pitched a tent among us.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.860]   And so one of the primary aspects of this festival was to live in their tents and these
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:50.460]   tents represented God's presence, how God delivered them in the midst of being lost
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.620]   in the desert.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:59.640]   When Jesus came, turned on the light, he pitched the tent among us and says, we saw his glory,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:05.660]   glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:12.660]   So first and foremost, what he means by him being the light, that he came and he pitched
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:18.660]   a tent among us so that we may open our eyes and to see the glory.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.900]   Because the Bible describes all of mankind as falling short of that glory and we could
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:29.980]   not by ourselves reach that glory, so what Jesus did was he came to us and turned the
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.480]   light on so that we may again see that glory.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.720]   And that's a distinction between somebody who is changed and not changed.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.920]   Somebody who's just a churchgoer, somebody who grew up in the church, somebody who's
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:53.500]   culturally Christian versus somebody who is born again, completely radically changed forever.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.080]   It's not a distinction between somebody who goes to church, memorizes scripture, was raised
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.300]   in a Christian family, who leads.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.880]   The distinction between a Christian and non-Christian is somebody whose eyes have been opened by
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.240]   the light and the glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:13.200]   In John 14, 8 through 9, Philip says to Jesus, "Lord, show us the Father and it is enough
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   for us."
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.400]   Jesus said to him, "Have I been so long with you and yet you have not come to know me,
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   Philip?
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.840]   He who has seen me has seen the Father.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.160]   How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.880]   In other words, Jesus was saying exactly what the rest of scripture says.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.600]   He came to reveal God.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.720]   Hebrews 4, 1, 3, "He is a radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:45.000]   nature, God's nature, and upholds all things by the word of his power."
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.760]   You know, in Acts 17, 26 through 29, when Paul was introducing God and Christ to the
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.120]   Athenians, this is how he described it.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.960]   He said, "He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.000]   earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, that
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.920]   they would seek God."
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:16.360]   In other words, God has put boundaries and God has done all these things in creation
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.600]   for the purpose of his creation to look at these things and say, "Who is this?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.000]   Who did this?" and that they would seek God.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.640]   If perhaps they might grow for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.760]   us, for in him we live and move and exist.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:40.760]   As even some of your own poets have said, "For we also are his children."
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:49.040]   Christ came, turned on the light, and by seeing him would initiate in us a desire to have
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.320]   more, to continue to seek.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.960]   And that's why Jesus says in Matthew 7, 7, "Ask and it will be given to you, seek and
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.080]   you will find, knock and it will be opened to you."
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.640]   You know, before we met Christ, right, and some of you guys may be able to relate to
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:09.680]   that, but I remember the day that I met Christ, everything that I didn't understand all of
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.680]   a sudden made sense.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.800]   You know, it was almost kind of like if you woke up in the middle of the night and you
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.840]   were at a strange house and you're trying to figure out what everything looks like,
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.840]   so you're touching the dining room table for the first time, you're going to the kitchen,
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.960]   but imagine if you had no reference for what they were, and you were only seeing things
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.320]   through your touch, and your eyes just weren't working, because your eyes are meant to work
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.760]   with light, but without light, you're using your senses to figure out everything else.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.480]   So imagine if your whole life was like that, you were blind, and you were looking through
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:51.360]   life through your hands, your senses, your smell, then all of a sudden, you are gifted
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.940]   with sight.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.960]   Light gets turned on, and everything that you were touching, that you kind of had a
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:02.440]   sense for, but you didn't fully see, imagine what that would feel like.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:08.280]   Well, every Christian, whether it happened gradually, whether it happened all of a sudden
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.880]   like it did for me, knows exactly what I'm talking about, because that's exactly how
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.320]   life felt.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.720]   The moment I met Christ, everything that I was trying to figure out, why am I the way
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.600]   I am, why are my parents the way they are, why did we come to the US, why are we this,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:31.120]   and why is my dad that, and all of these questions all of a sudden made sense.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.880]   God did this.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.720]   That was God's purpose.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.880]   God was doing this for this reason.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.760]   That's what the Bible says, what Christ does.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.920]   When he turns on the light, all of a sudden, we see things through his light.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.280]   That's what it says in Psalm 36, verse 7.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.120]   In your light, we see light.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:04.800]   Until our eyes are opened by the author of light, God himself, Christ, everything that
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.840]   we're trying to figure out, everything that we're trying to figure out is like in darkness,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.600]   using these senses.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.320]   It's almost like you have eyes, but you're not using it, because our sin has blinded
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   us.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.960]   So the first thing that the Bible says about who Jesus is, I am the light, it means he
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.320]   came to open our eyes.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.600]   Open our eyes.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.040]   So when our eyes are open, the world no longer looks the same.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.100]   What makes us happy, it's just not the same.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.020]   What causes security is not the same.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.200]   What is normal is no longer the same.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.880]   And I think the benefit now for us to have the whole world flipped upside down is a good
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:51.840]   opportunity for us to take a step back and ask ourselves, what is normal as a Christian?
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:58.040]   Through the lens of his light, now that we see everything, what is it that we consider
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   normal?
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.000]   What is it that we want to get back to?
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.340]   Is that truly normal?
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.440]   Or is that part of going astray?
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.720]   And that's the first meaning, what Jesus meant.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   I am the light.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.880]   Not only for us, but for the whole world.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:25.480]   Secondly, darkness represents sinfulness, as light represents righteousness.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.640]   Darkness represents sinfulness, as light represents righteousness.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.840]   The ignorance wasn't simply because they weren't taught.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.320]   The Bible says that ignorance happened as a result of their moral failure.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.280]   Romans chapter 1, 21-23, "For even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.720]   or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish hearts
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.440]   were darkened.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.360]   Professing to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.920]   for an image in the form of corruptible man and of the birds of the four-footed animals
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.480]   and crawling creatures."
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:08.280]   Do you notice how he says, "They professed to be wise, but they became fools"?
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.960]   It wasn't that because they were blind that they began to be immoral.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.920]   The Bible says, because they were immoral, they began to become foolish.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:26.440]   You know, from years of doing ministry and counseling and teaching the Bible and talking
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:32.840]   to people, you know, I've talked to so many people who are at one point on fire for God,
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.060]   and then there's certain events that happen in their life, and they get caught in sin,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:42.680]   and then they begin to embrace their sin, and they begin to fall out.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.560]   And one of the first things that I notice, and it doesn't happen to every single person,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.320]   but it happens enough where it's predictable.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.480]   One of the first things that happens when an individual begins to embrace their sin
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.040]   is that they begin to become atheists.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.480]   Well, what changed?
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.040]   How did somebody who was on fire for God and at one point talking about giving their life
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.520]   and becoming a missionary, and then they get caught up in sin, and they're unwilling to
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.600]   let go of that sin or to admit it as sin, and all of a sudden they say, "I don't know
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.520]   if God exists."
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.220]   It wasn't an intellectual problem.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.640]   It wasn't because people didn't answer their questions.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:31.200]   Just like it says in Romans, when we allow ourselves to go into darkness, we cause ourselves
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.440]   to be blind.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.360]   In John 8, 31-33, Jesus has this encounter.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.440]   He says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   And the Jews get offended.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.720]   It's like, "Well, what authority do you have?"
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.120]   And he goes back and forth, and he says, "My authority comes from the witness of God, myself,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.040]   and the Holy Spirit."
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.160]   And he goes back and forth, and some of them get offended, and they leave.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.920]   But in verse 31, it says, "Some of them believed."
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   Verse 31.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.400]   So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed him.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.360]   Jesus says, "I am the light of the world, and some of them believed him.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.480]   If you continue in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine, and you will know the truth,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.240]   and the truth will make you free."
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:24.840]   Now, you wouldn't think there was anything controversial, at least in that statement.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.320]   If you heard, "Jesus is the light of the world.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.840]   He just said he was God.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.560]   That he's the light that they've been waiting for.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.280]   That the reason why they lit that temple up every year for hundreds of years."
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.940]   He says, "I am that light."
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:46.580]   You would think Jews who are able to believe that, that what he says here is really innocuous.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:51.900]   He said, "If you believe I am the light," he said, "well, if you continue my words, you
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.900]   will know the truth.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.020]   The truth shall set you free."
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.780]   But that word, "set you free," triggered them.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.780]   They got upset by that.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.860]   They didn't get upset by Jesus saying, "I am the light."
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.240]   They got upset because he said, "You will be set free," because it was personal.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.140]   Now he was pointing to them, saying that, "You need to be set free."
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:16.140]   So these Jews who believed him have another encounter with Christ in verse 31 and on.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.700]   And he said, "How can we be set?
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   We don't need to be set free.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.860]   Abraham is our father.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.300]   We've never been slaves."
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:28.420]   Because they were offended because Jesus just told them that, "You need to be set free."
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.980]   Back and forth that they go, and then Jesus ultimately calls them out in verse 44.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.380]   He said, "You do not know me because you do not know my father.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.340]   And your father is the devil."
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:47.740]   I mean, that's a long way to go from verse 31 saying the Jews who believed him and then
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.960]   saying your father's the devil.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.740]   And then in verse 59, it says, "Therefore they picked up stones to throw at him, but
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.780]   Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple."
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:04.220]   So people who believed in him was okay with the statement, "I am the light of the world,"
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:11.420]   but when he pointed out that you need to be set free, they got offended.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:16.940]   And those same people wanted to stone him and kill him.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:23.420]   You see, people who have embraced the darkness, embraced their sin, doesn't want the light
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.420]   to be turned on.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.860]   You know, just like imagine if you're three in the morning and somebody comes into your
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.700]   room and just flips the light on, right?
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.700]   You're going to be angry.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.940]   "Why'd you turn the light on?
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.940]   I want to sleep."
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.700]   But if you need to wake up at 7 o'clock and you have an appointment or you need to go
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.540]   to work and you're late and somebody flips the light switch on, you would thank them
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.300]   because you need that light because you need to get out of bed.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.220]   That's exactly how it's described, John chapter 3, 19 to 21.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:56.340]   "This is the judgment that the light has come into the world and men love darkness rather
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.620]   than the light, for their deeds were evil.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:06.780]   For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light for fear that
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.140]   his deeds will be exposed.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:15.140]   But he who practices the truth comes to light so that his deeds may be manifested as having
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.900]   been wrought in God."
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:24.380]   That's why an individual who embraces his sin, whether it is sexual immorality, whether
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:30.260]   it is his own pride, whether it is bitterness and hatred, they don't want to be exposed
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.260]   to the light.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:38.620]   They want to be where it is dim and darker the better.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:45.060]   You know, the scripture makes it absolutely crystal clear in 1 John 1, 6 through 7.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:52.300]   "If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.220]   practice the truth.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.580]   But if we walk in light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:03.140]   as the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin."
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:09.860]   See, Jesus came to not only open our eyes to see the glory of God, but in his light,
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:15.380]   once we see his light, only then we can see all things.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.320]   But not only that, he came to flip the switch on to turn the light onto darkness because
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   of men's sin.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:27.020]   Remember, the whole purpose of Old Testament history and the law was to make sin utterly
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.520]   sinful.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.100]   Because until they recognize the filthiness of the sin that is inside of each one of us,
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.260]   there is no need for a savior.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.780]   Jesus didn't come primarily to feed the hungry.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.140]   Jesus didn't primarily come to change our economy so that we can have a comfortable
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.820]   life or get rid of crime or make the country more prosperous.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.880]   To get rid of pestilence.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.820]   His primary purpose right now is not to get rid of pestilence so that we can go back to
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.060]   our normal life.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.140]   That's not his primary purpose.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:06.040]   His primary purpose in human history is to turn the light on.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.740]   And sometimes pestilence may serve that purpose.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.500]   Sometimes hardship.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.340]   Sometimes excruciating pain.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.100]   Causes us to see things that we would not have seen.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.700]   God turns the light on so that we can see clearly.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:29.180]   Because until we recognize sin as sin, we will never be able to recognize Christ as
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.180]   the light.
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:37.220]   See, 1 Timothy 6, 15-16, it says, "He who is blessed and only sovereign, the King of
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:43.300]   kings and Lord of lords, who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light,
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:48.220]   whom no man has seen or can see, to him be honor and eternal dominion.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.860]   Amen."
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.220]   Christ dwells in unapproachable light.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:01.540]   Until our eyes become open, until he turns on the light, we are not able to approach
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.820]   him.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:09.260]   And that's why when he says he is the light of the world, it's to show the glory of God
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.260]   and in light of that, to show our sins.
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:20.900]   See, a Christian is not a Christian who only repents at the beginning of conversion.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:26.500]   A Christian is a Christian because he continues to recognize his sin.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.720]   And he continues to repent because he recognizes the filth.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.380]   You don't recognize the filth only in the beginning.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.380]   He continues to, that's what sanctification is, is to move us along from the filth that
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.500]   we were okay with in the darkness because when we didn't have sight, we didn't know
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.780]   how filthy the couch was.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.820]   We didn't know how filthy the television was.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.940]   We didn't recognize how filthy our hands were until the light got turned on.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:58.060]   And in light of his light, all of a sudden, the world doesn't look the same.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:03.940]   So for a Christian, for a Christian who has seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:11.860]   and the world seems just as appealing as it did before you met Christ, there is a big
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:17.420]   doubt to whether that light was ever turned on.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:23.260]   Because the light gets turned on and when we see things as God sees it, God doesn't
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.540]   see this world as beautiful.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.140]   This is a world that is in rebellion.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.380]   This is a world that is waiting for judgment.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:36.940]   This is a world that can only be saved by the blood of Christ and we are only waiting.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:43.420]   We are only waiting as the creation is groaning for the sons of men to be revealed that he
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.020]   may redeem us.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:52.180]   For somebody who claims to have seen the light and has eyes have been opened and never really
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:31:00.220]   recognizes the filth that is around us is inconsistent with what the Bible tells us.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.260]   There is temptation.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.380]   There's times we can drift.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:09.900]   But when there is no distinction between before opening their eyes and after opening their
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:14.780]   eyes, at least in practice, it is inconsistent.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:19.220]   It is exactly as 1 John 1.6.7 says.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.660]   John is not saying, "Hey, you should work harder."
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.780]   He's just stating a matter of fact.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:30.620]   You can't say that your relationship with God has been restored while you're continuing
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:38.220]   to live in darkness because God is in light and those who walk with him will also be in
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.660]   the light.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.260]   Third and final thing that darkness represents.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:49.180]   Darkness represents lostness as light represents direction.
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:56.340]   As I mentioned, the light for the Feast of Tabernacles, Feast of Booths, was a constant
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.560]   reminder to them.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.540]   During the day, the clouds directed them.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.500]   At night, the pillar of fire would go before them.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.380]   So if the pillar of fire would stop, they would stop and camp out.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.940]   But when it started to move, they would take up and move because they didn't have navigation.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.580]   In fact, they didn't even know where they were going because where they were supposed
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:21.340]   to go, because of their sin, God would make them wander.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.500]   So it wasn't like, "We're headed to the promised land, so if you make this direct
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.500]   line, we're going to get there."
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.500]   God said, "No, you're going to wander for 40 years."
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:34.900]   So those 40 years, they were absolutely dependent upon this light.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.700]   And if you remember, the Israelites, even though they were large in number, they had
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.700]   families and children.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.300]   This was not, these were not soldiers who were marching in the desert.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.940]   These are families with small children.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.900]   You know, typically, I don't know if you've ever noticed, but typically, if you're out
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.940]   in the market or if you're trying to cross the street, and if you have small children
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.780]   with you, most people tend to be a bit more generous, a little bit more gracious because
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.660]   we're vulnerable when we have small children with us.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.940]   You can't go into battle.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.100]   And so we're not talking about soldiers, men who are marching out in the desert.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.820]   We're talking about a large group of community with small children and grandparents walking
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:13.820]   around.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:18.540]   And if any army wanted to come and attack them, they were completely vulnerable.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.540]   And this is out in the desert.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.180]   So it wasn't like there were food lying around everywhere.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.660]   In fact, one of their primary complaints was they didn't have enough food, they didn't
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660]   have enough water.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.620]   They were constantly complaining about that.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.700]   So what God told them was, "If I tell you to move, you move.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.080]   If I tell you to sit, you sit.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.660]   If I tell you to go, you go.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.660]   If I tell you to camp, you camp."
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.260]   So for 40 years, they were doing basic training.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:50.500]   And in the basic training, all they had to do was look at that fire and say, "Do what
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.220]   that fire tells you to do.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.980]   Go, stop, march."
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:00.900]   And so that fire not only represented the presence of God, it was their salvation.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.740]   Because as long as they obeyed, as long as they went where God told them to go, God took
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.460]   care of them.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.620]   So when Jesus says, "I am the light," He wasn't simply saying, "I'm going to open your
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.900]   eyes so that you may see the glory of God."
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:21.900]   He wasn't just saying that your sins are revealed, so now you need to repent.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.100]   He was telling them to follow Him.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:31.540]   In Psalm 18, 28-29, "For you light my lamp, the Lord my God illumines my darkness.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:38.860]   For by you, I can run upon a troop, and by my God, I can leap over a wall."
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:44.940]   In other words, when God lights my path, I can run upon a troop.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.860]   In other words, we're no longer vulnerable because God is with me.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.540]   I'm no longer weak because God is with me.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:59.060]   Because my strength does not depend upon chariots or horses, but on the Spirit of God.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.180]   And so that's what Jesus meant.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.060]   He said, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.780]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.580]   And that's basically what He was saying when He says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:17.700]   And He says, "He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:23.220]   In fact, the early church, today, if we want to identify somebody who follows Christ, we
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.140]   would say they're Christians.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.780]   Or maybe more specific, evangelical Christians.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.020]   Or even now, that's been watered down, so now we have fundamental Christians.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:40.620]   And we have more words that are added to describe a genuine born-again Christian.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:46.100]   The early church, you know what the first description of the early church was?
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.460]   It wasn't Christian.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.340]   The word Christian was actually given to Christians in a derogatory way.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.140]   It means "little Christ."
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:58.180]   Jesus gave that to Christians, saying, "Those little Christ, those people who are following,
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.460]   they're little Christ."
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:04.660]   But the actual word that the Christians used to describe themselves is mentioned in Acts
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.140]   chapter 9 too.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.900]   You know what that was?
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.220]   The way.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.900]   That's how they refer to themselves to the other Christians.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.860]   Are you part of the way?
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.220]   The way.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:23.260]   Because Jesus said, "I am the light," and they understood what he meant by that.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.100]   What he meant was, "to follow me."
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:32.340]   See, Christ turned on the light not simply for us to admire him.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:42.340]   We have people all around the world who say they're Christians, but all they are are admirers.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.160]   They admire the love of Christ.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.720]   They admire his grace.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.180]   They admire Christians.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.020]   They might admire the church.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.140]   They admire their friendship.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.540]   They admire the generosity.
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.380]   But they do not follow him.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:02.820]   The early Christians knew exactly what Jesus meant when he says, "I am the light."
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:07.460]   He who follows me, he said, will not walk in darkness.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:13.200]   So this is a Christianity, is a call not only to see the glory of God, not only to repent
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.920]   of our sins, but then to follow.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:23.740]   You notice at the Great Commission, he says to go make disciples, baptizing them in the
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.820]   name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and then what?
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:32.180]   Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.980]   It doesn't end with baptism.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.380]   Baptism is the beginning.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.840]   The purpose of why we go to proclaim the gospel is so that non-Christians can open their eyes
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.980]   and see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:49.080]   And when that happens, baptism is a symbol of repentance.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:55.200]   They are buried with Christ in their old life, and then they're resurrected with Christ.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.140]   So that's repentance.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:02.440]   The third part of it is to teach them to follow Jesus Christ.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.440]   And that's what he meant.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.380]   He says, "I am the light that they may follow."
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:10.100]   Matthew 4, 19, when he called the disciples, and he said to them, "Follow me, and I will
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.940]   make you fishers of men."
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.180]   That's the first thing he told his disciples when he said, he didn't just say, "Come after
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.020]   me, and I will show you miracles.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.980]   I'm going to reveal to you who I am so that you can marvel at who I am."
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.820]   He said, "No, follow me so that I can make you fishers of men."
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:35.020]   John 12, 26, "If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and where I am, there my servant
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.020]   will be also.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.540]   If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him."
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:48.220]   Finally, in John 10, 27, he says, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.220]   me."
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.380]   He doesn't say, "My sheep hear my voice, and they acknowledge me."
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:58.140]   He doesn't say, "My sheep hear my voice, and they admire me."
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:03.940]   He said, "My sheep, they hear my voice, and then they follow me."
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.460]   That we go where he goes.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.700]   We stop where he stops.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.100]   We speak where he speaks.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:13.220]   We are bold when he is bold.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.540]   We are gentle when he is gentle.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.660]   You know what's interesting is, if you look at the Bible dictionary, they'll give you
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:26.380]   all the synonyms and the antonyms of this word in the Greek.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.900]   I thought it was interesting because when you looked at all the antonyms of this word
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:36.420]   follow, the opposites of this word follow in Greek, it's interesting because it says
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.420]   the opposite of this word to follow is to lead.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.900]   One of the words is lead.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:48.820]   Obviously, you can't be following if you're leading.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:54.820]   Many people have already determined what they wanted, and all they're seeing with Christ
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.900]   is help me.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:57.900]   I want to go here.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.900]   I want to go to this school.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.900]   I want to marry this person.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.820]   I want to get this job, and I want this.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.100]   Jesus help me.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.340]   So they're not following Christ.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.780]   They're leading and asking Jesus to help them.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.340]   So the opposite of follow is to lead.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.380]   There's another word, to come late.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:29.700]   He said the opposite of follow is to come late, which I thought was interesting.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:34.300]   If you're following somebody, right, and if you come late, meaning that you come at your
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:41.320]   own time, when you're ready, when you're ready, you're not following, right, just like obedience.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:47.940]   If you tell a child, "Hey, I want to take your trash out," say, "I will, but when I
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.780]   feel like it, when I'm ready, when I'm done with my homework, right, when I'm no longer
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.460]   tired," that's not delayed obedience.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.340]   That's disobedience, and that's what he says.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:07.340]   Again, this is the antonym of this word follow is to simply be late or to fall short or to
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:17.380]   linger behind, right, or to stand off or to leave behind or to forsake or to abandon.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:21.540]   All of these words, according to the Greek dictionary, are the opposites of this word
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.260]   follow.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.020]   Disobedience doesn't always look the same.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:33.860]   Disobedience doesn't always come saying, "God says follow me," say, "No."
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:39.180]   Much of disobedience looks like not yet, maybe later.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:45.280]   Once I have this, if you answer me this, if you allow me to have this, and we're negotiating
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.780]   with God.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.340]   But the word for follow, when Jesus told his disciples, "Follow me," they left everything
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.340]   immediately.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.020]   They didn't say after a month.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.940]   Let me bury my parents first.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.780]   Let me take care of my job first.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.780]   Let me do this.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.780]   Let me graduate first.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:02.780]   Let me get married first.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.780]   No.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:09.500]   When he said, "Follow me," they left everything and immediately followed him.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.740]   And the reason why that happens is because in light of who Christ is, once the light
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:18.140]   gets turned on, whatever it is that we were looking at, whatever we were seeing, we were
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.980]   seeing from the blind spot.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.980]   We were touching things.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.680]   All of a sudden, he switches the light on and we realize we weren't on the right path.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.300]   We realized that we were possibly going to the bathroom in the living room.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   Okay.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.860]   I know that's a disgusting illustration.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.420]   But that's what we were doing in the dark because we weren't seeing things properly.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.180]   We may have been sleeping in the garage.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:51.600]   We have been, maybe we've been cooking lunch or dinner in the bathroom.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.020]   It's because we were trying to figure out in the dark and all of a sudden, he turns
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.420]   the light on and he says, "All of this is wrong.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.900]   Follow me."
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:05.380]   He wasn't telling us to follow him because he wants to make our life harder.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.220]   It's because every decision you made, everything that you valued, everything that you've been
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.460]   practicing you were doing in the dark.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.500]   And so he's telling us, "Follow me.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.500]   I will show you where you're supposed to sleep.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.620]   I will show you where I intended for you to cook.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.420]   I will show you where the car is supposed to be.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.060]   Your car is in the living room right now."
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.740]   That's not what the living room is for.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:33.700]   And that's why he switched the light on and he tells us to follow him.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:39.180]   Not only does he tell us to follow him, he tells us that we also must be that light to
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.220]   the world.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.900]   As he is our light, the scripture says we are to be the light.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.500]   Matthew chapter 5, 14, "You are the light of the world.
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.880]   The city set on a hill cannot be hidden, nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.780]   a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.180]   Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works and
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.680]   glorify your Father who is in heaven."
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.020]   If we are the light of the world and we live no different than the rest of the world, we
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:17.140]   value the same thing that they valued in the darkness, how can we possibly be the light?
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.660]   The reason why he tells us to be the light is to live as people that the light of Christ
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.580]   has been turned on.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:29.660]   It's been turned on and we see things clearly now with an eternal perspective because we've
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.580]   seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.980]   We've seen God's glory.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.420]   Even if it is dim, we've seen its glory.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.980]   We're no longer feeling around in darkness.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:47.660]   So that light that he has given us, he says now we are to take that light and go to the
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.660]   world and be a light.
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:58.660]   You know, a lot of times, you know, like you can preach the gospel, but if your life doesn't
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:06.220]   fit the gospel that you preach, all they hear is hypocrisy.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:14.540]   You can preach with power, with accuracy, with precision, with articulation, but all
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:22.980]   they see is hypocrisy because what you say and what you do doesn't fit.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:30.380]   So that's why he says not only to admire him, not only to say, "Oh man, I feel so bad for
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:39.460]   my sins," but to follow that we may also be that light.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:49.900]   You see, every one of these "I am" statements is challenging the Israelites' normal, normal.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:56.620]   What they became accustomed to, what they were hoping for, what they were looking to.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:01.700]   The only difference between the Israelites and the non-Christians, the Gentiles, was
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:07.660]   that the way to get to the top, the avenue to get to the top was different.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:12.980]   Where the pagans were praying to their gods and their idols, or they built up their armies
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:17.380]   so that they can conquer the smaller nations so that they can be the superpower.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:21.540]   The only difference for the Israelites at this time was the avenue in which they were
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:25.820]   going to achieve the same thing that they were going to achieve is through their Messiah.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.860]   The easiest way to get on the top is to have the Messiah just come and conquer and feed
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.980]   them and take care of them.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:38.940]   So when Jesus says, "I am," he's flipping their worldview upside down.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.900]   He said, "The food that you desire, I am that food.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:48.660]   The light, the Messiah that you're waiting for, I am that light.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:55.340]   The life that you are looking for, I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.340]   What is normal?
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:03.700]   Maybe for many of the Christians, what we consider to be normal really should be considered
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:08.260]   abnormal in light of what we profess to believe.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:14.220]   You know, if you look at, again in conclusion, Genesis chapter 1, the very first thing that
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.020]   God created was the light.
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.900]   Chapter 1, verse 3.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:25.860]   He says, "All he did, he said, 'Let there be light.'"
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.620]   That's all he had to do.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.620]   And then what did he say?
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.020]   And light was created simply by his word.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:39.820]   Just like he told Lazarus to give him life, to put breath back into him, all Jesus did
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:46.420]   was Lazarus come out and by his words with authority that he has brought him back to
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.780]   life.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:54.420]   God created all the light we saw instantaneously with the word of his mouth, "Let there be
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.820]   light."
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:05.700]   But the light that he has come to recreate life in us wasn't that simple.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.140]   He didn't just say, "Let there be light."
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.500]   He didn't just say, "You're saved."
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.160]   He didn't just say, "You're forgiven."
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:17.900]   That same God who created the universe by the proclamation of his words humbled himself,
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:27.420]   took on our flesh, lived humbly, humiliated, was beaten, punctured on his side with a spear,
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.700]   crucified.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:34.860]   All of our sins laid upon him, our burdens he took upon himself, and then he took our
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:39.460]   shame and atoned for our sins.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:47.060]   So the first light he created, even though we look at the vastness of the creation, all
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:50.300]   he did was, "Let there be light."
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:56.580]   But the light that we celebrate, the light that we have been given, Christ had to give
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.580]   himself.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:05.260]   And that's why, again, when Jesus says, "I am the light of the world, he who follows
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:11.340]   me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:16.620]   Maybe this period of quarantine, however long it lasts, whether it's a week or two weeks
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:23.060]   or several months, is a great opportunity for us to take some time to think, "What
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.000]   is normal?
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.620]   Has the light been turned on?
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:31.640]   Did I actually see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:36.060]   Has that caused me to see sin in the world the way that God sees it?
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:43.180]   And then thirdly, am I following this Jesus or am I just admiring him from a distance?"
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:48.540]   As we conclude, I asked our praise team to sing our final hymn, "Be Thou My Vision."
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.180]   So let me read this for us.
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.580]   And I know this is a hymn that we all know very well.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:59.540]   But again, I want us to sing very purposefully, just looking at the lyrics of what it says,
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.460]   because it relates to the passage that we looked at.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.420]   It says, "Be Thou my vision, O Lord my heart."
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:14.220]   In other words, let everything that I see, let me see light in the light of who he is.
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.460]   Be Thou my vision, O Lord my heart.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.500]   Not be all else to me, save that Thou art.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:26.940]   Let all other things in light of his light disappear.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:31.020]   Thou my best thought, by day or by night.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:38.140]   May the thought of Christ take the center stage of day and night, walking or sleeping.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.060]   Thy presence my light.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.820]   Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true word.
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:47.500]   I ever with thee and Thou with me, Lord.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.740]   My great father, I thy true son.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.900]   Thou in me dwelling and I with thee one.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:51:03.180]   [ Silence ]
