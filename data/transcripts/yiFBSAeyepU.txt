[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   Father, we thank you, Lord, so much
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.760]   for the opportunity to worship you.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   We pray, Lord, as we come before you as a body,
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.760]   we would remember Christ in all things,
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.760]   remember Christ's sacrifice for us on the cross,
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   that through him we're able to know you.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   We pray as we go into a time of a new Bible study session,
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.760]   would you teach us and remind us
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.760]   of what it looks like to be part of your church,
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   what a healthy church looks like,
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.760]   that we would be faithful,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.760]   that we would serve you with all of our hearts, Lord.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.760]   So we thank you, we love you, pray all this in your name.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   Amen.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   Okay, for those of you guys coming in,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   please go ahead and try to find your tables.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   The tables do have their numbers on there,
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.760]   so you can go get situated.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   But while I have all of your attentions,
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   I wanna cover a couple really important announcements.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   So we're just super thankful for an active body,
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   and as you know, for us, we just carry the burden
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   of cleaning our church together.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.760]   Your small group is going to be assigned a specific month,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.760]   and then we're gonna try to coordinate
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.760]   with our cleaning team, led by Martin Mao,
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   so that we can really divvy up the load
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   on when to do cleaning.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   So really fast, I know the wording is small,
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   but one, check your email,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   because you're gonna get a reminder.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   But just reading off really fast now,
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.760]   for the month of September, Daniel Eo, Alexi, Melissa,
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.760]   Grace Yellow, Keith Young, and Melanie Yi,
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.760]   these are the groups that's going to be assigned
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.760]   for the month of September.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.760]   Please do sign up, though,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.760]   because we need to see who's available which month, okay?
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.760]   I'm not gonna read the other months,
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.760]   but you'll get an email with a reminder
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.760]   that we're gonna be coordinating
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.760]   and doing a rotation for the cleaning service.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.760]   Next slide.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:16.760]   What? Oh, it's up here. My bad.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.760]   Thank you.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.760]   My fault.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.760]   Hey, would you--oh, thank you.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:28.760]   So, one, this is for specifically babysitting parents.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.760]   For students who are in the Sprouts Elementary Ministry,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   there is a PTA meeting this Sunday.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.760]   We need some extra hands to do babysitting during that time.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.760]   It's Sunday, 1:45 to 4 p.m.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   It should be more like, yeah, 3:30, the little end.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   So if you're available, please sign up for that.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.760]   Some of you guys have questions about babysitting.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.760]   Again, for the duration of the Bible study series,
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.760]   we do need hands,
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   and we really appreciate you guys' sacrifice
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.760]   to take care of the children.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   A lot of the parents of children
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.760]   are actually small group leaders here tonight,
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   and so we want to, you know, afford them the time
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   and flexibility to serve in that way.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   Please make sure you sign up for that.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.760]   Again, check your emails.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.760]   If you have any questions about babysitting,
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.760]   see our brother, Alex Coe.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.760]   Next slide. Thank you, Eugene.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.760]   For the sisters,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.760]   this is an important announcement for you,
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.760]   that Women's Ministry is hosting an event
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.760]   called "This is My Story, This is My Song."
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   Please make sure to mark your calendars for Saturday.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.760]   That's October 19th from 8 a.m.--
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.760]   8.30 a.m. in the main sanctuary.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   So you guys can do it now
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   if you think you're going to forget,
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.760]   but mark your calendar for that.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.760]   It's a sweet opportunity for all the sisters
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.760]   across various affinity groups to come together
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.760]   and fellowship that way, okay?
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   Okay, so I think-- can you hit the next slide
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.760]   to see if there's anything else?
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.760]   I think that may be it. Okay, great.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   So with that said,
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   we're going to switch over to our discussion questions.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.760]   Do I need to hit the button, Alex?
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.760]   He's got it? Okay.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   So this first portion,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   because it's the, you know, beginning portion,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.760]   and a lot of you guys
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   may see new faces within your group,
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.760]   please take this time to get to know each other,
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   get acquainted and familiarized,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   and use these discussion questions
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.760]   about how you came to church,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   how you became a Christian, et cetera,
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.760]   and some factoids about yourself
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.760]   that people may not know.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.760]   Share openly, you know, share intimately.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   Get close.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.760]   Tonight we'll get back together, usual time,
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.760]   which is 8 o'clock.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.760]   Please make sure if you're going off or to a room
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.760]   to come back just a little bit early
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.760]   so we can start promptly at 8.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.760]   All right, we'll see you guys in a little bit.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.760]   Thank you.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.760]   Oh.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   Oh, sorry.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   For anyone who is assigned to the newcomers group,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   you're with me right here
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.760]   in the front conference room.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.760]   So make your way over here at this time.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.760]   Thank you.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.760]   Thank you.

[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:38.760]   [ Indistinct conversations ]
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   [ Indistinct conversations ]
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:48.760]   [ Indistinct conversations ]
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   [ Indistinct conversations ]
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.760]   All right, it's 8 o'clock. We're going to get started.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:24.760]   Please grab your seats if you're not ready yet.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.760]   Okay.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   Obviously, today's Bible study or this session of Bible study
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.760]   is going to be a little bit different than what we had before
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.760]   because it is topical.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.760]   We're not doing inductive Bible study.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.760]   I want to explain what we're doing today
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.760]   and then to give you an idea
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.760]   of what the schedule is going to look like starting from next week.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.760]   Okay?
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.760]   So, as I said, how many of you have been --
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   this is the first time being in weekday Bible study?
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   Raise your hand.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   Okay.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.760]   I cannot -- yeah, can you raise it all the way up so I can see?
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.760]   How many of you -- for you, this is the first time attending Bible study?
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.760]   Okay, that's that whole group over there, I know it is,
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.760]   and then there's a bunch of them over there.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.760]   Okay, so there's quite a few of you.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.760]   All right.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.760]   So as you guys are attending the first time doing this Bible study,
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.760]   this is not normally the way we do Bible study.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   We usually go through a text, through a book, passage by passage,
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.760]   and you have to do the study and then come back and share,
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   and then we give you an overview of that text.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.760]   But this session of Bible study, we're doing this,
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.760]   and let me explain why we're doing it.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:41.760]   So let me pray for us and then we'll get started.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.760]   Father, we thank you so much for being gracious to us.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   Thank you for the opportunity for us to engage in this Bible study, Lord God,
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.760]   where we would learn and that you would really bring our mind and our hearts together,
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.760]   that we would be united in faith, united in commitment,
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   and united in our love for you.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.760]   We pray that you would bless this time,
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.760]   and may your word and your instructions have its effect on us.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.760]   All right, so let me explain again, to give you kind of a background.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.760]   In Judges chapter 21-25, this is a period of Israel's history,
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.760]   right before King Saul is established.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:26.760]   And during this period, Israel had no king, and it was very deliberate,
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.760]   because God established Israel, and God himself was the king.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.760]   So he didn't want them to be like any other nation.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.760]   But what ended up happening during this period is summarized,
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.760]   and this phrase is repeated over and over again.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.760]   So if you've ever read the book of Judges,
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.760]   they would keep on this cycle of getting into trouble, forgetting God,
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   and then the foreign nations would come and conquer them.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.760]   God would raise up a judge, and then through that judge,
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.760]   revival would come into the nation of Israel.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.760]   And that period is described this way.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.760]   In those days, there was no king in Israel.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.760]   Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.760]   If you notice here, it wasn't that they were doing what was wrong in their own eyes.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.760]   They were doing what they thought was right in their own eyes, right?
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.760]   Everybody thought that they were doing what was right.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.760]   But the problem was they didn't have a king.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:24.760]   They didn't have a central king instructing them to unite them under God.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   So in their attempt to do what they thought was right,
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.760]   the nation began to each individually just kind of go off on their own,
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.760]   and they were weakened, right?
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.760]   The reason why I read this is I think this explains
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.760]   what is happening in our generation with churches.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   Everyone is trying to do what is right in their own eyes.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.760]   They're not doing what they think is wrong,
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.760]   but they're just trying to figure out what is the purpose of the church.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.760]   Why do we do this? Why do we preach this way?
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.760]   Why do we have Bible studies this way?
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.760]   But where do they get that?
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.760]   Paul says in Corinthians 9, 24-27,
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.760]   "Do not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives a prize.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   Run in such a way that you may win."
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.760]   Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.760]   They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.760]   Therefore, I run in such a way as not without aim.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.760]   I box in such a way as not beating the air.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.760]   But I discipline my body, make it my slave,
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.760]   so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.760]   I read these texts to you because everything that we're doing at church,
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.760]   we're doing it for a particular reason, right?
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.760]   You may have come from maybe a Presbyterian background,
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.760]   and you come to church and say, "How come our church doesn't do this?
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.760]   Why don't we do the Lord's Prayer or the Apostles' Creed?"
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   There's a reason behind that.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.760]   We're not Presbyterian. We're Baptist church.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.760]   And so we have Baptist doctrine that guides us in what we believe, right?
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.760]   What we believe that's according to Scripture.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.760]   Maybe some of you guys come from a charismatic background,
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.760]   and you ask, "How come we don't pray out loud?
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.760]   How come we don't do this during worship? How come we don't do that?"
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.760]   Because you have a charismatic framework of how the Holy Spirit should be working,
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.760]   and so you're trying to project that, "Well, isn't this what the Spirit is like?"
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.760]   It's because we're not a charismatic church.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.760]   There are certain things that we believe the work of the Holy Spirit is and is not.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:24.760]   And so that's why even the way we pray, even the way we sing, is very deliberate, right?
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   So whatever background you may come from, you may come from a different church,
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.760]   and all of it, we're not saying in and of itself,
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.760]   obviously we're not in agreement, is wrong in and of itself,
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.760]   but there's a particular reason why we do things at church.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.760]   Why do we pray this way? Why do we preach this way, right?
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.760]   Some of you may come from a Bible teaching background.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.760]   So you project, "Because I went to this Bible teaching background, church,
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.760]   so we should be doing it this way," right?
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.760]   Even that, we need to ask ourselves, "Where does that come from?
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.760]   From Scripture, or does that come from the culture that you came from?"
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.760]   And so we want to make sure, as a church, that as our church continues to grow,
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.760]   that we are bringing everybody together to understand
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:11.760]   this is the reason why we do it.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.760]   And if you ask us why we do it, we want to show you where in the Scripture,
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.760]   while we were studying in the 27, 28 years that we've been around,
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.760]   what caused us to do ministry this way.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.760]   It doesn't mean that we're getting everything that we're doing, we're doing perfectly.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.760]   There are some things that we're still trying to work on, we need to grow in.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.760]   But there are certain things that we do and don't do specifically
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.760]   because this is what we see the Scripture teaching us.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.760]   And so we want to make sure that as our church grows,
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.760]   that we're not just adding number,
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.760]   that we, as a church, at least are together in understanding.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.760]   And so at the end of this, you might come and say,
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   "You know what? I don't agree with that. I don't see where you got that in Scripture."
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.760]   But we can't ask or demand of the church because I prefer this,
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.760]   or I came from that culture, or the church that I went to.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.760]   It's because we have different doctrines, we're viewing things differently.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.760]   The difference, even the fundamental thing is that as a seeker-friendly church,
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.760]   and maybe a reformed church like we are,
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.760]   is because our doctrines are different.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.760]   It's not simply the method, right?
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.760]   We want to reach the lost and so we have different methods.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   We have different methods because we have different doctrines that we believe in.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.760]   So part of the reason why we're going to go over the Covenant this session
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.760]   is so that we can bring you on the same page.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:30.760]   And if you have questions while we're studying through the Ten Covenants,
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.760]   hopefully you'll have an opportunity to discuss it in your small group,
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:38.760]   or even ask us so that we can clarify it, so that we can be on the same page.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.760]   When our church was smaller, this happened organically.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.760]   We'd have Bible study, or we'd have lunch, or fellowship, hang out at the park,
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   and so we'd be able to explain how we came to this decision, why we're doing it this way.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.760]   But because the church is getting bigger, we're not able to interact with you that way.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:57.760]   And so, again, that's why we felt the need to do this, to bring everybody together.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   Even though you've taken membership class,
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.760]   membership class only covers it like a very short period,
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   and you're not able to go in-depth.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   And even those of you who've been here for a while,
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.760]   you may have had conversations, but it's been a while,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.760]   so it may be a refresher for you.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.760]   So this is the reason why we're doing that.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.760]   The three core books, the book that we're going to be reading this session
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.760]   is Master's Plan for the Church.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.760]   But there's three books that our church requires.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.760]   At one point in church history, every single member,
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.760]   as they were coming in, read these books.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   We had discussion. Make sure you understood.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.760]   And if you had to have any kind of paradigm shift,
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.760]   it happened as you were reading these books.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.760]   But because the church is getting bigger,
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.760]   it's hard for us to even track who read it and who didn't read it.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.760]   The reason why we have these three books,
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.760]   and this was started maybe about second or third year into the church.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760]   One, holiness of God.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   And again, for the sake of time, I'm not going to go too deep into it.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   Holiness of God basically reorients our understanding of who God is.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.760]   If you grew up in a church where the primary teaching
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.760]   and the focus was how can we meet your needs,
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.760]   how can we speak in a way where you're encouraged
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:11.760]   so you can be a better husband, better community,
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   and you--again, in and of itself, it's not wrong.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.760]   But the central teaching of the Bible is about God before us.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760]   It's not about us. It's about God.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.760]   And to reconcile people to this holy God.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:29.760]   So if we have an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of who God is,
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   everything that you learn about the Bible, the gospel, the church, community, evangelism,
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.760]   all is going to be misunderstood.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.760]   It's kind of like taking a gift and putting it into the wrong basket, right?
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   So if you have a basket that's clean, then that thing's going to be clean.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.760]   If you have a basket that's dirty,
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.760]   then everything putting into that basket is also going to be tainted, right?
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760]   So it starts with the right view of God.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.760]   So this book, Holiness of God, helps us to understand who God is, that God is holy.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.760]   So if you look at all of the Old Testament, two-thirds of the Bible,
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.760]   the main theme of the two-thirds of the Bible is to teach us
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.760]   that sinners cannot have a relationship with this holy God,
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.760]   that there is a chasm between this holy God and sinful man,
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.760]   so that when Christ came, that they would have already been prepared
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.760]   that they are desperate without some sort of savior, right?
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.760]   And that's why the Pharisees were so rebuked, because they took what God was doing
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.760]   and they created a system of righteousness of their own.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.760]   So in some way, if number one, the holiness of God,
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.760]   if our view of God is off or tainted or incomplete,
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.760]   everything you're going to be learning about the church,
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.760]   how you evaluate if a church is good or bad,
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.760]   it's all going to stem from a wrong understanding of who God is, right?
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.760]   So if you haven't read that, I encourage you to read that.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.760]   The second book, Gospel According to Jesus, if you have a wrong view of God,
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.760]   you're going to have a wrong view of salvation.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.760]   If your whole perspective of salvation is God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life,
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.760]   so once you're saved, you're free, and now he wants you to be happy, right?
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:16.760]   And so if that's your paradigm, you're not going to have a right understanding of the gospel.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:22.760]   Because a holy God has been offended, Christ appeased his wrath,
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.760]   and so when he makes us his children,
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.760]   he says, "Be holy, for your heavenly Father is holy."
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.760]   So salvation isn't simply wiping away sin.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.760]   Salvation is delivering us from the bondage of sin
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.760]   so that we can be free to be righteous.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.760]   So an individual who is saved from the penalty of sin,
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.760]   but has not been saved from the power of sin,
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.760]   has not understood his salvation, period.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.760]   Because he doesn't understand who God is, right?
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.760]   That's the second book, Gospel According to Jesus.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.760]   Third book, the one that we're going to be covering over,
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.760]   is the Master's Plan for the Church, is where is this applied?
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:10.760]   If God is holy, and our salvation is to deliver us from the bondage of sin,
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.760]   to be slaves of righteousness,
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.760]   where is that new life to be practiced?
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760]   Is it just between you and God?
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.760]   No. You hear a lot of people say that.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.760]   During the pandemic, so many people fell out,
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.760]   and they have no need to go back to church,
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.760]   because they thought, their understanding of their faith is,
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.760]   "I'm saved, Jesus loves me, and when I die, I go to heaven,
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.760]   so it would be nice to go to church."
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.760]   It'd be good to go to church, but it's not necessary.
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.760]   Again, it stems from a wrong view of God,
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.760]   and a wrong view of salvation.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.760]   If Christ is Lord, where is Lordship practiced?
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.760]   Lordship is not practiced by yourself.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.760]   Lordship is practiced in the community where God reigns,
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:51.760]   which is His church.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.760]   And so, even the church, the problem that we have in churches,
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.760]   people don't know.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.760]   If I ask an average Christian, "What is a church?"
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.760]   And if you know even a little bit about the Bible,
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.760]   you'll say, "Where two or three are gathered in my name."
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   Wouldn't be wrong.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.760]   It wouldn't be wrong, but that's like a first-grader's answer.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.760]   It's not wrong, but it is very superficial,
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.760]   where two or three are gathered in my name.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.760]   So, if I gather me and Holly, and we go over here, that's a church.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   Every small table here, that's a church.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.760]   And then you jump into a pool, get wet, that's baptism.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.760]   You have dinner, eat some grape juice, that's communion.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   So, because people don't have a biblical understanding of church,
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   churches practice whatever each church thinks.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.760]   You know, we want our church to be this way.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760]   We want our church to emphasize this.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.760]   Our church is going to be our mission.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.760]   Our church is going to be our social justice.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:52.760]   And so, they're picking and choosing what they think is going to help the people.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.760]   Our primary calling for the church is given to us in the Bible.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.760]   We don't make that up.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.760]   No church has the right to say, "Our church is going to be about this."
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.760]   Our church is about the Bible because the Bible teaches us about what He wants.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.760]   We didn't just pick and choose, like, "That church is going to be about prayer.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760]   This church is going to be about evangelism.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.760]   This church is going to be about social justice."
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   No, we emphasize the Bible because Bible is where we learn what God tells us what He wants, right?
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.760]   And so, it's not that we're just committed to the Bible.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.760]   It's just that the Bible is the starting point of what God desires.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.760]   So, the master's plan for the church is, I think, does the best job and is more thorough.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.760]   It's not the most easy reading.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:39.760]   That's why next week, you're going to be reading two chapters because the first one is just an introduction.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   And then, second one, there's 13 chapters.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.760]   So, because today's introduction, starting from tomorrow, we're going to do two chapters.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.760]   Then, after that, we're going to do one chapter each.
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.760]   So, when you come in and we sing our song and you get into your small group,
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:56.760]   the first thing you're going to be doing is to discuss the book, right?
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.760]   Then, I'll give you a quiet time passages, and I'll explain that a little bit later.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   Okay. Now, having said that, because today is an introduction,
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.760]   I want you guys to maximize the small group time that you have.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.760]   There's nine different types of small group members, okay?
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:20.760]   And as I explain this, I want you to ask yourself, "Is this you?"
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:27.760]   Because after we're done, I'm going to ask you in your small group to confess, right?
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.760]   Which is you, right?
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:36.760]   And if you're not sure, we're going to ask people to judge you, okay?
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.760]   So, it's better if you're honest, okay?
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:45.760]   The first one is the dominator, right?
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:51.760]   If you have a dominator in your group, everybody is frustrated, okay?
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.760]   The dominator can turn any question into an opportunity to talk about themselves, right?
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.760]   This is somebody that no matter what the question is,
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:02.760]   you can be a male and talking about rearing children and giving childbirth,
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   and he's like, "Oh, yeah, I know what that's like," and then he'll go off, right?
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.760]   So, that's a dominator.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.760]   It's like no matter what the question is, you know, eventually, he'll soak up the attention.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.760]   The dominators suffocate any discussion by monopolizing the small group
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.760]   where others are not given opportunity to speak because he speaks too much.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:28.760]   So, again, ask yourself, "When's the last time you heard somebody else's voice in a small group?"
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.760]   Okay?
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.760]   So, in the context of talking, you say, "You know what?
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:36.760]   I don't know what that person's voice sounds like."
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.760]   Then stop.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:43.760]   Take a breath, go to the bathroom, and come back and give other people a chance, okay?
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:48.760]   If you have a dominator, one dominator could ruin the small group, right?
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:52.760]   So, if you're like, "Am I a dominator?"
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.760]   Ask somebody if you're not sure.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.760]   "Do you think I talk too much?"
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.760]   Before they come to you, say, "Do you think I'm a dominator?"
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.760]   And if they say yes, that's you, okay?
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.760]   Dominators tend to disengage when they are not the ones talking.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:13.760]   So, because you're not getting an opportunity to talk or you're so eager to talk,
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   you're just waiting for an opportunity for somebody to stop.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.760]   So, when you're not talking, you don't listen.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.760]   You disengage.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760]   You don't make eye contact.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   You seem bored until it's your turn to talk.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   That's the dominator.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   Dominators tend to sidetrack the small group to whatever topic they think needs to be addressed.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.760]   So, even though other people are sharing, the whole time they're thinking, "You know what?
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.760]   I think we need to talk about this," and you're already thinking about how to change this topic.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   Dominators genuinely feel like they are helping by keeping the discussion alive and interesting.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:45.760]   That's how they excuse themselves, right?
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:52.760]   That's how they articulate in their own mind, "I'm doing this for the glory of God," you know what I mean?
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   Because our group needs somebody like me to keep this discussion going, right?
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.760]   So, if you're not sure, ask somebody, okay?
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:08.760]   Because this person, I mean, maybe there's nobody in your table, but there's somebody, right?
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.760]   There's somebody at your table.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.760]   One of the most common, when we have small group discussions and we ask, you know,
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.760]   "What are you struggling with in your small group?"
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.760]   You know, it's almost every session, there's somebody who's dominating some group
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   and makes it hard for everybody else.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.760]   Make sure that's not you, okay?
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.760]   Two is the professor.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:35.760]   The professor has an answer to almost every question that is asked, right?
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.760]   He knows the Greek.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760]   He knows the Hebrew.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.760]   He's, you know, read every book, whatever topic.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.760]   So, whatever topic we have, he has something to contribute,
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.760]   and he needs to make sure that you know about it.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.760]   The professor believes that he has more knowledge and insight than the rest of the group,
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.760]   so he is morally obligated to educate everyone about what he knows to be true.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:01.760]   It wouldn't be right for him to stay quiet, or else you're going to leave in ignorance, right?
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.760]   So, the professor has to constantly be teaching,
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.760]   and you don't have to be a small group leader.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.760]   You could have been a Christian for three months,
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   but if you have a professor's attitude, right, you have to talk.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.760]   So, that's why the professor and the dominator don't get along,
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.760]   but it's usually the same person.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:25.760]   [laughter]
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.760]   So, the professor believes that he is doing God's work by speaking the truth,
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   speaking in love, part, he is working to improve,
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   but speaking truth, he has mastered.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:39.760]   He believes that if he doesn't speak the truth, then no one else will or can.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.760]   So, he's doing God's work.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.760]   So, if you're not sure if you're the professor, ask somebody, right,
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   somebody that will be gentle, caring, right, but ask them, "What is your honest opinion?
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.760]   Do you think I dominate?
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.760]   Do you think I'm kind of like—do I come off as a know-it-all?"
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.760]   And if they say yes, stop it.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.760]   [laughter]
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:05.760]   The next one is the feeler, okay?
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.760]   Feelers tend to think all this theology and study can lead to legalism, right?
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.760]   We're getting too much into this.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.760]   Aren't we just supposed to love Jesus and that's all he cares about?
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.760]   And so, anytime we go too deep into theology, it's legalism.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.760]   They believe that if the discussions don't lead to more love and grace toward one another,
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.760]   it is a useless endeavor.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.760]   What is the point, right?
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:35.760]   Jesus says he is looking for worshipers who will worship him in spirit and in truth, right?
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.760]   It's not just as long as my heart is right, it doesn't matter what kind of theology you believe.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.760]   No, it's spirit and in truth, right?
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   But the feelers tend to be so heavily focused on the feeling that theology seems to not matter, right?
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.760]   It's not like they're not going to say that theology doesn't matter at all,
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.760]   but theology is like two or three where emotions are like nine or ten.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.760]   The feelers tend to tune out when deeper theological discussions are taking place.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.760]   So, inwardly, you're judging the non-feelers.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.760]   They tend to come alive during sharing and check out during Bible studies.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.760]   You have a tendency to kind of like stay quiet until there's like sharing or somebody's in tears
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   or you're sharing something very personal and then they come alive.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.760]   But any time you go a little bit deeper digging, asking theological questions,
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.760]   they kind of tend to zone out, right?
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.760]   They're looking at you, but they're not looking at you, right?
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.760]   These are the feelers.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.760]   So, if you're not sure if that's you, feelers will tend to admit they're feelers, right?
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.760]   So, you probably kind of know because you're in tune with your feelings.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.760]   So, you might not have to ask, but if that's you, right?
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.760]   I was looking for people who worship spirit and in truth, okay?
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.760]   Directors, okay?
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.760]   What I mean by directors are not people who are directing movies.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:56.760]   This is the type of person who communicates everything very direct, right?
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:02.760]   Directors are people who tend to be direct and tend to come off as brash or insensitive.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:07.760]   So, if you say something that they may not agree with, they'll just say, "That's dumb.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.760]   Where'd you get that?
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.760]   Did you read?"
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.760]   Right?
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.760]   "Are you doing your homework?"
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   And so, these are the directors.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   Directors tend to be truth-tellers, but have not mastered the art of being tactful, right?
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.760]   And so, they don't realize that they're creating an environment that's hostile.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:32.760]   And so, it creates the feelers to feel unsafe, to talk, right?
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.760]   And oftentimes, the directors are professors and the dominators.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.760]   It's the same person usually, okay?
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.760]   So, when you ask, ask them, "Am I too direct?"
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.760]   Right?
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.760]   "Do I tend to be a professor?
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:52.760]   Am I a dominator?"
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:57.760]   And if they say yes, what's the solution?
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.760]   Stop it.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.760]   Okay.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   Directors tend to be--this tends to be me.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.760]   Directors tend to be impatient and want to communicate clearly without wasting any time.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.760]   So, we know that people who tend to be direct, they're not trying to be hurtful to you.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.760]   It's just that they're not patient.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.760]   So, they don't have time to go around and take five minutes to tell something that you
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.760]   can get to the point in two seconds, right?
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:27.760]   I don't agree with that, period, and then move on, right?
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.760]   So, it makes the feelers uncomfortable, right?
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.760]   Is that you?
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.760]   Devil's advocate.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:38.760]   This is a person that has a rebuttal for anything and everything.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.760]   They have to be the advocate.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:44.760]   Their position in the argument will always lean toward whatever position is not being
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.760]   represented.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.760]   So, it doesn't mean that they believe this.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.760]   They just think that the other side needs to be spoken.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.760]   So, if all your group tends to say one thing, they tend to be the opposite.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.760]   And then if they change their position, they'll go, "Well, you know, I'm not sure if that's
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.760]   all true either," right?
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.760]   They tend to disagree simply because there seems to be a consensus of something.
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:10.760]   They enjoy stirring the pot even if it tends to turn into a heated discussion.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.760]   So, if you are a devil's advocate, right, this person is not going to spoil the group.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.760]   It sometimes helps the discussion, but oftentimes you will frustrate the group, right?
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.760]   You'll frustrate the group because you're not seeking truth.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.760]   You don't seem to be seeking truth.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.760]   You just want to have a good discussion, right?
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.760]   So, sometimes it could be good.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.760]   Sometimes it could be frustrating.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.760]   So, just be mindful of that.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.760]   Is this you?
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.760]   Peacemakers.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.760]   Peacemakers are people who will never disagree with anything, right?
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.760]   If somebody says, "I agree with that," it's like, "Yeah, you know."
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.760]   Then, "No, no, no, no.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:44.760]   That's not right."
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.760]   It's like, "Yeah, I can see that too," right?
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.760]   They don't have a clear position on anything.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.760]   Peacemakers tend to think that the worst thing to do in a small group is to make someone
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.760]   feel bad, right?
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.760]   Even at times, maybe certain things need to be said.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.760]   It's like just the fact that you hurt somebody's feeling, that was wrong.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:07.760]   Peacemakers think that any lively discussion is not godly, prefers avoiding any discussion
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:10.760]   that may lead to anyone feeling uncomfortable.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:15.760]   This person has mastered speaking in love but is always struggling to speak the truth,
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.760]   that this is somebody that everybody likes.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.760]   Everybody loves this person, but they're all frustrated with this person too, right?
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:24.760]   Because there's no movement.
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:30.760]   They're overly concerned about how other people feel where they're not able to tackle truth,
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.760]   okay?
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.760]   Again, this person is well-liked in the group, and people love that person.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:41.760]   They make other people feel good, but oftentimes, it's very difficult to have honest and deep
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   discussions with this person because they're always kind of pushing against any kind of
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.760]   lively discussion, okay?
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:53.760]   Critiquers are always looking for opportunities to correct any little thing that needs correcting,
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.760]   right?
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.760]   Again, usually, these are the same people.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:02.760]   The dominators, the professors, the critiquers, they're usually the same people.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.760]   Critiquers usually are ignited during discussions that require critical thinking.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:11.760]   Critiquers and dominators tend to clash since neither have the patience to put up with the
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   rhetoric of others, okay?
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.760]   Is that you, okay?
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.760]   Then the hiders.
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:23.760]   Hiders tend to stay silent and in the background unless they are personally called upon.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   There's always just as much as there is a dominator, like in a lot of groups, there's
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.760]   always a hider.
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.760]   In fact, we have more hiders than dominators.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:40.760]   For every one dominator, I think there's four hiders from my experience, right?
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:41.760]   Hiders tend to stay quiet.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:46.760]   They don't like conflict for two opposite reasons.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.760]   One, they have a low self-esteem or however you want to call it.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:55.760]   I don't want to psychologize it, but they think, "I'm going to say something dumb,"
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:01.760]   and then the critiquer and then the dominator, the professor is going to correct me, so I
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.760]   don't want to make myself vulnerable.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.760]   They just kind of stay quiet.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:11.760]   These are the people who will never talk if you have somebody who's a dominator or professor
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.760]   or critiquer in the group, okay?
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:17.760]   Or the other part of it, hiders tend to be quiet because they don't think the other people
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:20.760]   will care, so they're judging you, right?
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.760]   They're saying, "If you don't care, why should I share with you?
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.760]   You don't care if I share with you."
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:30.760]   You have either, "I don't know anything enough to share," or a bunch of, "You guys are not
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.760]   worth sharing to," right?
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.760]   Sometimes it's both.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:40.760]   Hiders, again, you don't make trouble in the group, but you're very frustrated because
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.760]   the part of the small group is you want to get to know each other better, but if you're
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:49.760]   there and you're in the habit of disengaging or not talking, you may be doing that because
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.760]   you think, "I don't have anything to share," or maybe they're not going to care.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.760]   The way you'll come across is you don't care.
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.760]   They'll come across like you don't care, right?
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.760]   You may be projecting that to other people, but actually what's happening is they're going
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.760]   to see that you don't seem to care because you're not engaging, okay?
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.760]   Is that you, right?
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:14.760]   So any one of these people, and probably there's a mixture of all of this in our groups and
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.760]   in your personalities.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:21.760]   I share this because we have so many small groups and we want you to get the most out
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:23.760]   of the small groups as possible.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.760]   And so the next session, I'm going to ask you, "Which one are you?"
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.760]   And then I have one more left, okay?
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:36.760]   And the last one is the Flakers, right?
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.760]   Frosted Flake, okay?
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:44.760]   Flakers could be any one of those personality types.
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.760]   Flakers are those who see the small group as something to be taken seriously only when
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.760]   it is convenient, right?
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:55.760]   You have a member in your group where any little thing, like some of you guys have work
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:59.760]   that conflicts with this time, so obviously that's understandable.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.760]   There's things, emergencies that happen.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.760]   You get sick, that's understandable.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.760]   But I'm talking about Flakers where, you know, your favorite show is on and so I can't make
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.760]   it, you know?
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.760]   The Dodgers are playing today, so, you know, so this is not a high priority for you.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.760]   So you'll make it when you can and you miss when you don't.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:25.760]   So what happens is if you are a chronic Flaker, it creates, you have, you need to be aware
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.760]   of how it affects other people, right?
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:35.760]   It's very selfish if you don't consider that you not taking that group seriously makes
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.760]   it difficult for that whole group, right?
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.760]   And right now because our small groups are so impacted that if we have one group and
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.760]   we have half of them not showing up half the time, we're not able to hold the group because
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.760]   we have so many people that we need to add.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.760]   And so that's why Pastor Peter Trunk, I think it was the last one or the one before, he
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.760]   said, "If you miss more than three, we're going to pull you out," and he said it very
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:01.760]   firmly, and it worked for like two months, right?
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.760]   Even in the home group, the attendance was a lot better for like two months, and then
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.760]   it went right back, okay?
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:11.760]   So I'm not going to say three times or two times or four times, but generally speaking,
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.760]   if you're the Flaker, right, if you feel like, "I don't think I'm going to be able to be
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:22.760]   here for this many times," please let us know ahead of time, okay?
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.760]   That at least it's calculated.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.760]   It's because you see a schedule, you see something coming up, but if you're in the habit of,
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.760]   "My leg hurts.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:31.760]   The weather's no good.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.760]   There's a football game on.
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:34.760]   You know what I mean?
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:40.760]   My best friend, you know, wanted to have dinner tonight," that means that level of small group
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:45.760]   is going to go down to your level of commitment for everybody, and so it ruins it for everybody,
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.760]   okay?
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:52.760]   So because this is our first session, if you're going to commit to it, commit to it.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.760]   Do your best to come to every Bible study prepared.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:59.760]   If you know that you cannot commit to that, please let us know ahead of time, okay?
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:06.760]   So either we will put you in a new members group or a Flake group, all right, where you
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:12.760]   will be with other Flakers, so you don't have to feel guilty, okay?
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:16.760]   We're doing it for you, so you won't be judged, okay?
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.760]   All right.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:22.760]   So these are the things, again, as we're starting, hopefully you understand.
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:29.760]   I'm going to give you, you may have known this before, but in your small group, to actively
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.760]   share, and I'm just going to go over this real quick.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.760]   There's four areas in people's lives.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:37.760]   Me and others is a public life.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.760]   This is like, you know, what people can obviously see.
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.760]   After you spend a little time, they say, "Hey, you're outgoing.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:44.760]   You talk.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:45.760]   You're quiet.
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.760]   You're introvert."
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.760]   These are things that are obvious.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:55.760]   So what ends up happening is people who tend to put up a front are good at that part, right?
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.760]   Because that's where everybody sees.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.760]   But if you're only sanctified in that area, what do you become?
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.760]   A hypocrite, right?
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.760]   Because you're only good on the facade, and who you are behind the scene is not consistent,
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:10.760]   right?
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.760]   So if you want to really be sanctified, your outer person that people can see and your
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.760]   inner person is much closer, right?
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:18.760]   That's me, others.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.760]   Others only is your what?
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.760]   Blind spot.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.760]   These are people who are dominators, and they think they're the feelers, right?
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.760]   That's your blind spot.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.760]   And so how do you know that?
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.760]   When you're surrounded by people who are praying for you, caring for you, discipling you, they
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.760]   are the ones who will tell you.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.760]   Usually, your family has already told you, but you don't like them because they told
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:41.760]   you.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.760]   But there's probably some truth to it.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.760]   You have a tendency, and when your family tells you, they are usually direct.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.760]   They don't care about your family, and usually it gets exposed when people are angry, right?
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.760]   If you get in a fight with your husband and wife, they'll keep it to themselves for a
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.760]   while, and then you tick them off.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.760]   It's like, "How come you always do this?"
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.760]   And they go, "What?"
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:04.760]   And then you realize that your sister, your brother, your mom, or dad probably, or somebody
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:10.760]   has already told you this, but this is a blind spot that you kind of are trying to hide.
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.760]   But in a small group context, when you spend time with a lot of people for a long period
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.760]   of time, it gets exposed.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:21.760]   But that area, if you're not willing to receive instruction, you're not going to grow either.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.760]   Your blind spot is going to become bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:28.760]   That's why these small groups are good, because you're in a context where you can share, and
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:33.760]   people who are praying for you are able to come alongside you, and hopefully, tactfully,
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.760]   lovingly, help you to see that and to grow in that.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.760]   And then, me only is your private.
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.760]   It could be your private sins, things that you don't want other people to know, and they
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.760]   will only know if you share it with them.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.760]   And so, this part, you have to commit.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.760]   Others, you have to commit to people who are committed to you.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.760]   Me only, you have to commit.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.760]   So, the best place to do that is in your small group.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:04.760]   If there are certain things maybe you don't feel comfortable in, even in that small group,
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.760]   ask your small group leader.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:11.760]   If you have something that you're wrestling with, you want to confess something, to be
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.760]   committed to confess your sins, or confess other things.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.760]   And then, the God only are things that God does.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.760]   When you are sanctified in the other areas, you tend to be sanctified in the areas that
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.760]   you may not even know, and other people may not know.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:31.760]   So, small group is the best place to wrestle with this, and to commit to grow in all areas
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:33.760]   of our life.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.760]   All right.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:38.760]   Finally, starting from next week, starting from this week, next week we're going to be
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.760]   covering the first covenant.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.760]   We're going to, I'm going to briefly review the chapter one and two that you guys discussed,
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.760]   and then we're going to go into the covenant, and along with the covenant, I'm going to
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.760]   be giving you five quiet time verses for that week.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:57.760]   So, these are the verses that pertain to covenant one that I'm going to be teaching next week.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.760]   You understand?
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.760]   Okay, so, you should have gotten an email.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.760]   This is already on Facebook or Messenger.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:05.760]   Okay?
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.760]   If you didn't get one, make sure you get it.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.760]   And so, there's five passages, and I don't want you to read all five before you come
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.760]   on Wednesday morning.
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760]   Spread this out.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:15.760]   Do it like you're doing quiet time.
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.760]   So, tomorrow morning when you wake up, do one.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:18.760]   And do it in this order.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:19.760]   Okay?
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.760]   Because I'm going to be teaching in this order.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.760]   And so, when you come next week, and I start to teach about the first covenant, and it's
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.760]   going to be about the church, that you'll have some basis of understanding of the text
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.760]   that I'm going to be looking at.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.760]   Okay?
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.760]   So, these are quiet time passages.
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:39.760]   So, some of you guys in your small group who are memorizing Scripture, this would be a
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:43.760]   good place to do your memory verses.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.760]   You don't have to memorize the whole thing, but maybe like one or two key verses in those
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.760]   texts that you could memorize that and then check up on each other, if you choose to do
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.760]   that.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:52.760]   Okay?
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:53.760]   Any questions about this?
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:54.760]   Okay.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:41:02.760]   So, for the rest of the time for tonight, okay, which one are you?
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.760]   Okay?
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:08.760]   Are you the dominator, professor, the feeler, the director, devil's advocate, peacemaker,
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.760]   critiquer, or the hider?
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.760]   Right?
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:12.760]   So, choose one.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:13.760]   Don't say, "I don't know."
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.760]   Choose one.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:15.760]   Okay?
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:22.760]   And then, how can you, if you're one of those things, how can you improve going forward
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760]   in your small group?
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:31.760]   If you have a tendency to never talk unless you're picked on, like, how can you commit
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.760]   to participate in this small group?
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:34.760]   Okay?
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.760]   If you're the dominator, give other people a chance.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:39.760]   Right?
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.760]   Let them talk.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.760]   How can you improve on your tendency?
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:45.760]   Number two, what is the biggest weakness in your spiritual life?
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.760]   Okay?
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:50.760]   And what are you hoping to get out of this small group, socially and spiritually, and
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.760]   do you think you will be able to commit to the whole 13 sessions of the Bible study?
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:55.760]   Okay?
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.760]   So, for the next 30, 40 minutes, however long it takes, get into your small group and then
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:06.760]   discuss this, and then please do your five-verse quiet time and the first two chapters before
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.760]   you come next Wednesday.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:08.760]   All right?
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.760]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll wrap up.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.760]   Father, we thank you so much for this new session of Bible study, and we pray that you
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:25.760]   would help us to use this time to really learn and to come together to be on the same page,
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:31.760]   Lord God, as we are doing our best to be deliberate about the church that you desire to build.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.760]   Lord, as you remind us over and over again that Christ is the head of the church, not
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:40.760]   any man, not any purpose, so we pray, Father God, that these sessions will help us to be
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.760]   united together under Christ.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:46.760]   We pray for these small groups and the small group leaders and all the hard work that they
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:47.760]   are putting into it.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:51.760]   We pray that you would reward them to be able to see tangible fruit, and we ask for all
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:57.760]   the participants, Lord God, that not only knowledge-wise, but relationally, spiritually,
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.760]   in every way, Lord God, that we would become a tighter, more united community as a result
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.760]   of the Bible study we will have.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:05.760]   We thank you, Father.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.760]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:07.760]   Amen.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:17.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
