[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Okay. All right.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.420]   Welcome all of you here for the examination for eldership for James.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.960]   I've never seen a group of people more excited about an examination in my life.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.960]   [ Laughter ]
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.240]   I'm not sure if you're like that when you get tested.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.720]   But anyway, so I wanted to share a short devotion of what we're doing
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.320]   and why we're doing it in this manner before we get started.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.280]   We are an elder-run church.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.920]   We believe that it is the most biblical model that we see in scripture.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.220]   And I know that it's not the only model that the churches use.
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.680]   But we've come to the conviction that that's the model that we see in scripture.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.800]   And that's the model that we've been practicing for many, many years.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.580]   And we have no intentions of changing that.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.740]   Because it is an elder-run church, we have to make sure that the people who are
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.340]   in leadership are people that understand the weightiness of what it means to be an elder.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.440]   And so not only do we want the elders in the church to understand that,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.640]   we want to make sure that the church understands that.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.580]   So we want to make sure that the testing, again, you know, we were kind of going back
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.760]   and forth of whether we should do this publicly or not.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.040]   When we did it the first time with the, you know, elders that we have,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040]   we did it publicly because our church was very small.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.380]   And we wanted the, for the same reason.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.200]   And I was the one who tested the three of them.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.440]   And so they were three.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.760]   And it was in a small room.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.600]   And how many of you were here for the first time when we did that?
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.920]   So it's only a handful of you, probably less than 15 of you, less than 10, 15 of you.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.980]   So majority were not there.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.820]   So they also went through the same thing.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.600]   Except this time it's just James by himself.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.200]   So we thought it would be too much pressure.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.040]   And, but again, he was up for it.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.600]   So if he's up for it, let's do it.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.400]   You know? And so initially we were thinking about doing it just kind of,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.440]   it's just a small group upstairs.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.320]   Maybe we're thinking 40, 50 people.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.020]   And then the number started growing to 90.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.000]   And then people were asking.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.080]   So I said, okay, we're not going to fit up there.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.680]   So we chose to do it down here.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.240]   I want to share in Titus chapter 1, 5 through 10.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.200]   It says, "For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.500]   and appoint elders in every city as I directed you."
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.600]   If you notice in verse 5, he says, Paul is sending Timothy back to Crete.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.340]   And he says, "To set in order what remains."
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.060]   What remains, meaning unfinished business.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.820]   So Apostle Paul went and he preached the gospel.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.320]   And there were Christians already there.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   But he said the work is not finished.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.700]   And so in order to finish the work, he says, "I appoint, go back and appoint elders
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.440]   in every city as I directed you."
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.000]   In other words, the church is not established until the elders are established.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.440]   So Paul's intent in every city that he goes is to establish the church.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.180]   And the church wasn't complete until they had proper elders there to be able
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.580]   to govern the shepherd and to teach the group.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.440]   And if you notice, he uses the elders in plural.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.840]   He doesn't say establish an elder, but establish elders in the church.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.880]   And so that's what we do in the church.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.680]   We establish elders.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.440]   And as our church grows, you know, people ask, "We have such a big church.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.180]   How come we only have so many elders?"
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.760]   Because eldership isn't something you appoint out of necessity.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.500]   You know, we don't establish elders because we have 500, so we need 15.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.460]   So let's get the next 14 people in here and we plug them in.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.720]   Because you make a mistake in eldership, it unravels the church.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.660]   So it's better to have less elders than to have elders that we are not confident in.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.840]   And so that's part of the reason why we've been very, very, very slow in establishing elders.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.900]   So we want to make sure that we are taking that seriously.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:09.020]   In verse 7, you know, there's a bunch of qualifications that we can look at, right?
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.260]   And the point of that this afternoon is not to go through every single one.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.600]   But he says in verse 7 that this man, obviously above reproach,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.700]   but not self-willed nor quick-tempered.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.600]   And I just want to highlight quickly.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.540]   When he says not self-willed, self-willed meaning that you don't become an elder
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.200]   because you desire and you look for and you shoot for it.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.220]   And you've done certain things and maneuvered and then so you got noticed.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.500]   And how come I'm not an elder?
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.420]   And so the elder must not be self-willed.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.140]   This is not something that he wants for worldly or selfish reasons.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.780]   Also, he must not be quick-tempered.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.720]   Quick-tempered meaning that in the context, because it's plurality of elders,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.560]   it's meant to have discussions, right?
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.700]   It's meant to have conversations back and forth.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.140]   We are not going to have same opinions.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.680]   We're going to have different opinions about certain things that we look at.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.180]   Sometimes it's going to be strong, you know, opinions.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.320]   And so the church is meant to be discussed among the elders.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.760]   So if a man is quick-tempered and he doesn't know how to explain himself,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.060]   he doesn't know how to have discussions of strong opposition without losing his temper.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.100]   And if you don't do it my way, you guys are all dummies and then you explode the group.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.660]   It could ruin the church.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:34.400]   So this man must be able to speak his mind, to have strong opinions, and yet learn how to be able
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.360]   to be gracious in the context of difference of opinions.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:45.740]   He says he, this man in verse 9, needs to be able to hold fast the faithful word which is
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.100]   in accordance with the teachings so that he will be able to both to exhort in sound doctrine
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.460]   and to refute those who contradict.
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:01.180]   So the part of this testing is, the purpose of it is to make sure that every elder
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.700]   in our church is able to handle the Word of God accurately so that the opinions
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.500]   and the discussions that we have are not, well, this is what I think.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.600]   Well, I'm older than you.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.780]   Well, I have this degree, you know, or I have that.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.100]   And we don't want that to be the main reason why we have discussion.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.620]   When we have differences of opinion, it has to be because of what we see in Scripture.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.620]   So we need to make sure that every elder in the church is able to argue
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.820]   in the context of interpreting Scripture.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.240]   So they need to know, right?
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.080]   They need to know and be able to handle from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.720]   They need to be able to recognize false doctrine and not only to recognize it and say, "Hey,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.540]   Pastor Peter, there's something bad going on in there.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.360]   Why don't you talk to them?"
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.540]   Every elder needs to be able to sit that person down and say, "These are what's wrong,"
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.260]   and go through the Scripture and rebuke and refute them to protect the church.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.400]   So the elder is not only to govern the church, to shepherd the church,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.780]   but also to protect the church.
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.080]   And so, again, more elders who are able to handle the Word of God
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.680]   and who understand what the Word of God says, it will add to ultimately what we're trying
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.120]   to establish in the church, what God is trying to establish in the church.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:18.260]   To exhort, to be able to teach sound doctrine, to refute those who contradict what we know.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.100]   So let me just give you a broad outline of what we asked him to do.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:30.020]   So beginning of last year, we asked to confirm if there was any strong opposition in the church
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.380]   to establish, you know, possibly add him as a candidate as eldership in the church.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:43.520]   We had basically 99% approval in the church and with some concerns of certain things.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.620]   And so, again, we've scrutinized, we've talked to him in a lot of details,
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.720]   and I'm going to go over that in the part of the testing.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.480]   And so we've dealt with certain things that came up, certain things that we already knew.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.520]   Certain things that we wanted to bring to light to see,
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.360]   make sure that he understand to what degree.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.060]   And again, some of that is going to come up in the discussion
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.720]   because the testing isn't simply about knowledge.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.620]   The majority of it is about can he handle the Word of God.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.600]   But also, we want them to be aware, and we want you to know
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.720]   that we weren't just dealing with knowledge.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:29.060]   If the position of eldership is important to this degree that we would test a man publicly
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.500]   to know the Word of God to this degree, we also want you to understand that his character
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.540]   and certain things that we may have had concerns, certain things that you may have noticed,
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.480]   that we took that very, very seriously, right?
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.320]   If for any reason there was a blind spot, we wanted to make sure.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.100]   And so we've dealt with how he deals with people, dealing with money,
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.220]   both his public and private life at home.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.040]   And so there are a lot of things that we've kind of walked through with James in the past year.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.560]   And even in the last year, I can honestly say just from personally meeting with him
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.160]   that he's examined himself carefully.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.240]   And even in the last year, there's been -- that we've noticed progress, you know.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:18.120]   And there's been times I've sat in front of James literally in tears, just broken over his sins,
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.340]   broken over his mistakes, that he really wants to improve
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.080]   and recognizing what it means to be an elder in the church.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.020]   And so I want you to be aware of that.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.280]   It says in 1 Timothy 3, 6 that he must not be a new convert
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.400]   or else he falls into the temptation of the devil.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.280]   Again, we don't take this lightly because becoming a leader makes it difficult
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.200]   to serve the church.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.400]   It doesn't help because when the spotlight is on that person, there is that temptation
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.480]   to be concerned about what people think, right, naturally,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.120]   because there's more people looking at that person.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.540]   So if a brand new convert or somebody who's young who can't handle that can easily get
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.960]   to their head, either become overly concerned about criticism
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.980]   or overly concerned about praise.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.000]   And so all of these things have been considered in the context
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.140]   of preparing and getting him ready, okay.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.740]   So we're going to get into the testing portion of it, but I want you to know
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.140]   that because of time constraint, obviously, we're not going to be able to answer,
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.600]   ask every question that we ask him to prepare.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.920]   But basically know this, we basically asked him that from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.880]   if we pick any chapter in the Bible that he needs to be able
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.660]   to give us an outline, tell us what's in there.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.000]   He needs to be able to know the chronological order of all the events
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.780]   in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:46.100]   He needs to be able to refute any doctrine that we hold and any false doctrines
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.760]   that may be going around, and so we need to prepare for all of that.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.020]   So basically, the parameters, there were probably no parameters, right.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.820]   So basically, when he asked what should I study, basically, we said everything.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.240]   And then as he was studying, we kind of narrowed it down, saying like, okay,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.520]   now you can narrow it down to this, and then we gave him, you know, three months out,
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.500]   you know, focus on this, and then three weeks out, we tell him to focus on this,
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.220]   and so that's how we got here, right.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:17.060]   So we're going to choose different parts of it, and it's going to take about an hour, okay,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.180]   or we're thinking it's going to take an hour, or a little bit less than that,
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.620]   and we hope that's what we're shooting for.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.860]   So the format of what we're going to do is we're going to have the Old Testament portion,
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.540]   New Testament portion, and the theological portion, right.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.340]   And so Elder Joe is going to handle the Old Testament portion.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.100]   He's going to be asking the question.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.680]   Elder Philip is going to be asking the New Testament questions,
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.940]   and I will be asking him the theological questions, okay.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.700]   So my portion of it is going to be a certain point, and then at the very end,
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:53.140]   I'm going to ask him some personal stuff, okay, that he could not prepare for, right.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.540]   So, and I told him that.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.100]   There's going to be part of the examination
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.360]   where there's no preparation he's going to get ready for it, okay.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.960]   So just in case it wasn't tough enough, we made it a little bit tougher, okay.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.720]   So I'm going to ask James to come up.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.740]   I'm going to ask the elders to come up, and we're going to get started.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:33.560]   [ Background Sounds ]
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.360]   All right.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   What he has up there is not cheat sheets.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.540]   It's a blank piece of paper, okay.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.800]   Just in case.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.300]   [ Laughter ]
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:13:05.800]   [ Background Sounds ]
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   Is that on?
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.800]   [ Background Sounds ]
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.300]   >> Good evening, Brother James.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.300]   [ Laughter ]
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.300]   So we'll kind of jump right into it.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:25.300]   So as you well know, I'm going to be asking you questions about the Old Testament.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.800]   So with that, we'll start from the beginning.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.800]   Can you go ahead and outline the major storylines in the book of Genesis,
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.300]   highlighting the specific chapters that they encompass?
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   So that might be a drawn-out question, but if you need more details, you can ask me.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.800]   [ Background Sounds ]
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   >> With respect to Genesis in chapters one and two, you have creation, God taking disorder.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.300]   >> Can you talk into the mic?
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.800]   >> Thank you.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   >> Am I not using it?
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.800]   >> Can you guys hear me?
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.800]   >> Okay.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   >> With respect to the book of Genesis, you have God creating disorder from disorder.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.300]   He goes through the creation of all and then into mankind, and then you see the fall.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:17.800]   After the fall, excuse me, and then in chapter three, that's one and two,
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.300]   and then in chapter three, you have the fall.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.800]   You have Satan come in the form of a serpent.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.300]   He deceives first Eve and then Adam, and after that, you see the results of the fall.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.300]   Man is at that point going to work from the sweat of his brow.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   There will be enmity between Adam and Eve and from henceforth, man and woman.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   Eve would experience pain through childbirth.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.800]   However, in Genesis 3.15, you have the proto-evangelion.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.300]   You have God promising that he would one day crush Satan,
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.300]   but that he would also inflict damage by striking the heel.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.300]   >> James, James.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.300]   >> All right.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.300]   For the sake of time.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.300]   >> Okay.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   >> Okay.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   That would, it's going to take forever.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   >> Okay.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.300]   >> So give us a.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   >> I can go quicker.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   >> I can go quicker.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.300]   >> Okay.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   >> Yeah, okay.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.300]   All right.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   >> Okay.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.300]   One and two, three, we have the fall, and then four, you have Abel came and then Telemach.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:23.300]   Then you have from, and then in six, you have the Nephilim, six to nine, you have the flood.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.300]   Chapter nine through 11, you see the rise of Babylon, the fall.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.300]   Chapter 12, you have the hinge story of Abraham.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:41.300]   From 12 to 25, you have the journeys of Abraham with respect to 15 and 17, credited as righteousness.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   Respect to 12 and 20, his falling.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.300]   Chapter 16, you have him going into Hagar.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:53.300]   After that, from 25 to 36, you have the story of Isaac and Jacob.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:16:00.800]   Most pronounced in that is in chapter 27, you have Jacob deceiving.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   From 29 to 31, you have Jacob being deceived by Laban.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   And then in 32, you have Jacob wrestling with God.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   From 37 to 50, you see the story of Joseph and his brothers.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   In chapter 37, he has a dream.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   He unknowingly prophesizes.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   He is imprisoned.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.800]   And after that, from 39 to 41, he's imprisoned.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   41 to 46, you see him elevated.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   In Genesis 49, you see Jacob giving the prophecy that the star would come from the tribe of Judah.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   The Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   I can't go into more detail, but you're asking for a broad outline, so.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   [ Laughter ]
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   >> Hi, James.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   >> Hi.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.800]   >> All right.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   Let's go straight into it.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   Give me the outline of the book of Acts with in mind Acts 1-8 and how.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   Can you describe how it is fulfilled in the book of Acts as it progresses?
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   You said give you an outline of the book of Acts and you said something about 1-8?
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   >> Yeah, Acts 1-8 and how that is fulfilled throughout the book of Acts.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   >> 1 through 8?
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   >> No, no, no.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   Acts chapter 1, verse 8.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.300]   >> Yeah, as Jesus is ascending, he said, you know, go there.
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   >> Oh, okay, okay.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   >> Yeah, don't.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.300]   >> Okay, so you want, if I understand this correctly, you want the progression, correct?
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   The progression of the main characters through the book of Acts?
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:37.300]   >> Spreading of the gospel in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria to the remotest part of the world, outlined in the book of Acts.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:53.300]   >> Okay, so in the book of Acts, you start off with Christ being described as being on earth for 40 days and then he ascends.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.300]   So you see this picture of anticipation of the Holy Spirit coming.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.300]   Matthias is chosen in the end of chapter 1.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.300]   In chapter 2, you have the Holy Spirit actually coming in power.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.300]   There's wind, there's fire, and they're speaking of different languages.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:13.800]   Once that happens, Peter gives an explanation and sermon pursuant to the Holy Spirit coming.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   He explains the purpose of the Holy Spirit coming.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   He invites baptism and repentance and then baptism.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   And then after that in chapter 3, you have Peter healing a lame man.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   And then he gives a second sermon in Solomon's portico.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:40.800]   In chapter 4, Peter and John are arrested, told to no longer speak in his name.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   And then afterwards, the church is told of this.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   They pray for boldness. They share everything.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   In chapter 5, you have Ananias and Sapphira lying to the Holy Spirit and because of that being judged.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   And once again, the apostles are arrested.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.800]   They're freed by an angel.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   They're told to go back again to the very people that they were freed from.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:12.800]   And because they were ordered not to speak in his name, they were going to be executed, but Gamaliel stays the execution.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   And then in chapter 5, in chapter 6, you have Stephen being chosen as one of the seven deacons.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:34.800]   And after that, the later part of Acts chapter 6 is devoted to Stephen and his wisdom and his miracles.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   And it specifically says that due to his wisdom and his miracles, he was seized.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   In chapter 7, he gives a response to that, right?
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   And he goes from Abraham to Solomon.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   The content of his sermon is from Abraham to Solomon.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   And the point of his sermon is that the prior, your fathers were stiff-necked and so you are also stiff-necked.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.800]   And he has a heart and then he is martyred.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   There's a little footnote, not a footnote, but there's a verse at the end where it says that Saul approved of this.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   In chapter 8, you see Saul ravaging the church.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   His persecution is continuing.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   Despite that, you see the church thriving because you see Philip going to Samaria.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   And there's a parenthesis portion where you see Simon the magician, he believes, but then he wants it for gain.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   And so because of that, he asks to pay to have the power of the spirit.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.300]   He's...
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.800]   >> Yeah, a little bit broader.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   >> Okay, a little bit broader.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   Okay.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   All right, a little bit broader.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   So then in chapter...
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   A little bit broader than that.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   Okay.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   Sorry.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   Okay.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   In chapter 10, you have the vision of Peter having a vision, neck coming down, and it happening three times where he's told to eat because God has now made a queen.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   Then he goes, visits Cornelius' house.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   Cornelius' house receives the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.300]   And after that, you see Peter right after that in chapter 11 telling the circumcision.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   He's telling the circumcision, "Hey, look, the Holy Spirit came upon this family.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.300]   They received the Holy Spirit just like we received the Holy Spirit."
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   Now, what's noteworthy is that in Acts 2, when the Holy Spirit came upon different individuals, they were men from different lands.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.300]   However, they were God-fearing Jews because they had came for the festival, right?
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.300]   They came for Pentecost, so they were already God-fearing.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   This is different, right?
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.300]   This is different, right?
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.800]   They were not proselytized into the Jewish faith.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   Cornelius and his family, although they are God-fearing believers, they weren't on the same level as these Jewish proselytes, but the Holy Spirit comes on them.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   So right after that, Peter has to explain to them, "Hey, look, the Holy Spirit fell on them," right?
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   And then after that in chapter 12, chapter 13 to 15, you have the missionary, first missionary journey of Paul, Paul and Barnabas.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   And then the second missionary journey occurs in 15 to 18, the third in 18 to 21.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:56.300]   What's noteworthy is that with respect to Acts 15, you have the Jerusalem Council.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:06.300]   And then up to that point, right before Acts 15, right, you have Acts chapter 8, where Philip is going to Samaria and preaches to the Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:12.300]   You have Acts chapter 10 and 11, like I just described, where the Holy Spirit fell on Cornelius and his family.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   And so you have a Jewish sect coming in, and they're saying, "They must first be circumcised according to the custom of Moses."
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   And so the question arose, "Do you first need to become Jewish to be a Christian?"
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   And on top of that, "If you're Christian, do you need to conform to the custom of Moses?"
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   And that's dealt with in Acts chapter 15, right?
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:44.800]   In Acts chapter 15, what happens is Peter explains what happened with respect to Acts chapter 10 and 11, that he saw the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   And then James, the Lord's brother, also says, "They should not bear a yoke that our fathers could not bear."
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   A little bit broader. So following the outline of Jerusalem, right?
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   And so you've explained how that has transitioned into the Gentiles and then Samaria.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:10.300]   So if you can just give us a broad outline, because we want to get to the other questions too, about how the progression of the gospel.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.800]   Sure. And then I'll skip to, I think what's noteworthy are the missionary journeys.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   You see Paul going to, depending on which missionary journey, first Lystra, Pergamum, Antioch, Iconium, Cyprus, and the last is Lystra.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   And after that, with respect to a second missionary journey, you see Paul going back to Derbe and Lystra, Philippi in Macedonia.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   And then you see him go to Thessalonica, Berea, and then what's noteworthy is Athens, right?
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.800]   Because in Athens, he's preaching to the philosophers in the marketplace.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   And so now, in the first missionary, Paul said, "You know what? I'm going to give up. I'm going to go to the Gentiles."
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   He already said that, but he was still going to the synagogues.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   Here, you see him actually going to a predominantly Gentile city that was the epicenter of Gentile influence,
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   specifically Greek and Roman, well, Greek philosophy at the time.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for, but okay.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   Alright, here's a theological question.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   What is the primary distinction between covenant theology and dispensational theology, and why is this important for the average Christian?
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   I think to explain the primary difference, one needs to understand, at least with respect to its definition, right?
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   Both are gridlocks, grids to view the Bible.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   One views the Bible a certain way. Covenant theology views the Bible a certain way.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   Dispensational theology views the Bible a different way.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   Covenant views it based on a major covenant, and then subordinate covenants under that.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   Dispensational theology views the Bible as God working progressively and through different ways throughout times.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   Generally speaking, there's different levels. There's classical, and there's progressive.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   And even within covenant theology, they might differ on certain fine points.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   But generally, that's how they kind of view each other.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   So, the bottom line difference, because you're viewing one pursuant to a covenant, and one pursuant to God working, for the most part, in different ways throughout different times,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   the primary difference becomes a hermeneutic.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   Because you're looking at something specifically through a covenant, God is working this way, and one, you're not.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   He's just working, right?
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   So what ends up happening is, with covenant theologians, I'll fast forward a little bit.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   With covenant theologians, what they will say is, "All the promises to national Israel have now been disinherited and are now fulfilled in Christ."
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   And they say that because of their framework.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   Dispensational theologians will not say that.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   They'll say, "The promises with respect to the nation of Israel are still binding, and they will occur."
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:19.800]   So, you have in Isaiah 49, for example, where God says, "You're the new Israel."
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   Peter says the same thing, "We are the new Israel."
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   And so they take those verses and say, "Therefore, we're the new Israel."
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   And covenant theologians, the other argument is, throughout time, God has, in essence, at many times, disinherited a majority of the population, hence the term "remnant."
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   He always says "remnant."
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   But where that fails, in my opinion at least, I'm sorry there isn't a covenant theologian here, but I'm trying to be objective here.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   The portion where that fails is that the promises were specifically to the nation of Israel.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   And so, if you want to talk about some of the promises, right?
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   Isaiah 49 to 55, with respect to the coming of the Messiah, and then at the end, with respect to the second coming.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   You want to talk about Hosea 3 and Hosea 14.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   You want to talk about Joel 3.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   You want to talk about Malachi 4.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   You want to talk about Obadiah, the last verses of Obadiah.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   You want to talk about Amos 9.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   These are all promises, Zechariah 12 to 14.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   These are all promises to the nation of Israel that a physical kingdom will be set up.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   So if you're a covenant theologian, your thinking is, because the nation of Israel has been disinherited, now we have Jesus.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   The promises are fulfilled in him.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   So if we skip to Revelation 20, and this is where the biggest difference is.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   If you skip to Revelation 20, the millennial kingdom is happening now.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   That's what they typically say.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   If you're a covenant theologian, a faithful one, you're going to say, "I'm either amillennial or postmillennial."
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   Postmillennialism has kind of fallen out the wayside, but you're an amillennial.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   So the kingdom is here, and it's now, and we can bring it in, and Jesus is reigning.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   The dispensational theologist will say, "It's already, but not yet."
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   He's reigning in one sense, but he will reign another sense in a physical way.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   So I want you to now speak to a college student who's sitting there.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   What does that mean to me?
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   Why is it important to them?
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   To the college student?
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   And explain it to a college student.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   All right.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   Not that you guys, you know what I mean.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   [laughter]
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   I need to look at a college student.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   Caleb, all right.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   So I'm looking at you, Caleb.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   So, Caleb, the reason it's important is because--
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   [laughter]
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   The reason it's important is because when you come to the Word of God, right,
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   you want to have a high view of the Word of God.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   And one of the prerequisites to having a high view of the Word of God is the following.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   Do I believe God said this?
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   Do I believe God said this?
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   In my opinion, when you hear God saying certain promises to the nation of Israel
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   and you say that they are inherited, they're fulfilled in Christ,
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   then essentially what you're saying is, "Well, I guess he didn't really say that.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   I guess he didn't really say that."
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   And then you have this overflow.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   If he didn't really mean that, if he didn't really say that,
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   what does that say for your salvation?
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   He saved you no matter what you did.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   But if you're really bad like Israel, he might disinherit you if you're really bad.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   That's what it essentially means because if you're saying because of their disobedience
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   that Israel was disinherited, then why can't I be disinherited?
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   That's Romans 11.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   Romans 11 says, "Hey, look, don't get--" I'm speaking to a college student.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   [laughter]
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   "Don't get uppity." Right?
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   Romans 11 says, "Don't get uppity." Right?
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   Because if the natural branches weren't saved, why are you going to be saved?
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   That's Romans 11. Right?
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   And so when you hear that, subconsciously in your mind,
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   the promises of God are there, but they're not really there. Right?
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.800]   "Oh, he can save me no matter what I do."
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   He can't really save me from what I did.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   But if you don't take that view,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   if you take the view that God did say what he actually said,
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   then the realm of salvation becomes a little bit more multidimensional.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   You do need to be holy, right?
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   And you are going to fail, but at the same time,
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   the Holy Spirit inside you, that seal, is a deposit guaranteeing your inheritance.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   I think if you're a covenant theologian,
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   I don't think you can consistently advocate that point of view
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   because if you say that Israel was disinherited, then I'm no different.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   And that's Romans 11.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   Okay, thank you. Now you got it?
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   [laughter]
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   Okay.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   Okay, we won't go through a long list of a whole book.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   We'll talk about the cities of refuge in numbers.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   Can you name all of the cities and the requirements given in numbers,
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   what chapters, regarding the rules and regulations regarding the cities of refuge?
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   Okay.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   The cities of refuge are six cities that are equal distance from the various other cities,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   and they're cut in half, east and west, from the Sea of Jordan.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   You have Kadesh, Ramoth, Gilead--
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   Hold on.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   Shechem, Bezir, Hebron, Kadesh, Ramoth, Gilead--
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   I forgot one.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   It's Golan.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   Golan, yeah, Golan.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   Golan, Ramoth, Gilead, and Bezir are east of the Jordan.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   Kadesh, Shechem, and Hebron are west of the Jordan.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   Sorry, I just want to make sure I got that right.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   Never each heard of each.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   East and west of the Jordan.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   They were equal distances from the Levitical cities.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   They were primarily designed for safety.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   If there was an unintentional killing, a killing without malice aforethought, right?
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   Involuntary manslaughter.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   You're chopping wood in the forest, you've got your axe,
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   and then your blade falls off and you kill some dude.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   You didn't mean to do it, right?
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   Now, that doesn't mean a lot to the daughter, to the son, or to the husband.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   It doesn't mean anything, right?
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   So the avenger of blood, he's going to come after you,
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   like pretty much anyone else would do.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   So because there was no malice aforethought,
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   God viewed that differently from murder with malice aforethought.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   So you can go to these cities that were set on a hill.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   You would come there.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.800]   There would be a trial put on by an elder.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   Depending on the result of the trial, let's say you stay in,
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   you can stay there until the death of the high priest.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   Now, you had to stay there.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   If you left before the death of the high priest,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   the avenger of blood can come and get you.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   But once the high priest has passed away,
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   you can then go down and you can live your life again.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   That's in Numbers 35.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   So what is the significance of that in the New Testament?
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   You think about the equal distance from the city, right?
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   We all have access to Christ now, all of us,
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   regardless of race, religion, age, or creed, we all have access to him.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   It was a city on a hill.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   Everybody could see it.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   This wasn't, you know, Lothlorien and Misty Wood.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   I mean, like, you know, you didn't have to, like,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   get out a map and go look for it.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   You knew, everyone knew where they were
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   because they were a city on a hill, right?
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   On top of that, you committed a sin that you didn't even know you committed.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   You're chopping wood and axing and flies off, kills some dude.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   You didn't know.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   But now you're made aware of it.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   I mean, it's a big deal, don't get me wrong, right?
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   But now you're made aware of it.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   Now you're unnoticed of it, right?
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   There's refuge for you.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   You humbly admit your sin.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   You sinned.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   You might not have meant to kill them, but you still killed them, right?
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   You could have used a different ax.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   You could have done something, right?
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   But you chose to use that ax.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   You were negligent, but there's still hope for you.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   There's still hope for you.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   What's interesting is that your life is intertwined with the high priest, right?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   So you go down before the death of the high priest, you're on your own, right?
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   And that's a clear picture of Christ.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   You go outside of Christ, you're on your own.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   You're on your own.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   The death of the high priest, obviously Jesus doesn't die.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   That was a pragmatic thing,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   but with respect to the symbolism involved.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   Can you mention something about the roads that led to the cities of refuge?
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   Oh, sorry. They were clear and they were paved.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   They were clear and they were paved.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   They were equal distance.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   Everyone could see it.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   Nothing else has gone on my mind.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   [laughter]
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   So all the best roads in Israel were the roads that led to the cities of refuge.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   Yes.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   All pointing to our way to Christ.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   Right.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   So in order to speed it up, let's try to give a condensed version.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   Okay. I'll truncate my answers.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   Okay.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   Give us a chronological order of the letters written in the New Testament
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   to the best of your ability,
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   understanding that there are some controversies as to some of the books,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   but to the best of your ability as you understand it,
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   a chronological order of how the books were written.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   [inaudible]
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   New Testament. Okay.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   Can you give them a little bit more condensed?
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   Just the Paul's epistles.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   You want me to write it all off?
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   I can write all of it off.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   Let's go.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   For the sake of time.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   Yeah, let's just limit it to the Paul's epistles.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   Can you do that?
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   Sure.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   Is that a little bit harder?
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   I still need to write it in my head. Okay.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   It will take the same amount of time,
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   but 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Galatians,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans,
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians,
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   1 Timothy, Titus, and then 2 Timothy.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   That's it.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   That's it. Yeah.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   That's it.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   He didn't write John.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   All right.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   Okay. Good.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   What is the role of the law in the Christian life in the new covenant?
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   And why is this important to the college student?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   Do you want me to answer as I'm speaking to college students, Pastor Peter?
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   Yes.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   Okay.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   Caleb, where are you at?
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   [Laughter]
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   I think it's tempting as a Christian because tempting to think of the law as less important than,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   let's say, the Gospels or the epistles of Paul.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   And the reason it's tempting to do that is because in our minds, well, it's fulfilled.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   Why would I want and why would I need to know something that's already been fulfilled?
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   The first thing I would say to that is the law is scripture.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   The law is scripture.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   And all scripture is profitable for correcting, reproof, teaching, training, and righteousness.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   It might not be in that order, but all scripture is profitable for that.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   Psalm 19, David says, "The law of the Lord is perfect,
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   converting the soul or reviving the soul, depending on which version you're using."
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   But before the New Testament is written, the psalmist is saying,
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting or reviving the soul."
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   Now, we might not normally think of the Ten Commandments as reviving my soul.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   But in 1 Peter 1, we're called to live holy.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   Also in Leviticus, obviously, but we're called to live holy.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   Well, what does that mean?
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   What does that exactly mean?
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   And you can see in the Book of Liberty.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   You can see that in the Book of Leviticus.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   You want to know about God's care for the—as we learned about today—
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   God's care for the widow, the orphan, the immigrant, the poor.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   Read Leviticus, but also read Deuteronomy.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   Read Deuteronomy 16 to 19 specifically. 19 to 26 as well.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   Also 16 to 19 specifically.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   You want to know about God's care for the temple, the church?
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   Read 12 to 16.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   You want to know how God's people should live.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   How important it is that the symbolism that we take to the rest of the world as Christians
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   is highly regarded, something by us should be highly regarded, because God values that.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   Read Deuteronomy. Leviticus as well.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   But study the Old Testament, and you'll see a picture of that.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   It doesn't mean much to say, "Well, live holy," but you have no idea what that means.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   Say, "Well, live holy." Okay.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   I'll give an example here.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   In India, the pastors, after they're converted, some of them continue to beat their wives.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   And now you and I might be like, "That's crazy. Why would you continue to beat your wife?"
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   That's not even the realm of thinking here.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   But because their culture is so steeped in that, in order to put their women in their place,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   in order to teach them, they beat them.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   Now, obviously, once you come to Christ, even before that, objectively you can't do that.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   But especially as a Christian, that's not something you can do.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   And instead of judging them, if you want to see God's care for all people, you study the law.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   If you want to see what God means by being holy, then you'll see it right there.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   That's, I guess, in summation what I would say.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   Okay.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   Okay, kind of a softball one here.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   Since we've been going through Leviticus, can you go ahead and go through the five major offerings
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   commanded in Leviticus and their significance?
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   Sure.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   We have the whole and the burnt, the grain and the meal, the Thanksgiving or the peace or the fellowship.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   I'm using those as AKAs.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:07.800]   We have the sin, and last we have the guilt, the trespass, the restitution, depending on how you say it.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   The sin or whole burnt offering is typically the offering that starts it up, so to speak.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   But the whole thing is burnt.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   Everything is given to the Lord.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   In the grain and meal offering--and that was a bull, ram, or dove.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   In the grain and meal offering, it was supposed to be seasoned without leaven and with some salt.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   In the fellowship offering, that was given when you want to make peace with your fellow man.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   And so that signifies peace with God and also peace with man.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   The sin offering, it was typically for unintentional sin you committed and then you made a wear off.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   And the restitution offering was the only offering that you could actually pay someone, and it was 1/5 or 20%.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   What you owe, obviously, on top of that 1/5 or 20%.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   So why are you certain that the 27 books of the New Testament is authoritative and final?
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   Answer as if you're answering a skeptic.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   College.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   Okay.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   This is going to take a little bit of time.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   I'll try to be fast.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   [laughter]
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   When you think about the New Testament documents, you think of documents from the ancient Near East thousands of years ago.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   How can they be true?
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   There was nothing digital back then, so how can we have faith that the New Testament documents are what they exactly are?
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   You can have faith for various reasons.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   Number one, now there are over 6,000 documents with respect to the New Testament.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   You said the New Testament, right?
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   Okay.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   With respect to the New Testament manuscripts, there were 6,000 documents that are within 99.5% corroboration.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   Now that 0.5% is scrivener error, meaning it's notes error that doesn't have any substantial change to the actual meaning of the text.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   Now, you might look at that and say, "Cool story," right?
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   But if I were to come to you, right, if I were to come to you, and I teach this in BCC, but if I were to come to you and ask you, "Did Homer write the Odyssey?"
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   You would say yes.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   Anyone would say yes.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   "Did Plato write the Republic?" Yes.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   "Did Homer write the Iliad?" Yes.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   There's never a time in high school when you read the Odyssey and the Iliad where you go, "Well, I got some scholarly concerns, AP English teacher," right?
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   We're not sure if Homer wrote the Odyssey.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   We're not sure if Homer wrote the Iliad.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   No one ever says that.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   It's accepted.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   It's accepted for good reason because there's copies of it, okay?
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   So if you have 6,000 for the New Testament, in second place, you have the Iliad.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   The count is 497.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   497, right?
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   So if you are a person who believes in logic, if you say, "Well, I believe Homer wrote the Iliad based on the number of manuscripts,"
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   then by definition, you must believe that Matthew wrote the Gospel according to Matthew, Mark wrote the Gospel according to Mark, and so on.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   Because the manuscripts are pale in comparison.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   The last thing I'll say is this because I want to truncate it, right?
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   Anytime you want a myth to develop, historians will tell you, anytime you want a myth to develop, it takes about two generations.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   The reason it takes two generations for a myth to develop is the following.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.800]   Let's say Shantang, right?
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.800]   We want to create this cult, right?
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   And in the cult, Shantang has wings, okay?
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   Shantang has wings, and we all made a blood pact.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   We're going to believe this.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   Shantang has wings, okay?
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.800]   We're going to go out, and we're all going to say, "Shantang has wings," okay?
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   That's never going to work, right?
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   The reason it's never going to work is because he's alive, right?
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   And the fact that he's alive, you can go and you can corroborate.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   You can go to Shantang, examine his back, "Take off your shirt, bro. Do you have wings?"
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   The dude doesn't have wings, right?
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   If you are removed two generations, if you are removed two generations,
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   you make a myth about something where all the people that can verify the claims are now deceased,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   then a myth can develop.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   Then a falsity can develop.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   But when you look at--and that's the majority--excuse me, that's all of the other religions, right?
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.800]   You go in a cave, and you found some wings.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.800]   You go here, and I found some book, right?
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   All by myself.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   All by myself about what happened hundreds or thousands of years ago.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   Christianity flourished in part because they said, "We saw the risen Christ.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   He was there. I ate with him. He's walking right there.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   The brothers are still alive. Go ask him.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   Whatever you say, I'm not going to deny it because I saw him."
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   This is the last thing I would say to a college student.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   If I had more time, I'd say more, but this is the last thing I'd say.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   Even for something that is true, you might not die for it, let alone a lie.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   If something's false, you're not going to die for something that's false.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   Someone put a gun to my head, "Does Shantang have wings?"
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   "No."
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   I'm not going to die for that.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   But let's say, for instance, he did have wings.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   Let's say it was true, and you put a gun to my head.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   I'm still not going to die for it because I don't want to die.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   That's the ultimate cross-examination.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   I don't want to die even if something is true.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   But the problem is Christianity flourished because it was true,
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   and people were willing to die for it.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   You're willing to die for something because it's true.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   That's the first prerequisite.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   You're not going to die for something that's false.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.800]   It must at least be true.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   And if it's true, you've got to be convicted of it.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   Actually, as a follow-up, thanks for all that.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   [laughter]
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   The 27 books that we have--
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   Abinations and Council of Carthage?
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   Yeah, why the 27?
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   Why couldn't it be more?
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   Why couldn't it be less?
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   Why is the 27 that we have--
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   are you certain that this is the final New Testament?
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   Okay, in Ephesians 2.20, the foundation was the apostles and the prophets.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   Apostles and prophets--prophets not being the Old Testament prophets.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   Apostles and prophets were the foundation of the New Testament.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   John 14, Jesus said before he leaves in the farewell discourse,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   he says, "I'm going to bring to mind things I told you."
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   The Holy Spirit will tell you.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.800]   John 16, he will bring to you all things regarding the truth.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   All things will come.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   Jude 3, the faith has been delivered once and for all for the saints.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   Once and for all.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   And to a little bit more attenuated degree, Revelation 22.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   Don't add or detract from it.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   And so when you look at the formation of the canon,
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   it was self-attesting, of course,
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   because it was promised that it was self-attesting.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   And just so, if you look at the New Testament books,
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   every single book was written by an apostle or someone with a close association to an apostle.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   There's only five books that were written not by apostles,
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   but with very close associations with them.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   And if we look at Athanasius' list, it's the ones we have today.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   If we look at the Council of Carthage in 397, it's the ones we have today.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   And the councils did not happen. That list didn't happen.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   Well, you know, let's get together, let's figure this out.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Those books were already confirmed, which is why at the Council of Carthage,
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   they said these are the books, because that's what was known.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   I can go into more detail, but I'm done.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.800]   All right, that's good.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.800]   Why is the doctrine of the Trinity so important?
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   Why do we consider it heresy to believe in modalism or tritheism?
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   The reason it's so important is because, number one, it's scripture.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.800]   So let me define Trinity first.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   God exists eternally as three persons, and God is one.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.800]   He exists eternally as three persons, but God is one.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.800]   Now, modalism and tritheism are on the opposite spectrums of that.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   I don't want to say in the middle, but scripture says three persons, yet one.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   Now, the dogma of the Trinity doesn't come because we don't like modalism or tritheism.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   It comes because the scripture says so.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   You look at Psalm 45, "Therefore God, your God."
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   What is he saying?
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   Genesis 1, "Let us make man in our image," Elohim, the plural form.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   It doesn't mean three gods, but it's the plural, "Let us make man in our image."
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   So already in the Old Testament, you see a picture of the Trinity, Isaiah 9.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   Isaiah 9 says, "His name will be Emmanuel, mighty God, everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.800]   Excuse me, "Wonderful Counselor."
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   "Wonderful Counselor, mighty God, everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   How can he be a wonderful counselor?
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   How can he be mighty God?
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.800]   And how can he be the Prince of Peace?
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   Psalm 110 says, "My Lord said to my Lord."
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   How is my Lord speaking to my Lord?
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   How is that going on?
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   And then when you come to the New Testament, you see something a little bit more specific.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   You see Jesus in the extended fire of discourse saying, "I'm going to go, and then you're going to see me."
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   How is he going to go, and how are you going to see him again?
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   How is Christ in us?
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   Colossians 1, Galatians 2.20, "I've been crucified, and Christ lives in me."
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   How is Christ living in me if he's ascended to the Father?
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   How can that be?
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   Unless the doctrine of the Trinity is actually true.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   Acts 5, "You have not lied to men, but to God."
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   It's talking about the Holy Spirit.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   So, number one reason it's heresy is because Scripture teaches the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   And I can go on about verses with respect to the Trinity.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   So, why is it so important that we get that right?
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   Outside of the fact that Scripture teaches it.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.800]   What is the ramification of getting that wrong?
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   Well, if you take modalism or tritheism.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   If you happen to believe in the doctrine of modalism, you say God appears in different forms.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   With respect to God appearing in different forms, at least in my mind, you have a Greek God.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   Someone who's fickle. Someone who just appears this way and appears a different way.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   If you believe in tritheism, Deuteronomy 6.4, the Lord God is not one. He is three.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   The Lord God cannot be one because he is three.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.800]   So, then now I'm a pantheist. Excuse me. I'm a polytheist. I'm a pantheist.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   I'm a polytheist now. I'm not a monotheist, right? I'm a pantheist.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   But in order to avoid a fickle Greek God and a polytheistic Egyptian God,
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   I believe in the Judeo-Christian God who is three yet one.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   Alright, good. What I was looking for is the way it affects how we understand the gospel.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   About justification, sanctification, glorification, our union with Christ.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   You don't need to get into all of that. Yeah.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   Oh, I can talk about that. Okay, I know you can.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   Yeah, but don't do it right now. Alright. Joe.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   Can you please go through the Psalms and the Messianic chapters and verses if you know of regarding...
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   Okay. I believe I know.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   Psalm 2a, God announced Christ to be his son.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   Psalm 8-6, God will put all things under his feet.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   Psalm 16-10, will not leave his son's shoulders, he will rise from the dead.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   22, 12-18, we see details of his crucifixion.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   34-20, all his bones will be intact.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   40, 48, Christ will come to do God's will.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   41-9, Christ will be betrayed by a friend.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   45-67, the throne will be eternal.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   68-18, he will ascend into heaven.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   109-8, the betrayer will be replaced.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   110-4, priests forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   And 118-26, he will come in the name of the Lord.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   You missed one, but it's okay.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.800]   It's 69, Christ will be given vinegar and wine.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   Oh yeah, 69. I'm sorry. 69-21.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   Good job.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   Are you holding up? Good.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.800]   I want to die, but...
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.800]   Alright.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   I'll give you a quick one.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   What is the difference between the feeding of the 5,000 in all the Gospels,
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   or not the Gospels, all the Gospels, and the feeding of the 4,000 only mentioned in Matthew and Mark?
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:59.800]   So, in the feeding of the 5,000, and in the feeding of the, sorry, in the feeding of the 4,000,
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.800]   one thing of note is the location.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:10.800]   In the feeding of the 5,000, it happens near the Sea of Galilee, the area of Bethsaida.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:17.800]   In the feeding of the 4,000, it happens near the area of the Gerasenes, around the region of the Copolis.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   In the feeding of the 5,000, you have five loaves, and after they are divided,
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.800]   there are 12 baskets left over.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   Five loaves, evocative of five books.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   Twelve loaves, evocative of twelve tribes.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   The area of Bethsaida primarily being Jewish.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:51.800]   In the 4,000, you have seven loaves, seven basketballs left over,
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   seven being evocative of creation, completion,
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:04.800]   that area being evocative of non-Jewish believers, or Jewish to mixed Jewish believers.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   And so, you see a picture of God not only coming for the Jews, but also coming for the Gentiles.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   Okay, we're going to go back to the Old Testament.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   So, can you kind of walk us through the split of the kingdom of Israel and Judah into two,
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   and who the kings were that were involved in that split,
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:37.800]   and can you also explain the sin of the Israelite king who initiated this split,
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:46.800]   and the after effects of his leadership, and what the Old Testament refers to as a great wrong?
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   So, the sin that you're referring to is the sin of Jeroboam.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   I'll start backwards. It's the sin of Jeroboam.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:57.800]   Now, with respect to Rehoboam and Jeroboam, you see the split happening in 1 Kings 12.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   Now, before that, just to give a truncated example, there was always been Eminy,
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.800]   because going back to Rachel and Leah, right?
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   And then you see the tribe of Benjamin almost being wiped out at the latter portion of Judges.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   You fast forward a little bit, David had a tough time with the Benjamites, right?
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   But he ultimately united them.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.800]   That was fractured when you see Absalom take over.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.800]   But once again, you have, at least prior to that, a united kingdom,
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   Rehoboam being Solomon's son, right?
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   And in 1 Kings 11, Ahijah the prophet goes to Jeroboam and says,
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.800]   "Look, I'm going to give you the tent, right?
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   I'm going to give you the tent, and the reason is because they were unfaithful."
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   That's essentially the reason given in 1 Kings 11, right?
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   So, Solomon hears about this, he tries to kill Jeroboam,
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   he flees to Egypt, after the death of Solomon, he comes back,
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.800]   he goes to Rehoboam, he demands a lighter tax burden,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:56.800]   because, like his father, he was heavily taxing the nation of Israel.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   So, obviously, they weren't pleased with that.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   That's the political backdrop, so to speak.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.800]   Obviously, we know that that's not the only thing because of 1 Kings 11.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:12.800]   But, Jeroboam then takes ten, all the tribes besides Benjamin Judah,
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   goes up north, sets up a system of worship in Dan and in Bethel.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   And when he sets up a worship between Dan and Bethel,
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.800]   he sets up the golden calves, and says,
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   "These are the gods that brought you out of Egypt."
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   So, number one, you have a difference of location.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   They are no longer going to pilgrimage to Judah.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:38.800]   Can you explain why he did that, why he set up those locations?
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   To consolidate power.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.800]   To ultimately consolidate power. I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.800]   Yeah, basically, because he didn't want the people to go to Jerusalem
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   to basically worship and then turn back to Rehoboam, correct?
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   Right. Sorry. Yeah. I wasn't sure.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   Right. Okay.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.800]   Yeah. Which letter has the most extensive use of the Old Testament, and why?
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:02.800]   Okay.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.800]   In the New Testament.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.800]   Okay. So, I just need clarification on this.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   So, when you say "letter," obviously you don't mean "gospels," correct?
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.800]   You said "letter."
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   Gospel. You couldn't include the gospel.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   Okay. So, and when you say "extensive use," I mean, quotes, allusions,
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   I mean, you know, it becomes difficult.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   So, let me just answer this question.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   You're guilty. All right.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   Revelation has maybe 240, 30, depending on how you count, the quotes are allusions, right?
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.800]   Romans and Hebrews obviously has anywhere between 80 and 90,
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   depending on how you count the quotes or allusions.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.800]   Matthew has somewhere between 90 and 100, depending on how you count the quotes or allusions.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   The book of Matthew is primarily showing Jesus as the Messiah,
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   so for that reason he's going to quote the Old Testament extensively.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:55.800]   In the book of Romans, you have the backdrop of it, Jewish Christians being exiled,
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   now they're coming back, so Paul has to speak to them,
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.800]   "How are you going to get together? Let me give you an exhaustive treatment of the gospel."
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.800]   So, he goes through the entire gospel, right?
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.800]   And Romans 4 is obviously noteworthy because it explains the life of Abraham.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   Hebrews, obviously, because you have Jewish Christians, right,
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   who have experienced hardship, but they want to turn back into Judaism,
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.800]   or tended to turn back into Judaism, right?
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   So, in order to have the author of Hebrews encourage these Jewish Christians not to turn back,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.800]   he's using presupposed authority to teach them why they shouldn't turn back.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   Instead of using New Testament scripture, he's using Old Testament scripture,
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.800]   which they already presuppose as authority to encourage them not to turn back.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:43.800]   Revelation, because you have a ton with respect to the Messianic kingdom all throughout the prophets.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.800]   Truncated version, right?
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.800]   Alright, so we're going to wrap up this portion of it.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   If you have one more question, you can ask, okay?
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.800]   Something that's not going to take 15 minutes.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   Okay? So, one question.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   Yeah, I have a question that's going to take like an hour, so we'll skip that.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   Just can you go ahead and identify the pre-exile, exile, and post-exile prophets?
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.800]   Just list them out.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   That's probably...
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   Sure. Pre-exile, well, Jeremiah's pre-exile, because he's kind of in, he survived both.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.800]   But with respect to Jeremiah being in those both new camps,
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   you have Isaiah, and then Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Abbaqit, Zephaniah being pre-exile.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.800]   And then post-exilic, you have everyone else, which is...
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   Exilic first.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:42.800]   Excuse me. Exilic first. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and then post-exilic, Haggai, Zechariah, and then Malachi,
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.800]   which will cover all the prophets.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   One more question.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.800]   Quick question.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.800]   Did I not say Jonah?
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   What was the significance of the transfiguration?
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   Short answer.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.800]   All right. Short answer.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   Moses and Elijah, you see Jesus in his glory, right?
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:08.800]   And then you say God, you hear God say, "Listen to him."
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.800]   So you have the representative from the law, the representative from the prophets,
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.800]   but Jesus is the one being glorified, and you send God saying, "Don't listen to Moses. Don't listen to Elijah. Listen to Christ."
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.800]   And later on, they would find encouragement from this.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:28.800]   John 1, we have seen his glory. 2 Peter 1, we have seen his glory. We heard it from the mountain.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   And it fueled them and encouraged them, but also showed Christ as God's son.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   Okay.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.800]   Sorry, I can go.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   All right. Yeah.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   So we can go on and on, and we know, again, the purpose of this is to kind of test him, to make sure that he did his homework,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   and I guess we could stay here three, four hours or more the rest of the day and to keep testing him.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   But again, I think he did a great job doing that.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:01.800]   But I want to ask some more personal questions concerning the eldership.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   What's a doctrinal position? Again, you don't have to go into the details of it.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   Just tell us, what's a doctrinal position that you changed within the last five to ten years, if there are any?
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   If you say you didn't, then?
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.800]   Okay, five to ten years. I'm trying to think how old I am. So 28 to now.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   Okay. It doesn't have to be precise. Yeah.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   It could be 11. It could be four.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   All right.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   Okay.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:42.800]   I think the major doctrinal shift that I had that's most noteworthy to me is my shift on Romans 7.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   There was a period in my time where I found the research of theological positions quite interesting,
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   and this was when I was living with Pastor Aaron, Brandon Wong, and some other guy no one here knows.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   But I came to the conclusion that Romans 7 was talking about a Christian who was struggling.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   Through my time in studying the last year, specifically for this elders exam,
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   I had a chance to really take a bird's eye view of scripture.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   And I'm not saying therefore I'm right. That's not what I'm saying. I'm giving you my personal testimony.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.800]   I had a chance to look at a bird's eye view of scripture.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   And now, obviously because of the exam, I have to memorize. I'm committing things to memory.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   I don't think anyone would have been impressed if I came up here and said, "Hold on. Let me Google this real quick."
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:51.800]   So as I was committing things to memory, one thing I noticed about Romans 7 that I had to concede—
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   can I explain the shift as well, Pastor Peter?
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   In a minute, if you can.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800]   In a minute, okay.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.800]   If I believe that Romans 7 is talking about a Christian,
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   then I have to believe that that's the only place in the scripture where a Christian is described in that way.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   In every other portion of scripture, the Christian and the Holy Spirit is described as victorious.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:21.800]   You see that when Jesus comes on the scene, and then he is making the deaf hear, the blind see, the lame walk, and he's raising Lazarus.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.800]   And then in every other portion of scripture, we are commanded to obey.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   How can that be if Romans 7 is talking about a struggling Christian?
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:39.800]   And right before that, right before the last part of Romans 7, he's talking about the law and the spirit.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   It sounds like, at least in my opinion after reading it now and studying it,
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:48.800]   it sounds like he's talking about a faithful Old Testament Jew who doesn't have the spirit.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.800]   But now we have the spirit in Romans 8. Therefore, there's no condemnation in Christ.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:58.800]   That's the biggest major shift that I can think of, which I'm truncating.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:05.800]   What is a doctrinal position that you have difference in with the current leaders?
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.800]   Not all of us or one of us or two of us.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.800]   Okay.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:23.800]   I am currently as I stand, I am somewhere between, depending on what day you ask me, I guess, what day of the year, what day of the week you ask me.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.800]   Tuesday.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.800]   I am somewhere between 51, but over 50.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:38.800]   I am somewhere between 51 and 75 percent confident that Christians will be raptured pre-tribulation.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.800]   That the tribulation will be pre and not post or mid.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.800]   All right. Prove it.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.800]   Okay. All right. Anything else?
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   Besides the tribulation?
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.800]   Yeah. What other positions or?
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:04.800]   The only other one I could think of is infant salvation, but I'm not.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.800]   I don't have a strong position on that.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.800]   That's the only one that comes to my mind, but I'm not over 50 on that.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   I'm like. I'm like 48 and then 52 and then 36.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.800]   I'm kind of all over the place.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   Okay. You're very good.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:28.800]   That's the only thing I can think of.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   Okay.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.800]   Yeah. Maybe there. I'm 99 percent sure there's nothing else.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.800]   99 percent. So what is that one percent that you're not sure?
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   I can't think of anything else.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   Okay. All right.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.800]   Okay. This is a bit more personal.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.800]   What is something that you are concerned about?
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   If we confirm you as an elder in the church, as you examine yourself,
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   you know, in the ears and conversations that we have,
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:24.800]   what's a concern that you have of yourself becoming an elder in the church?
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:37.800]   I think that if I am indeed confirmed, I will inevitably,
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   and I'm using that word intentionally,
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   I will inevitably do something or say something that I highly regret,
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   that would be unbecoming of an elder.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.800]   I don't see Joe or Phillip ever doing that.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.800]   Joe or Phillip would never do something like that.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   I mean, anything is possible, but Joe or Phillip would never.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   Joe and Phillip, they are steady.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:16.800]   They are. They can't be shaken.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:27.800]   My bet is that I will do something or say something that is unbecoming of an elder.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.800]   I'm not talking about doctrinal truth.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:37.800]   I am not speaking about standing up for what is right.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:48.800]   I am talking about the next day saying to myself, "Why did I do or why did I say that?"
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:58.800]   That is what I think will—I know that doesn't inspire a lot of confidence,
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.800]   but I think it's inevitable that I will do that.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   If you're asking an honest question, I will give you an honest answer.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   Scripture also says that an elder must rule without compulsion, right?
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.800]   To do it because he desires to do it.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.800]   He who seeks to be an elder seeks a noble task.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:37.800]   Why do you desire to be an elder?
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:45.800]   If you had asked me, "Do I want to be an elder at the age of—what's the youngest number?
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.800]   28, 30, 31 maybe, 32 even maybe?"
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:57.800]   I would have said to myself, "This is God's calling for me. I need to do this. I need to do this."
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:06.800]   As I've gotten older and I have been made more aware of the various sins in my life
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:16.800]   and the things that I am weak to, I began to value anonymity a lot more.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:23.800]   The reason I value anonymity is because when you're anonymous, you don't hurt people.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.800]   You don't damage people.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.800]   You also don't have as much responsibility.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:35.800]   So when you serve, no one's going to say, "Well, he's serving because he's an elder," or whatever else.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:42.800]   The reason I'm bringing this up is because there's a huge part of me that I know that if indeed I am confirmed,
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.800]   that I will lose that.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.800]   There was a period when I was just doing cleanup, and I would lock up.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.800]   After I would lock up, I knew why I served.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.800]   There was no one there looking at me.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.800]   I knew that my heart was pure. I knew.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.800]   I knew at that moment, "I'm doing this for God."
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:10.800]   Going forward, I don't know if I will know if everything I—
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   a part of that will be taken from me, I feel like.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:22.800]   I had so cherished that, especially when I come to value that later on in life.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.800]   Now, you're asking me why. It sounds like I don't want to be an officer.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.800]   Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to ask you.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   I know, but let me answer that question. Sorry, Pastor Peter.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.800]   You're asking me a lot of questions.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.800]   I struggled with that after I was approached, because that's how I felt.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.800]   That's the place that I was in. That's the place that I was in.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.800]   There's a couple reasons, and I'll give the straight human reason.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.800]   You asked me, and I thought to myself, "Am I really going to say no to you?"
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.800]   That's the first thought. "Am I really going to say no?"
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.800]   Because if I am going to say no, then just say no now.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   Secondarily, I didn't want—well, you asked me, and I'm like, "No, no, no."
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.800]   You asked me, "No, no, no." I'm not going to do that.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.800]   I say yes, or I say no. That's what's going to happen.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.800]   The human thought I had was, "Am I really going to say no to Pastor Peter?"
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.800]   The second thought I had was, "Is God calling me to do this?"
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   It was very, very bottom line.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.800]   Because if He's calling me to do this, then I have to do this.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.800]   Moses saying, "I'll send someone else. I can't speak," that's not humility.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.800]   That's disobedience.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.800]   We might think it's humility, but it's not.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.800]   I had that thought in my mind.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.800]   Don't mix you wanting to be irresponsible, you wanting to be lazy, with humility.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.800]   Humility is not laziness or irresponsibility.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.800]   Humility is quite different. Humility answers the call.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.800]   The bottom line question I had for myself was, "Is God calling me to do this?"
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.800]   If He's calling me to do this, then I want to do it.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.800]   I don't know if that makes any sense, but that was my thought process.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:12.800]   Okay. All right. Thank you, James.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.800]   That's the test portion of it, and I think we are more than satisfied with the answers.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   Again, like you said, we can sit here and test him through all of that,
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.800]   and we can testify that James put more than enough time.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.800]   He's been studying the whole year, and we could have waited a little bit longer,
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:34.800]   but we wanted to put him out of his misery, get him back to his wife, have a normal life.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:40.800]   The process now from this point on is we're going to take some time to, again,
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   allow the church to respond.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.800]   From now until early, maybe we're shooting for somewhere around February or March,
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:52.800]   before we finally confirm him and install him into the church,
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   we're going to give the church an opportunity to respond,
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.800]   and not to mumble in the background, "Hey, I have this concern," or this, this, to bring it up.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.800]   If you think that we have blind spots that we are not seeing in James,
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.800]   that we want you to take the opportunity to come to us.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   Come to us in private, tell us these are our concerns, have you considered it,
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.800]   and we want to try to do our best to answer your questions.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   So we're not presenting him blindly.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.800]   We're not telling you that we know better than everybody else in the church.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:27.800]   I've personally wanted James to be on board because I felt that he would add,
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.800]   and he would add to our eldership.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   I don't think there's any question of his passion for the Lord, his love for the church.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.800]   I've personally observed him for over a decade.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.800]   We've all seen him from college and mature and married life, and again, as a DA.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.800]   But one of the things that I just, this is more of a personal thing.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.800]   You know, when I turned 50, you know, I started thinking about next generation.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.800]   It just, it wasn't just by choice, it was just, you know, that's just the kind of process you go through.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:05.800]   And I'm thinking the next, you know, I don't know when, when that would happen.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.800]   That may happen in my 60s, it might happen in my 70s,
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.800]   but at some point the elders in the church have to take charge of transition.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.800]   And as I was thinking that, we need, I felt the need for somebody
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.800]   who is going to be able to articulate the doctrine, articulate the position,
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:27.800]   and maybe even to a certain degree to fight for the things that we need in the church.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.800]   And so, as I was thinking through these things, I mean, James, to me,
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.800]   you know, has been that guy already in the church for many, many years.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:42.800]   And so, again, the reason why I wanted him to join the eldership is because at some point,
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.800]   whether that's five years, ten years down the line,
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.800]   that, again, and I'm not saying that I have these thoughts in my mind,
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:56.800]   but at some point we don't want to wait until I'm right there and something happens and then we're not ready.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:04.800]   And so the elders who are installed and, you know, running the church needs to be able to be strong enough,
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.800]   you know, let's say even if I was not here, and to be able to transition
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.800]   and to be able to handle that at some point, whether that's ten years, 15, 20 years from now.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:18.800]   And so, James, I thought, would be a great person to have on board.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.800]   And one of the things that we talked about is, it's really important to us,
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.800]   is we have qualifications of character, and as I've mentioned it to you already,
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:32.800]   a lot of the things that you've mentioned in the confirmation, we've talked to,
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.800]   James is more aware of it, nothing that you've brought up has surprised us because we knew it already.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.800]   And James is the first person to know throughout the years that I've talked with him, met with him,
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.800]   that was the primary thing that we've talked about all these years.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   And if we weren't confident that there has been progress and this is not going to be a hindrance, right,
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.800]   we all have flaws.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.800]   And nobody, like, perfectly above reproach.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.800]   We all have flaws that, by the grace of God, covers.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:06.800]   But, you know, we want somebody who's going to be able to not only just kind of go along with whatever we're doing,
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.800]   but who's going to be able to speak up and say, "Hey, I'm not sure if I see that in Scripture.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.800]   I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do. I'm not sure if that's a doctrinal position.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.800]   I'm not sure if that person is the right person for that position."
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.800]   And so James would be a great person to add for that purpose.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:27.800]   And so, again, along with all the other qualifications,
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:36.800]   we want to make sure that this is somebody that loves us, right, and that we love him.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:43.800]   And so it's in the context of where, even in disagreements, it's a disagreement between brothers.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.800]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.800]   I have the nastiest fights with my real brother, right?
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.800]   But at the end of the day, we're brothers.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.800]   It's a fight between brothers.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.800]   So there are often times where we're in the meeting and we'll have sharp disagreements.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   And sometimes, you know, if I disagree with something, my voice naturally elevates.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   And so, and same thing with James, you know.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.800]   Like, our voices tend to elevate.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   But we want to make sure that when these things happen, when we're struggling and fighting together,
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   that it's in the context of brothers.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.800]   That we never question that we have our best interests.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   And secondly, we want to make sure that whoever's on leadership loves the church.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   That they would sacrifice their reputation before the church.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.800]   And I've seen this throughout the years, where you have elders who are great,
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.800]   and they're doing a great job, and then they get offended, and then they just burn the church down.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.800]   You know, because they're more concerned about their reputation than they are for the church.
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.800]   And so, that's something that, again, I'm encouraged with James.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.800]   James loves the church.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.800]   He would pack up his bag and do something else before he does that.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.800]   And I'm confident that he loves the church sacrificially.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.800]   And so, those are qualifications beyond what I see in scripture that we want to make sure that we have.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.800]   And so, that's the reason why we started this process.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   And again, you know, we're trying to find wisdom in how to best involve you as a church.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.800]   Where we're not just saying, "Hey, just trust us. We're smart."
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   You know, we prayed about it.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.800]   So, again, we're going to take this time until the confirmation, until February or March,
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:27.800]   from now until then, if you really feel that these are things that I think are going to disqualify him,
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.800]   that's the time. That's the time to bring it up.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:36.800]   Otherwise, we're hoping that sometime early next year, we'll have a confirmation installation service.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:37.800]   Okay?
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.800]   All right. Thanks, James.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   You can breathe. You can breathe. Take off your tie.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800]   [Applause]
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.800]   Okay.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.800]   [Applause]
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.800]   And, you know, one of the things, okay, you guys can head down.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.800]   Yeah, one of the things that I asked, even before I even asked James, was,
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.800]   and Diane doesn't even know, but I was, I actually kind of talked to Diane.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.800]   Diane doesn't know that I was actually poking.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:11.800]   And to see what kind of influence James was having at home.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.800]   And if Diane said at that time, and Diane had no idea that I was thinking about this.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.800]   If Diane said at that time, it's like, man, you know, I'm having a hard time with James at home.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.800]   I have a hard time respecting him.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:25.800]   If he just kind of said that, you know, I probably would have pulled back and said,
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.800]   we're going to have to wait.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.800]   But Diane's answer is like, man, like, I really respect James.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.800]   And she's been, like, spiritually impacted.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:38.800]   And, again, Esther knows, Esther, you know, when she was meeting up with Diane.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:44.800]   And so we can all confirm that his public life and home life is consistent.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:49.800]   And so that's part of the reason why I felt comfortable proceeding and asking him to do that.
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:55.800]   Again, but now I'm asking you guys to take the initiative if there is something that you really feel concerned.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:00.800]   Because not simply because you have something against him, but because you love the church.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800]   And we want to protect the church.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   We want to establish the church.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.800]   And we need, we're asking you if there are certain things, just take that time.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.800]   Email, we'll meet with you in private.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.800]   And if there are certain things that we need to hear or talk to you about,
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.640]   or talk to you about, we'll take some time to do that
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.400]   before we move on to the next part, okay?
