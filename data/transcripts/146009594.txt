[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.320]   All right.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.840]   Okay, so let's take a look at our passes tonight.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.840]   We'll pray and then we'll jump in, okay?
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.340]   Let's take a look at our passes for tonight here.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.240]   Let's see, it says in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.680]   And it reads, "But in giving this instruction,
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.840]   "I do not praise you, because you come together
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.300]   "not for the better, but for the worse.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.000]   "For in the first place, when you come together as a church,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.160]   "I hear that divisions exist among you,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.680]   "and in part, I believe it.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.540]   "For there must also be fractions among you,
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.100]   "so that those who are approved
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.160]   "may become evident among you.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.620]   "Therefore, when you meet together,
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.000]   "it is not to eat the Lord's supper,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.720]   "for in your eating, each one takes his own supper first.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.100]   "The one is hungry and another is drunk.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.200]   "What?
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.840]   "Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink?
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.460]   "Or do you despise the church of God
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.860]   "and shame those who have nothing?
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.280]   "What shall I say to you?
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.580]   "Shall I praise you?
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.080]   "In this, I will not praise you.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.760]   "For I receive from the Lord
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.540]   "that which I delivered also to you.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.760]   "The Lord Jesus in the night
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.920]   "in which he was betrayed took bread,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.220]   "and when he had given thanks,
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.220]   "he broke it and said, 'This is my body,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.540]   "'which is for you.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.520]   "'Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.100]   "In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.520]   "saying, 'This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.280]   "'Do this as often as you drink in remembrance of me.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.920]   "'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.640]   "'you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.480]   "'Therefore, whoever eats the bread
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.140]   "'or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.280]   "'shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.360]   "'But a man must examine himself,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.260]   "'and in so doing, he is to eat of the bread
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.560]   "'and drink of the cup.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.720]   "'For he who eats and drinks,
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.640]   "'eats and drinks judgment to himself
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.960]   "'if he does not judge the body rightly.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.760]   "'For this reason, many among you are weak and sick
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.660]   "'and a number asleep.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.040]   "'But if we judge ourselves rightly,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.320]   "'we would not be judged.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.140]   "'But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.160]   "'so that we will not be condemned along with the world.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.860]   "'So then, my brethren,
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.660]   "'when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.040]   "'If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.700]   "'so that you will not come together for judgment.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.240]   "'The remaining matters I'll arrange when I come.'"
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.000]   All right, let's take a moment to pray
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.480]   and ask for the Lord's blessing on our study tonight.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.160]   Father God, I thank you so much for your grace.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.360]   I thank you, God, that again,
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.080]   we have the privilege of coming together.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960]   I pray for every single one of us.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.680]   If there's any of us who are feeling weak or tired
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.440]   from the weeks, I pray, God, that you would strengthen us.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   Lord, I pray that you, through your spirit,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   would continue to empower us to persevere
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.600]   through the busy weeks, persevere through our own fatigue.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.120]   I also pray, God, that you would continue to inspire us.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.040]   Lord, as you, through your scripture,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.320]   show us what it means to live for the sake of your glory,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.680]   live also in a way that is pleasing
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.360]   and honoring to you in the church.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.960]   I pray, God, that we would be inspired.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.440]   Okay, so I hope you guys had good discussion in your tables.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.560]   The first section that we wanna cover
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.460]   is verse 17 through 22.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.200]   And in looking at this passage, I ask you this question.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   Apostle Paul is obviously displeased, to say the least.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.160]   And he says, "I will not praise you," okay?
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.040]   "Because you come together not for the better,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.880]   "but for the worse."
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   And then he repeats it later on in verse 22.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.560]   In this, "I will not praise you."
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   So I see that as a little section.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.200]   Now my, I guess, activity or the warmup
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.640]   that I had you guys do is try to list
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.240]   some of the problems and sin in this passage.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.320]   Circle the words and phrases and identify the problem, okay?
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.240]   So real quick, can some of you guys just throw out,
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.640]   again, it's just observation,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.920]   so throw out the various sins and problems that you see.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.080]   - Divisions exist.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.560]   - Divisions exist.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.880]   - Drunkenness.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.080]   - Drunkenness.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.320]   - Drunkenness.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.120]   - What else do you guys see?
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.640]   People just running and getting a bunch first.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.480]   - They come with the wrong motives.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.160]   - Coming with the wrong motives.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.760]   What else?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.360]   Okay, shaming those who have nothing, shaming the poor.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.660]   What else do you guys see?
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.120]   That's pretty good.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.040]   Pretty good list we have working there.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.400]   Now if you were to take those multiple things
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.360]   he's mentioning, saying, "Oh, you guys are doing this
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.800]   "and you guys are doing that,"
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.440]   and you try to hone in on,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.680]   is there perhaps a summary term
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.600]   or at least a focal point to which he's getting at
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.120]   when he sees this problem in the church?
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.280]   What do you guys think?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.440]   (silence)
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:18.080]   What was that?
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.920]   - Selfishness.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.040]   - Selfishness, okay.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.880]   Interesting.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.920]   Yeah, there's definitely a whole lot of selfishness there
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.680]   when you see the people going out and getting things first,
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.000]   thinking of themselves, and he's like,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.720]   "Man, if you wanted just to do things for yourself,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.240]   "couldn't you do it at home?"
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.640]   (clears throat)
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.720]   But for me, that's not, I guess,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.840]   that's definitely an element in there,
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.480]   which I guess you could say even a cause of it,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.400]   but there is a big problem that he sees
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   as a major problem in this scenario.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.500]   What is that problem?
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.680]   - Having no reverence for the Lord's Supper.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.160]   - Okay, having no reverence for the Lord's Supper.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.420]   Good.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.840]   Let's jot down a few.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.200]   I have on your packet,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.680]   let's see here.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:14.480]   Two major, I guess, lines.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.600]   Okay, two major lines for that.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.840]   And the first line,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.480]   can you guys put what Alex had mentioned,
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.760]   that there is irreverence?
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.160]   That there is irreverence.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.000]   So, in one way, you can look at all the stuff
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.480]   that they're doing, whether it be like,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.320]   all you guys are getting drunk,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.840]   or some of you guys are running down the aisle.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.680]   It's pretty hilarious.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.800]   I told you guys, I think I shared a story one time
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.240]   about my first experience with communion,
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.480]   and this was hilarious, because I went with my buddy,
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.600]   and we weren't Christian at the time,
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.440]   and back when I was at that church,
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.760]   we were in youth group, and this was my,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.080]   I think, end of junior year in high school.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.400]   The way that we did communion at that time
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.360]   was essentially, everybody would line up,
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.920]   the pastor at the front would hold a huge loaf,
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.240]   and then another pastor would hold a cup.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.440]   Well, what's funny is, you take,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.400]   the pastor breaks the piece of bread for you,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.760]   and then you're supposed to dip it in the cup,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.240]   and you're supposed to eat it.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.960]   Well, I just remember, because of the scene,
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.880]   the both of us, as soon as the pastor said,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.720]   "Hey, we're opening up the communion, now come down,"
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.840]   we just ran.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.400]   Boof, we came running down.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.280]   Mainly it was 'cause we were bored out of our minds,
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.760]   and we were hungry.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.440]   We came running down, and then the guy in front of me,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.280]   he went first, he grabbed it, he dipped it, he ate it,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.440]   but I wasn't paying attention,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.320]   'cause I was a little nervous, too.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.560]   And what I did was, I just grabbed the bread and ate it,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.160]   and I got to the cup, and I was like, "What do I do?"
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   So I just grabbed the cup,
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.920]   and I tried to drink it like this,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   and the pastor shoved my hand out of the way,
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.000]   and said, "What are you doing?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.320]   "Just go, just go," and I was like, "Oh."
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.240]   He just got rejected from my first communion.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.800]   It was pretty hilarious.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.360]   But I do remember taking that communion
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.840]   with a kind of a sense, like a ignorance,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.920]   a sense of just naive, like we're just kids,
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.720]   just doing whatever, you know?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.560]   Just a little bit.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.920]   (laughs)
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.080]   And there's a sense in which,
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.040]   the reason why I tell that story is because
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.520]   you could maybe read this as saying,
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.960]   "Hey, the people are acting like fools.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.460]   "They're acting naive, they're acting like kids.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.000]   "You know, it's kind of like a bunch of kids
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.240]   "running to the dinner table, some of them are first,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.860]   "they're just selfish," which they are, which is true.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.240]   He says it.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.320]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.120]   all that points to a greater problem,
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.440]   in that there is irreverence.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.240]   When you look at that term in verse 17,
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.880]   for they come together, not for the better,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   but for the worse, that word for the worse in Greek,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.240]   is a word that represents moral wickedness, okay?
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.480]   Moral wickedness.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.240]   And so as he's thinking about this,
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.120]   yes, he's talking about selfish indulgence,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.840]   shaming the brother, et cetera,
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.440]   but there's a sense in which
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.000]   the people are scandalizing the church,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.200]   because there is wickedness and irreverence
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.320]   for that which is holy in the church, okay?
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.020]   So the first major problem that he's seeing here
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.520]   is not simply, "Man, you guys just are a mess.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.720]   "Every time you guys have communion,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.420]   "you guys are just unorganized,
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.800]   "and you guys are just selfish,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.040]   "you guys are a bunch of kids."
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.160]   That's one way to look at it.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.800]   The other way to look at it is,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.520]   you guys are irreverent, right?
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.040]   So that's what's happening here.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.040]   Now, the second thing, as I guess almost a result of that,
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.520]   you notice from the entire passage that we read,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.240]   there is another problem, like a big problem,
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.800]   that almost concludes from that, which is?
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:50.360]   Divisions, okay?
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.840]   So the second blank really played in divisions.
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.460]   Divisions, yeah.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.840]   So if you were to read chapter 11,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.880]   and then you go all the way to chapter 14,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.720]   and you read the whole thing,
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.340]   you're gonna find that Apostle Paul
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.880]   takes it upon himself to talk about division in the church
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.760]   with an emphatic tone of,
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.320]   "We cannot have division as a body of Christ."
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.660]   And if you remember back even from chapter one,
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.440]   Apostle Paul desired us to be of the same mind.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.920]   Apostle Paul desired us to be united, right?
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.800]   What's very interesting is when he says in the passage,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.860]   for that in the first place,
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.340]   when you come together as a church,
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.400]   I hear that divisions exist among you.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.680]   And he says, "I believe it."
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.760]   The rest of the verse almost shows
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.080]   why Apostle Paul believes that there are divisions.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.720]   He sends the thing, "Look at the division.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.240]   "I believe it, I see it, here it is."
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.280]   And so he sees as a major problem
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.520]   the division that's taking place in the church.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.320]   And really, what's interesting about it too,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.440]   is he uses descriptive words,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.680]   because the term for division is schismata,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.080]   which means tearing or cutting apart, okay?
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.720]   And I just want you guys to think about it a little bit.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   He says in this verse,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.980]   "You guys are coming together as a church."
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.820]   And for those of you guys who are in BCC class,
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.920]   what does the church, or what is the church?
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:40.480]   Or, what?
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.540]   - I think Ed said body of Christ.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.140]   - Okay, good.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.140]   It is the body of Christ.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.580]   And the Greek term for that,
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.580]   that we cover in BCC class, ekklesia,
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.020]   which means those who are called out, right?
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.060]   And that, but just more formally speaking,
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.460]   is the assemblies, those who are unified
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.060]   by the fact that they're called out by God and for God.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.060]   And so he's saying, "You guys, by nature, are the church,
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.020]   "and you're coming together as a church,
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.020]   "but then there's divisions among you."
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.460]   And so Apostle Paul is making a huge point here
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.920]   that this, again, is not a small problem, but a big one.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.180]   So, in thinking about this for a moment here,
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.240]   I want us to,
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:30.500]   I guess, take a moment to think about the church
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.980]   and the divisions that exist, all right?
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.680]   And then I'm gonna introduce an interesting thought, okay?
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.860]   So right now I'm making the point
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.140]   that the church and Corinth, they're digressing,
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.980]   they are broken in many ways,
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.980]   they are divided, and there's irreverence for the Lord, okay?
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:54.300]   In verse 19, he makes an interesting statement.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.320]   He says, "For there must also be fractions among you,
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.900]   "so that those who are approved by,
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.760]   "so that those who are approved
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.420]   "may become evident among you."
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.860]   And here is an interpretive challenge for us,
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.900]   because I'm making the point, look how bad it's going.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.760]   The church is in a horrible state.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.820]   They're irreverent towards God, and there's fractions.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.980]   But then, in verse 19, it reads,
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.060]   "For there must also be fractions among you,"
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.340]   almost like saying, this is just how it is.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.140]   Or is that really what he is saying?
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.740]   So, let's do a little exercise here.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.300]   And I want you guys to look at the passage,
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.460]   and let's observe some of the phrases that are there, okay?
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.980]   First,
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   we realize that there's that term,
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.400]   you know, where there's a for there,
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.080]   and then we ask, like, what does the for do?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.160]   It connects with the previous thought.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.700]   He says there's these divisions among them,
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.240]   which, again, as a church, there shouldn't be.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.760]   But then he says, "I believe it."
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.440]   So perhaps this, again, this verse in verse 19,
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.680]   is just connecting that Apostle Paul
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.500]   believes there's fraction because of this, right?
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.640]   But then, there's that word, must.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.160]   Must.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.540]   And there's a question as to, what does he mean by must?
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.480]   Now, in some of your other translations,
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.760]   like the NIV translation, he says,
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.060]   "No doubt there have been differences among you."
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.920]   Kind of like saying, huh, I believe it,
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.920]   'cause I just assumed.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.620]   So is he kind of saying, like,
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.440]   oh, there must be divisions among you,
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.840]   saying, like, of course there are, you're human,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.760]   no doubt, everybody knows that, you know,
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.720]   there's gonna be divisions.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.040]   What is he saying?
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.000]   What's a possible interpretation of this verse?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.640]   But then we notice that there is a purpose clause,
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.160]   in order, okay, in order, which shows purpose,
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.960]   and it says, "Those who are approved
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.240]   "may be evident among you."
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.760]   Interesting.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.280]   So here's my question to you now.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.480]   I list for you several possibilities
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.000]   that I've seen in different commentaries.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.040]   The first one, is he giving a statement of reality?
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.700]   Hey, division is unavoidable.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.200]   Where there are people, you're gonna have drama.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.960]   And where there is drama, you're gonna have people
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.880]   who don't like each other,
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.880]   and there's gonna be divisions.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.280]   Or is he sarcastically saying,
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.640]   I heard there's division, and I believe it,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.520]   because look at y'all, you know,
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.280]   he's kind of sarcastically saying something.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.040]   Is this a statement that division is a natural cause
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.360]   of men trying to stand out?
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.840]   So that interpretation takes a focus on
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.160]   men who are approved wanting to be evident?
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.040]   Is this an issue where people want to become evident,
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.000]   so as they're competing with each other,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   of course there's divisions?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.640]   Or letter E, the division exists so that the truth
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.660]   about the spiritual nature of men would be known.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.600]   What do you guys think is a proper interpretation
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.840]   of that verse?
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.080]   - Four.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.120]   - You like number four?
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.200]   - The division exists so that the truth
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.760]   about the spiritual nature of men would be known.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.840]   - Okay, interesting, and why do you like that one?
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.480]   - Because as you said, he gives the purpose,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.520]   there's an outcome of these divisions,
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.680]   and the outcome is that those who are genuine
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   among you may be recognized.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.520]   - Gotcha.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   - And so, I mean I think he's saying
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:48.760]   that the church is a mixture of people who are genuine
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.440]   and people who are not genuine, the weak and the terror.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.760]   And there has to be a separation,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.160]   there'll still be some mixture until the end,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.520]   but there will be divisions that separate some of them.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.480]   - Right, okay.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.400]   Okay, good.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.800]   So David is focusing on the second part of the verse
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.160]   to help us interpret the verse appropriately, right?
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.080]   So, which is a good practice to,
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.220]   so sometimes certain things help us to understand it
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.920]   because of what it says.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.920]   So yeah, I agree in the sense that
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.960]   that latter half of the verse tells you a purpose
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.440]   of why he's saying that statement of,
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.360]   hey, there must be divisions.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.040]   And if you read it again and again,
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.760]   it's kind of hard to tell if you just think of like,
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.060]   I wonder how he's saying these things,
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.800]   but if you focus on the purpose, I agree.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.520]   That this passage is not saying like,
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.560]   hey, what can we do, or like,
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.360]   so what I'm saying is,
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.800]   I kind of don't like the NIV translation of that.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.000]   It's like, hey, no doubt, of course, you know?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.840]   I think more so along the lines,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.840]   it is this idea that in a church that's striving for unity,
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.840]   there is still going to be division, okay?
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.880]   And so, let's talk about that a little bit,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.240]   and let's think about that.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.600]   And I'm not sure if I'm doing the best job
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.160]   explaining this, okay?
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.920]   Church should be united,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.520]   and the fact that there is division is bad, okay?
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.240]   But then the statement we have is,
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.840]   there is division, there must be.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.240]   And then there is a greater purpose
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.840]   that God uses that vision, the division,
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   which is to essentially make it apparent
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.400]   as to the spiritual condition of men, right?
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.080]   And from that, I think there's something to be learned.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.160]   I think, for me, when I think about that,
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.900]   and so I want your gears to go,
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.480]   what can be learned from something like that?
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.740]   I think about sometimes how I react to divisive people, okay?
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.720]   I think about how I react to divisive people,
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.280]   and there's a sense in which the existence
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.000]   of that element of whether it be immaturity, wickedness,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.360]   is an opportunity for the church to grow
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.120]   and show itself to be strong.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.920]   What I'm saying is, I get kinda convicted by that passage
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.760]   as I'm thinking about that,
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.320]   because how I react to that spiritual individual,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.400]   if I see a divisive person and I say,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.680]   "Ugh, that guy is this and that,"
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.600]   and then I go like clamber and I go do all this stuff,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.640]   spiritually speaking, what it exposed
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.880]   was that spiritually, I'm weak too.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.760]   And I think there's something to be learned from that
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.860]   is because there are people who, yes,
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.400]   want to strive for unity, holiness,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.220]   and sanctification in the church,
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.280]   but somebody who sees the greater picture
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.040]   should recognize that in that struggle,
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.280]   the division, the heartache, and sometimes the pain
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.660]   of wrestling with those things exist.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.660]   I think, for me, as a young guy,
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.720]   sometimes I'm like, "Ugh, why is there a drama?"
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.800]   And you just get frustrated.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.620]   You just get frustrated.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.620]   Sometimes, again, in a, I don't know,
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.360]   a sense of immaturity, we see the unspiritual,
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.400]   and then through our anger or frustration,
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.120]   we try to rectify the thing,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.040]   which again causes greater division.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.320]   Sometimes in our immaturity,
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.080]   we might look at something like this,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.760]   where it's talking about the communion,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.320]   it's talking about the Lord's Supper,
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.240]   how come you guys come running over like you're hungry?
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.480]   What are you doing?
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.440]   And how come you guys aren't thinking about the poor?
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.640]   What are you doing?
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.720]   Forget this!
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.200]   I don't wanna be a part of this!
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.100]   Is that more spiritual, to see the problem,
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.520]   and then say, "Let's destroy it?"
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.280]   No, it is not.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.000]   And that's what I'm talking about when I say,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.320]   "Let's take a moment to think about it
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.620]   "and learn a principle here."
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:49.620]   Divisions exist, and temptation and causes of division exist.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.600]   It's an opportunity God uses to show us
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.480]   the spiritual makeup of the church.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.060]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.680]   So, in seeing this first section,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.480]   Apostle Paul addresses the major problems,
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.720]   the irreverence and the kind of wickedness that's brewing.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.820]   He sees the schism, the division
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.660]   that's occurring in the church,
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.680]   but then he also shows that in the context of all things,
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.560]   God is still using that scenario, okay?
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.740]   Any questions about that?
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.480]   Okay.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.080]   Then, let's look at the second part of it,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.800]   verse 23 to 26.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.620]   Oh.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.960]   I left a big blank next to the title
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.640]   because it's good practice for you to try to summarize that,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.640]   try to encapsulate that somehow
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.720]   into a short little phrase or a sentence.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.440]   And you guys can just do that, you know?
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.160]   I'll leave that for you to do.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.920]   (pages rustling)
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.920]   Okay.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.980]   Let's take a look at verse 23 to 26.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.120]   And it says, "For I received from the Lord
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.340]   "that which I also delivered to you,
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.120]   "that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.880]   "he was betrayed, took bread.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.820]   "And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.620]   "This is my body, which is for you.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.780]   "Do this in remembrance of me.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.460]   "In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.800]   "saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.640]   "'Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.540]   "'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.400]   "'you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'"
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.040]   Okay?
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.200]   My question to you that I had you guys discuss was,
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.200]   from this passage, what is the purpose of the communion?
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.360]   Why don't you guys share what you guys discussed?
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.120]   (pages rustling)
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:59.300]   - To remember Christ.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.560]   - To remember Christ.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.340]   Okay, so in one of your big blanks,
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.080]   that's right, to remember Christ.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.140]   I find it so, I guess, encouraging.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.280]   I think God recognizes we are forgetful people.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.400]   He set into the pattern of our worship,
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.360]   a pattern of our regular practice of church,
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.520]   and the gathering of people that we break bread
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.400]   and remember Christ, okay?
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.120]   And the thing about it is God knowing mankind so well,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.560]   he did this long ago as well.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.880]   Can you guys turn your Bibles to Exodus chapter 12,
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.040]   verses 11 through 13?
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.920]   (pages rustling)
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.480]   In Exodus chapter 12,
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:48.840]   is the inauguration of the great, great feast,
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.400]   the thing to be remembered for the generations to come,
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.880]   which is called the Passover, okay?
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.300]   And if I could just have one of you guys
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.660]   please read verses 11 through 13,
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.480]   we'll take a look at the Passover as a memorial
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.680]   that God installed for the people, okay?
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.960]   So, let's see, can I have,
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.920]   Jarena, can you read verse 11 through 13, please?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.680]   - In this manner you shall eat it,
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.960]   with your bell-tossing,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.520]   and with all your tea and your saffron and your milk,
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.160]   and you shall eat it in peace.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.920]   It is the Lord's Passover,
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.800]   for I will pass your land and keep it,
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.880]   but may I have the choice of all the firstborns
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.080]   and their offspring,
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.440]   both man and beast,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.200]   and of all the gods and people of the earth,
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.680]   and of the Christ and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.200]   And I am the Lord,
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.360]   and the blood shall be as mine,
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.240]   and the life of the world shall be as mine.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   - Okay, thank, oh, go ahead.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.720]   You have, did you read all of verse 13 already?
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.640]   - No. - Okay, go ahead.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.560]   - So when I see the blood, I will pass it over to you,
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.080]   and no plague will befall you,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.160]   until you show your face,
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.080]   and when the fire strikes,
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.920]   the land will be yours.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.960]   - All right, thank you, okay.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.440]   So as you read that verse,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.960]   I wanna recall to your memories what's happening in Egypt.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.360]   Remember that the people of God
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.560]   are enslaved and oppressed for 400 years.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.840]   They're beaten, they're killed,
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.880]   they're put to work carrying the heavy stones of Pharaoh,
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.700]   and then they cry out to God,
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.120]   and God hears their prayer.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.680]   And so God starts to judge the Egyptians,
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.240]   and then he starts to bring down miraculous plagues,
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.640]   everything from cutting off their water source
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.000]   and making it into blood,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.320]   their animals dying,
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.720]   their livestock dying,
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.800]   boils and sores,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.840]   and they're in pain.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.320]   Hail is falling from the sky.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.400]   Gnats are everywhere.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.920]   All this kind of stuff is happening,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.080]   and in the 10th plague,
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.920]   they say, and God says,
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.720]   I'm going to kill the firstborn.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.840]   An angel of death is gonna come through.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.500]   What always struck me about that passage is,
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.380]   I asked the question,
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.480]   is God judging Egypt?
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.320]   Then why in the world is God's people
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.600]   having to cover their houses with blood?
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.000]   And it reminds us,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.460]   it's not just Egyptians that are being judged by God.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.680]   It reminds us that the wrath of God is upon everyone.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.480]   It's upon everyone.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.520]   That even the people who are there in Egypt
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.500]   deserve to die in that same way, okay?
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.280]   Now in thinking about that,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.360]   God installed this Passover feast
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.320]   where it's an incredible drama.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.400]   You have the whole family gathered together,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.880]   and everybody is dressed.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.220]   When you guys come home after a long day at work,
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.360]   the dress shoes come off,
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.360]   you get into your basketball shirts on,
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.020]   and then you eat dinner in front of the TV
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.360]   or talking to your family.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.920]   Whatever it may be.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.240]   But here he says, put on your shoes,
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.720]   put on, gird up your loins, take your staff,
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.820]   don't even make the bread arise.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.920]   Make the bread flat.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.120]   Eat it in haste.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.080]   It's kind of like, okay, everybody gather together.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.880]   Everybody comes on the table, ready to eat.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.720]   Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   It's like, what's going on?
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.880]   God was trying to teach them,
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.280]   you too are in danger of judgment.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.560]   And what needs to happen is you need to escape.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.880]   But your only way of escape is to have the blood cover you.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.640]   And when the blood covers your household,
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.600]   then the angel of death will pass over you.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.000]   What an amazing picture.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.880]   And so, I just want you guys to jot this down,
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.640]   that this meal of the Passover was a very dramatic scene.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.680]   And what would happen in Jesus' time,
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.360]   and in the times of, again,
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.260]   the Old Testament saints and whatnot,
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.420]   the head of the house, the host of the ceremony,
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.040]   would pronounce blessing over the meal,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.300]   and they would have four different cups of wine.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.460]   The first cup of wine,
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.520]   he would pronounce just simply the blessing,
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.880]   and then he would pass it around to everybody.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.520]   And after the first cup was taken
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.080]   by everybody who was present,
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.160]   they would eat bitter herbs dipped in the fruit sauce,
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.340]   and as they're eating,
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.780]   the host would start to give a message.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.920]   Turn in your, as you are in Exodus chapter 12,
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.680]   go over to verse 14,
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.880]   because this is how God presents this.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.040]   In verse 14, it says,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.480]   "Now this day will be a memorial to you,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.200]   and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the Lord.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.780]   Throughout your generations,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.440]   you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance."
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.040]   And then go to verse 24 through 28.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.720]   And if I could have, let's see, Randall,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.880]   can you read for us verse 24 to 28, chapter 12 of Exodus?
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:32.580]   (Randall speaking faintly)
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.080]   (Randall speaking faintly)
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.540]   (Randall speaking faintly)
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.040]   (Randall speaking faintly)
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.620]   Great, thank you.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.060]   And so, what would happen is,
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.220]   after the host of the family
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.980]   would remember this whole thing,
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.140]   and he would give a message as to,
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.140]   "What in the world are we doing with this ceremony?
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.120]   What is the meaning of this?"
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.300]   And he would talk about how the fact
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.460]   that God spared us in Egypt,
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.980]   that God passed over us because of the sacrifice of the Lord.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.760]   And then after he would do that,
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.620]   they would take part in the next cup,
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.580]   and as they were doing that,
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.820]   they would sing what's called the halal,
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.300]   which literally means praise.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.180]   It's related to the word hallelujah.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.700]   Okay, so the spelling in the front part of hallelujah,
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.740]   that little song that they would sing would be the halal.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.380]   And it essentially comes from Psalm 113 through 118.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.020]   And after they start singing the beginning portion
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.340]   of this song, they would take the bread, break it,
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.900]   and then each person would eat,
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.420]   and then it'd pass around the third cup.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.540]   And then after the third cup is passed around,
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.740]   the host, or the head of the home, would bless everybody,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.020]   and then they would take a fourth cup,
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.300]   and the fourth cup is to celebrate the coming
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.100]   of the kingdom, and they would drink to this.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.820]   I sometimes wonder, you know, like,
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.800]   if you think about the drama of that whole celebration,
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.500]   I mean, it's pretty involved.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.620]   That's a pretty long, like, series of things to do,
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.500]   and that's a lot to think about.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.820]   And there's a sense in which that ceremony,
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.780]   even in the Old Testament, as their Passover,
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.880]   it was supposed to be a celebration.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.060]   And then I sometimes think about this question,
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:48.060]   why, perhaps for some of us, that celebratory aspect
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.340]   of the communion or what we partake in is not there?
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.540]   It's because I wonder.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.740]   I wonder if we feel that same sense of, like,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.260]   oh my goodness, God passed over me.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.180]   I deserve to be judged, I deserve to die there in Egypt,
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.780]   I deserve to either be left there as a slave,
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.420]   die in the devices of the pagans and the enemies of God,
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.020]   or I myself deserve to die by the angel of death.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.580]   But God passed over me.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.340]   Hallelujah, right?
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.940]   Hallelujah.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.060]   And so it's supposed to signify for the people of God
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.780]   that kind of deliverance, a supreme deliverance
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.780]   by the mighty hand of God through miracles,
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.980]   through his power, delivered from that
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.260]   which there was no way to escape except for blood.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.100]   Okay?
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.020]   And then Jesus Christ, in the moment
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.900]   when he's sharing this meal with his disciples,
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.580]   he essentially, as the host,
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.980]   the head of the disciples there,
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.700]   he is instituting this dinner,
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.180]   he's presiding over this ceremony,
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.020]   and that's when Jesus Christ, in taking the cup,
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.520]   in Luke chapter 22, verse 19 to 20,
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.360]   he starts to give it a full,
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.320]   a fulfillment of exactly what it's supposed to represent.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.520]   The shadow was there, Christ explains
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.480]   what it's supposed to represent.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.320]   And so, that whole act of taking the bread,
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.000]   that whole act of taking the cup of the blood,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.240]   we are supposed to remember.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.800]   Just like the Old Testament saints
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.400]   were supposed to remember, we are to remember.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.760]   It's not just an issue of calling back facts.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.000]   God has instituted this ordinance
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.240]   that we practice in our day of the communion,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.920]   that we might relive it, that it might affect us,
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.300]   that we might be just engrossed in this idea.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.960]   God has passed over me through the blood of Christ.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.080]   Right?
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.880]   So remember everything about Christ.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.800]   Remember that he came to be flesh.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.560]   Remember his work of healing and ministry of teaching.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.760]   Remember the work of sacrifice on the cross
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.740]   and the suffering.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.420]   Remember him for all that he is.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.320]   And the Lord's Supper for us, the communion,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.800]   celebrates the permanent and spiritual victory
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.240]   that is the ultimate deliverance from God's wrath.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.600]   Okay?
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.560]   That's what we're supposed to remember.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.780]   So, from thinking about all that,
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.440]   we can see why Apostle Paul is quite upset
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   as the way they're approaching the communion.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.360]   But before we move on, there is an element of the communion
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.200]   that I think that is sometimes overseen.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.680]   What is the second purpose or another purpose
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.800]   that you see about the communion?
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:44.600]   Okay, so there's memory of the new covenant is blood.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.420]   Good.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.240]   So, I'm gonna wrap that up together with remembering.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.080]   Remembering the sacrifice, remembering the new covenant.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:53.920]   Okay?
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.520]   And there's an element in simply just remembering
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.720]   all that Christ has done and his promises to us.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.040]   So, very good.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.480]   But what's another aspect of the purpose of the communion?
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.100]   Yes.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.960]   Proclamation.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.920]   Proclamation.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.360]   Okay.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.880]   So, the second blank there is proclamation.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.440]   And if you look at the passage,
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.480]   (clears throat)
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.280]   here, he mentions this starting from verse 26.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.160]   Says, "For as often as you eat this bread
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.560]   "and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.360]   "until he comes."
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.320]   And there's, just in that short little phrase,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.720]   there's an aspect of two things.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   One, you're proclaiming his death on the cross,
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.200]   that you are not ashamed of it,
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.680]   that you are caught up in it, that you're identified by that.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.360]   But then he says, "You proclaim that until his coming."
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.320]   So, there's an aspect of looking forward,
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.400]   the proclamation of his coming.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.600]   Right?
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.640]   And the reason why that's important is because
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.040]   for you guys who've been here at Berean long enough,
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.080]   you know very well that we do not,
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.720]   we tell people that you need to be somebody
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.920]   who has genuinely surrendered to Christ,
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.960]   received the Lord, and that you proclaim his name.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.880]   Because that's what you do when you take part in that.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.920]   In remembering, in taking a part,
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.800]   you are participating in that fellowship of communion,
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.480]   you are proclaiming also, this is what I believe.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.560]   You're proclaiming to not just the congregation,
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.680]   but anybody who would see that.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:35.640]   This is the one whom we trust and believe, okay?
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.720]   So, those are the purposes that we see for the communion.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:44.680]   So again, given that, that communion was supposed to be
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.680]   by the design of God, a remembrance for the saints.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.800]   And by the design of God, this was supposed to be
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.880]   a proclamation of his truth,
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:55.960]   you can see why Apostle Paul is sitting here saying,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.880]   "How irreverent of you guys."
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.440]   You can see why Apostle Paul is saying,
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.920]   "Look at this ordinance and all that it represents,
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.360]   "what are you doing?"
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.340]   Right?
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.920]   So, let's tackle the last segment.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.840]   Okay, and I have Diane.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.280]   Can you please read verse 27 through 34?
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:18.440]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.360]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.280]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.200]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.120]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.640]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.680]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.600]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.680]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.160]   (distant speaking)
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:37:02.680]   Okay, cool.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.080]   So, for your table discussions,
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.160]   I asked kind of a really broad question.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.340]   And I asked from verses 17 through 34,
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.200]   but we're focusing right now on verses 27 and down to 34.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.720]   What do you think is the main exhortation to the church
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.840]   in this passage that we're studying?
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.560]   And then I asked, how do you think we can apply?
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.000]   So, can some of you guys share,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.160]   what do you think is the main exhortation,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.240]   and how can we apply?
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.180]   How about somebody from that table there?
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.100]   You guys.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.320]   (distant speaking)
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.160]   Examine yourself, okay?
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.560]   So, remember, I typically always go through
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.880]   and I underline or I try to take note of every major verb.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.940]   And he flat out says, you must examine yourself.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.440]   If you are to eat of this communion,
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.160]   if you're supposed to partake of this, examine yourself.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.520]   Okay?
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.840]   And what I'd like you to do, just for a moment,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.620]   is, you know, as you hear that exhortation,
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.300]   I do wanna ask the question, how do you apply that?
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.780]   Right?
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.140]   How do you apply, first and foremost,
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.340]   something like, hey, examine yourself,
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.620]   check yourself, you know?
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.180]   What do you guys think?
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.740]   'Cause, hey, examine yourself, to me,
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.780]   doesn't feel the same as like, just read your Bible.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.540]   It's like, okay.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.380]   You know?
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.560]   (distant speaking)
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.520]   Yes?
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.800]   - Pray like, the best you're supposed to.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.280]   - Good.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.820]   I don't know, again, how regularly.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.760]   I feel like sometimes I pray for certain needs.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.720]   I always pray for strength, I pray for perseverance,
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.080]   but I don't know how many, you know,
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.720]   how often I sit and just say, hey,
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.380]   God, I just wanna take a moment.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.720]   Can you help me examine myself?
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.140]   'Cause it's a little awkward, too.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.780]   I find that sometimes it's hard to pray those prayers
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.640]   where I'm actually interacting with God.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.460]   There's a sense that it's easier to pray
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.780]   in terms of letting God know what's going on,
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.380]   and then asking Him to give me something,
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.860]   and then I'm done, as opposed to almost anticipating
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.220]   a response from the Lord.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.300]   God, what are things in my life?
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.700]   And if you remember, there's a lot of passages like this.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.360]   Can you jot some of these down?
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.480]   Psalm 139, 23, 24.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.280]   Psalm 139, 23, 24.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.200]   This is one that you guys have probably heard a lot.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.400]   Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.000]   Try me and know my anxious thoughts,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.920]   and see if there be any hurtful way in me,
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.720]   and lead me in the everlasting way.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.480]   That's a pretty powerful passage.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.840]   Psalm 26, verse two.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.880]   Psalm 26, verse two.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.720]   Examine me, O Lord, and try me.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.960]   I don't know if those words hit you a little bit, but
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.220]   to be able to say those words honestly before God
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.380]   is quite an unnerving thing.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.480]   God, test me, right?
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.360]   Put me to the test.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   He says, test my mind and my heart, he says.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.600]   Job, Job is actually quite a righteous man in the Bible.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.640]   Righteous as we can say righteous.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.960]   But in Job, chapter 13, verse 23,
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.960]   chapter 13, verse 23, he says,
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.280]   how many are my iniquities and sins?
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.240]   Make known to me my rebellion and my sin, O Lord.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.080]   Finally, Galatians, chapter six, verse four.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.840]   But each one of you must examine his own work,
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.640]   and then he will have reason for boasting
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.460]   in regard to himself alone, not in regard to another.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.880]   So, lately I feel like there's been
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.080]   a lot of talk about discipleship,
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.280]   and the need for some personal disciple
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.440]   to come into your life and tell you everything that's wrong.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.600]   Which can be very, very helpful if your heart desires it,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.680]   and the other person who's the discipler
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.160]   who wants to do that, okay?
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.120]   But there is also a sense in which
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.840]   this passage is challenging us, right?
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.760]   The passage straight up reads,
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.320]   you need to examine yourself.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.720]   And that needs to be something that we first begin
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.000]   with a hard attitude, a hard attitude that's open,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.320]   a hard attitude that says, I want to make sure
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.080]   that those things to which I need to change,
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.760]   those things which I need to grow,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.480]   is a conviction from my own personal discovery.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.600]   It's a conviction that I've had from examining myself,
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.040]   and then seeing where I need to go with the Lord, right?
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.360]   And I think that's, again, something that's valuable
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.040]   for every single one of us to do.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.520]   Okay, so very good.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.560]   Thank you, Franny, for mentioning that.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.960]   But here's another question.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.640]   What else do you guys see as, when I ask the question,
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.680]   what is the main exhortation, and how can it be applied?
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.920]   There is another exhortation that he's giving,
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.000]   but it's not as direct as, hey, examine yourself.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.360]   But from the rest of the passages that you see
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.920]   from verse 27 to 34, what do you see as another exhortation?
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:37.000]   - Care for the church.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.040]   - Care for the church, very good.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.640]   He does talk about caring for the church,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.800]   and I'm gonna say that is a exhortation
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.520]   that's gonna be a running theme from chapter 11
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.560]   all the way to chapter 14, okay?
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.480]   So very good, 'cause that's in there.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.320]   But there's another exhortation that I see
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.660]   more specific simply to this paragraph.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.600]   Any ideas?
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.240]   - Wait for each other.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.280]   - Wait for each other, good.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.120]   So as an application, he starts saying,
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.480]   wait for each other.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.960]   What does he say at the very end of it?
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.480]   He says, wait for another, if someone's hungry,
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.700]   let 'em eat at home, and he gives
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.200]   all these applications, right?
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.120]   I am looking, sometimes I ask questions
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.480]   where I'm looking for a specific answer.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.640]   Sorry, I'm doing that right now.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.760]   It's not good for open-ended stuff,
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.520]   but let me lead you to that, okay?
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.720]   Earlier we began with me asking you,
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.120]   what is a major problem that Apostle Paul sees
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.600]   in this church?
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.080]   And the first answer was, what?
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.840]   (laughing)
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.680]   That's so funny.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.800]   He second-guessed you, okay.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.920]   What's the first blank you guys have filled
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.640]   as the first problem that you see?
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.800]   What was that?
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.240]   Irreverence, okay?
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.640]   So then, thinking about it, what do you think
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.240]   is the application, or what do you think is the exhortation?
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:08.360]   Chen?
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.280]   - Everyone else says irreverence.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.600]   - Everyone else says, don't be so afraid
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.840]   to be wrong, dude.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.120]   Remember, I lay down easy.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:18.960]   What?
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:23.640]   Oh, okay, just being modest, huh?
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.160]   All right, that's cool.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.480]   Well, think about that for a moment,
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.560]   because if you notice what's happening
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   in the passage, look at verse 27 through 34,
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.440]   and then he starts talking about, okay,
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.200]   if whoever eats the bread and drinks the cup
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.560]   of the Lord in an unworthy manner,
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.920]   when you think of something like that,
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.080]   that's a broad category.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.960]   Like, what does he mean by unworthy?
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.240]   And if I were to ask you, in this context,
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.080]   what are they doing that's an unworthy manner?
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.160]   You should start filling those in a little bit.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.440]   And then he says, shall be guilty of the body
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.080]   of the blood of the Lord.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.240]   Okay, what does he mean by guilty of the body
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.200]   and the blood of the Lord?
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.080]   And he says, he must examine himself.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.400]   Okay, so that was exhortation.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.520]   You need to examine yourself, you need to test yourself.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.720]   And then he starts giving this, in verse 29,
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.600]   this idea of for, okay?
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.400]   So, you need to examine yourself why.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.840]   For, he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.080]   to himself if he does not judge the body rightly.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.480]   For this reason, many among you are weak,
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.040]   sick, and a number asleep.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.640]   If I were to categorize this rationale, okay,
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.160]   therefore, whoever eats in an unworthy manner is guilty.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.320]   And then, so, but a man must examine himself
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.240]   because if you eat and drink like this,
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.400]   there will be judgment.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.680]   Because if you eat and drink like this,
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.920]   there are many of you who are weak, sick, and dying.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.420]   Right?
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.680]   Those, to me, are consequences of your actions.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.520]   Right?
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:01.760]   So, not only should you just simply take your relevant,
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.340]   sorry, reverently,
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   you need to take this incredibly seriously
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.440]   to the degree that you recognize the consequences
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.960]   of your actions when it comes to the Lord's table.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.240]   Right?
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.280]   So, yes, one exhortation is you need to examine yourself,
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.880]   but the other exhortation simply is you need
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.760]   to take this seriously and with reverence.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.520]   Because of what it stands for, because what's happening.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:32.080]   Did you know that for many years,
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.640]   the Supreme Court had debated about,
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.520]   is it illegal to trample on the American flag?
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.900]   To burn it, to whatnot.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.840]   And for a huge chunk of time, they kept debating about it.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.200]   Back in like, you know, 1880 something,
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.960]   they started the debate.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.640]   1907, they said, oh, we shouldn't, you know,
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.720]   we shouldn't like forbid it because what would happen
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.280]   is some people were burning the Confederate flag.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.280]   And they're like, ah, we can understand why.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.200]   And so they decided to make it not illegal.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.480]   But then 20 years later, they made it illegal.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.780]   And it stood illegal for a long, long time
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.600]   until a liberal group essentially said,
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.120]   hey, we have the freedom of speech.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.260]   So around 1987, they decided, hey, it's not constitutional.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.600]   You can burn flags now.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:19.920]   But why would the Supreme Court battle, go back and forth,
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.080]   to make it illegal to take a piece of cloth and then burn it?
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.320]   Because of what it represents, right?
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.120]   Because of what it represents.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.760]   To come to the church, which is the representation
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.120]   of the body of Christ, and then to come to the church,
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.360]   to the communion table, which is the representation
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.920]   of what Christ has done, and the proclamation
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.200]   of him coming and his kingdom coming,
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.760]   and then to approach it with a reverence,
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.360]   Apostle Paul says, do you not understand?
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:51.840]   There are clear and severe consequences to that.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.260]   There's gonna be the chastisement of God.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.680]   There's gonna be judgment.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.960]   And some of you are seeing it now.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.900]   You're weak, you're sleeping.
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.680]   Sleeping is a euphemism for some of them are dying.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.200]   And if that boggles your mind, it should.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.120]   It's a what?
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:08.960]   In the church?
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.780]   Are they Christian?
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.440]   Yeah, I do believe those people who were put to death
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.880]   for their irreverent behavior in the church were Christians.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.720]   But there's a sense in which they experienced
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.560]   the ultimate chastisement in this life,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.680]   which is to end it, okay?
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.600]   That's what I believe.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.240]   But just think about that for a moment.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.560]   If the communion represented the cross of Christ,
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.760]   what would we be doing if we just approached it
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.160]   with a sense of like, man, who cares?
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:44.940]   If you turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 10,
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:49.940]   verse 28, 29, there's a, I don't know,
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.760]   very sobering, I guess is the best way to put it,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.760]   very sobering passage.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.720]   Hebrews chapter 10, verse 28 and 29.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:08.380]   Huh, 28 and 29.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:14.640]   Because the author of Hebrews is trying to show us
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.680]   severity by making a comparison.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.520]   In verse 28, he says, "Anyone who has set aside
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.840]   "the law of Moses dies without mercy
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.440]   "on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.960]   So this is exactly how it happened in terms of judgment
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.480]   in the Old Testament against the law of Moses.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.760]   Verse 29, "How much severer punishment
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.520]   "do you think he will deserve
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.080]   "who has trampled underfoot the Son of God
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.620]   "and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:46.880]   "by which he has sanctified
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.120]   "and has insulted the spirit of grace?"
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.440]   I don't know why if many, you know,
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.840]   it somehow gets into our head.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.960]   Because we are in the New Testament,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.200]   because we have Jesus Christ,
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.280]   because we have the Holy Spirit,
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.120]   because we have the church
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.720]   and because we have the promises of God,
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.440]   for some reason, sin is less severe.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.620]   But that's not the rationale of the Bible.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:13.740]   That's not the rationale of the Bible.
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.040]   Because we have the Holy Spirit,
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:15.920]   because we have the church,
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.000]   because we have the sacrifice of Christ,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.300]   because we have the blood of the perfect Lamb,
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.560]   sin is actually even more severe.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.000]   That's the logic of the Bible, right?
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.600]   And so again, Apostle Paul,
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:35.000]   in the exhortation I believe from this passage,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.920]   as we think about the problems in the church,
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.520]   you know, what unworthy manner is he thinking about?
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.240]   It could include, some of you guys are just doing this
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.040]   out of ritual, some of you guys are coming in this
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.080]   out of selfishness.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.680]   You see this as an opportunity to, you know,
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.000]   pompously come up first, eat all you can
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.600]   and leave scraps for the poor.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.840]   Some of them, maybe spiritual pride and arrogance
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.440]   for recognition, whatever it may have been.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.680]   Some of them, they just don't believe.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.520]   They just come up and like,
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.200]   "Huh, I guess we're doing this today.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.480]   "I don't believe it, but whatever."
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.840]   What, I don't know, right?
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.560]   I can only imagine what he's trying to say
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.920]   by unworthy manner.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.840]   But Apostle Paul is being very clear.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.840]   This is a sacred ordinance by Christ
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.160]   that I have received from the Lord
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.160]   and I deliver it to you.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.280]   Take it seriously.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.680]   Take the church seriously.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.840]   Take the consequences seriously.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.200]   And that's a sobering encouragement to us, okay?
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.400]   All right, any questions about this passage
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.760]   on the section that we studied today?
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.040]   Okay.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   You got a question?
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.280]   (laughing)
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.120]   - Just a comment.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.640]   Just, you know, there's always like the,
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:50.280]   people say, you know, you're causing division
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   because of your different doctrines, you know?
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.600]   Like, who cares about that stuff?
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.080]   Divisive, you know?
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.400]   And like, so I think, yeah, I think this is,
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.040]   and then they'll bring up this verse, you know?
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.800]   They'll bring up this passage.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.240]   And I don't know about, like,
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.000]   I want to hear what your view is.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.880]   Like, you know, like this is like division,
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.120]   you know, in a very petty way.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.120]   It doesn't seem like it's division over important things.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:23.080]   It seems like it's just division over just pettiness,
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.280]   you know, he had mentioned all this stuff
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.680]   in the church and fighting.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:32.920]   What is your, you know, when people bring up, you know,
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.680]   like different doctrines and doctrinal views,
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.880]   and there is division.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.360]   Division is caused, right?
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.760]   I wouldn't say that that is people,
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.600]   I mean, that's just logical, right?
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.880]   You believe something differently.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.480]   - Yeah.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.320]   So if I--
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.600]   - It just applies to that.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.280]   - Okay, so if I understand your question,
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.720]   you're saying sometimes there are people
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.800]   with different doctrines, like, different beliefs,
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.160]   and different doctrinal points, and they bring it up.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.720]   Are you saying, like, are you just asking me,
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.000]   is that divisive?
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.960]   - Well, yeah, I mean, in my case,
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.640]   I'm the one that causes division, let's say.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.680]   And 'cause I'll bring up, like, certain views, you know,
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.400]   and there'll be division, you know?
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.520]   I've had, like, some negative feedback, right?
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.360]   - Sure.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.640]   - That's divisive, you know?
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.680]   - Okay.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:23.320]   - Would you say that's a bad kind of division?
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.880]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.720]   So--
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.560]   - Regardless of my--
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.400]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.120]   - My temper or my attitude.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.280]   - Okay.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.080]   Well, the thing about it is,
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.760]   to conclude, hey, something is divisive,
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.400]   and something is not,
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.360]   obviously, you have to have careful,
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.480]   you have to exercise caution with that.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.320]   Because, for example, there are cases
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.880]   when people act out of ignorance.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.400]   There are sometimes cases in which people
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.640]   just are talking, you know?
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.280]   And there is place for theological discussion,
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.480]   and there is place for differences,
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.680]   with even within the church, okay?
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.720]   Which, later passages is gonna talk about.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.760]   There's a lot of differences in something like that.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:05.800]   But there is always a question of why we do certain things.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.680]   What's our goal, what's our aim, right?
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.360]   Sometimes you can be engaged in a theological discussion
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.000]   because you truly are hungry, not simply for truth,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   but you're truly hungry for the truth of God.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.560]   You're hungry for God.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.960]   You want to follow him, so you're asking questions.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.960]   Good.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.720]   That person is very different from saying,
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.200]   I'm right, I know, you don't.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.640]   Let's fight.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.880]   Divisive.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.880]   The attitude of the heart matters greatly.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.240]   And so the attitude of the heart,
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.080]   when an apostle Paul sees some people are just eating,
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.920]   you know what, you can eat.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.040]   You can eat.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.840]   But when the attitude of the heart is,
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.680]   but they don't matter.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.560]   They're in complete disregard.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.720]   And not only that, but they're shaming the people
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.960]   who are poor.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.720]   Like, you eat after us.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.560]   Okay?
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.320]   That attitude of the heart now all of a sudden
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:57.520]   makes simple eating all of a sudden incredibly divisive.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.360]   Right?
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.720]   So again, I would say we have to exercise great division,
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.280]   but all, I mean, sorry.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.120]   Whoa.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.240]   (laughs)
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.960]   Someone gave me feedback about my sermon on Sunday too.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.760]   I kept calling Sarah the non-promise line.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.640]   Anyway, I do this all the time.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.880]   We should exercise great discretion.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.840]   Not division.
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.120]   Discretion.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.800]   When we're calling things divisive or not.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.640]   Okay?
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.480]   We should.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.000]   'Cause we couldn't, we can't judge the intention
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.200]   of people's hearts so easily.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.160]   But at the same time, on the flip side,
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.000]   if we think, oh yeah, sometimes I just don't wanna hang out
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.960]   with these people, you know?
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.880]   I just get annoyed by these guys.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:41.960]   Yeah, I mean, sometimes we have the freedom
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.240]   to choose who we hang out with.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.080]   Okay?
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:48.720]   But if you purposefully, intentionally,
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.760]   either because you're bitter you wanna hurt somebody,
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.800]   or either because you're bitter,
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.680]   or either because in your heart you've categorized people,
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.120]   and within the church you exercise that kind
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.960]   of behavior and attitude, I don't know, is that divisive?
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.320]   That's something for you to examine in your own heart.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.160]   Right?
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.120]   As we learned today.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.520]   It's not for me to call out for you,
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.200]   you need to just examine that in your own heart.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.040]   Okay?
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.880]   Good question.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.280]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.000]   Father God, we thank you so much for your grace
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.040]   and your words.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:27.120]   Lord, it really challenges me to look at your grace.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.240]   That God, ah, just think about this fact
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:36.240]   that you would perform a miraculous sign
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.360]   that will be told through the ages,
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.280]   seen amongst the nations,
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.880]   and then people will forget.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.000]   That you would send your son,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.280]   that he would suffer unjustly,
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.880]   that he would die on the cross,
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.960]   and then we forget.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.560]   Thank you God that you're patient with us,
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.840]   and Lord that you have instituted your ordinance
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.040]   that we would remember.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.840]   Father, help us to not be so naive,
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:07.360]   so sinful that we would constantly not be aware
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.800]   and to not recognize what we have in the Lord.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.480]   But help us to be thankful,
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.400]   help us truly to be grateful
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.320]   to the degree to which we will celebrate,
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.440]   to the degree to which we'll have joy.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.160]   And that when we come to the communion table,
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:25.080]   we will gladly just offer up to you our lives.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.200]   When we come to the communion table,
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.720]   it will be a joy and we will find true fellowship
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.160]   just in knowing the Lord.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.280]   And I pray, Father God,
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.960]   that the things that we just covered tonight
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.240]   would really challenge our hearts.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.760]   Father, I'm challenged to examine myself
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:43.640]   of hurtful ways that are in me,
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.520]   perhaps by me simply being so closed-minded
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:51.040]   or so short of sight that I don't see the people around me.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.480]   I pray, Father God, that you'd grant us just greater grace,
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.880]   and I also pray you'd give us greater sight
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.560]   to exercise the kind of love that Christ did.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.040]   Lord, we again wanna thank you for your word.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.760]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
