[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   If you can turn your Bible to 2 Timothy chapter 2,
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.920]   we're gonna continue our series
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.760]   in first chapter 22 through 26.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.740]   2 Timothy chapter 2 verses 22 through 26.
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.240]   I'm reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.000]   So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.520]   faith, love, and peace,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.140]   along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.560]   Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.580]   You know that they breed quarrels.
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.200]   And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.220]   but kind to everyone,
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.920]   able to teach patiently enduring evil,
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.960]   correcting his opponents with gentleness.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.040]   God may perhaps grant them repentance,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.880]   leading to a knowledge of the truth,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.280]   and they may come to their senses
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.840]   and escape from the snare of the devil
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.560]   after being captured by him to do his will.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.400]   Let's pray.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.480]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020]   We thank you for giving us strength to persevere.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.080]   We thank you, Lord, for opening our eyes to see Christ
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.920]   and who he is and causing us, Lord God, to desire him.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.840]   We pray this morning as we've come to worship you
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.760]   that we would worship you with all sincerity in our hearts.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.820]   Help us, Lord God, to open our mind and our heart
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.800]   to your word, that it truly would judge the thoughts
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.000]   and intentions of our heart.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.960]   I pray, Father God, you would sanctify your church,
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.640]   that your love and your sacrifice for us
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.840]   would never become old.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.120]   We thank you, Lord, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.240]   You know, some of you guys were fairly new to our church,
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.840]   and those of you who've been around for a while,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.760]   you know the meaning behind our church name,
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.820]   Acts, it's from Acts chapter 17, 11.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.760]   And part of the reason why we chose this name
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.120]   early on in ministry is because of the meaning behind it.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.200]   Recently, I've been studying,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.080]   or I've been doing quiet time through Thessalonians,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.820]   and again, I'm struck of how the power of the gospel
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.060]   really changed this church.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.960]   And in such a short period of time,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.240]   they became model churches.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.200]   They said that Paul describes them as a church
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.160]   that their faith and love for one another
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.960]   was growing abundantly.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.560]   And so as a result, this church that Paul ended up coming to
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.160]   sending very, probably one of the shortest period of time
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.480]   in this church, and they became the model church
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.120]   all throughout Macedonia.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.480]   But even though this was a model church,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.560]   and we know plenty about the Thessalonian church
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.400]   because there's two whole letters written to them,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.680]   but the persecution in this city,
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.520]   it got to a point where Paul needed to leave.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.840]   But Paul leaves, again, not purposefully,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.040]   but this is probably maybe not even a city
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.000]   that he would have targeted.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.280]   He ended up going to this church called Berea,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.720]   or the city in Berea, because he was escaping persecution,
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.980]   and as he was there, he was preaching the gospel,
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.560]   and people began to come to Christ.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.840]   But he says, again, in Acts 17, 11,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.960]   that this was a church that was more noble
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.600]   than the Thessalonians.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.120]   And the reason why they were more noble
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.880]   is because they tested to see
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.840]   if what Paul was saying was true.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.400]   And so the distinction between this model church
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.840]   of the Thessalonians and why this church is even above them
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.120]   is that they were testing,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.480]   and they put God's word above everything else.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.560]   You and I live in a generation where the teaching
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.120]   of the word of God is not assumed.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.000]   You would assume that if there are Christians,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.840]   that we would be given to the word of God,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   that our faith is coming from what this Bible says,
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.360]   but we are being challenged left and right.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.200]   And some of you guys may know as much as I do
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.760]   that it's not assumed.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.720]   You can't just assume,
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.260]   just because it has an evangelical church name on it,
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.840]   that the word of God is the foundation
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.640]   upon which they are building.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.360]   That is not the case.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.800]   There are plenty of churches
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.160]   that the word of God is being taught,
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.420]   but that is not a common thing that you see today.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.520]   We have to be a church that is committed
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   to the word of God.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.680]   And when I say committed to the word of God,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.240]   I'm not just talking about finding the right church
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.500]   and becoming a member of a church that preaches the word.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.440]   We as individuals in the churches have to be teaching
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.080]   and learning the word of God.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.680]   It's not enough that you are hearing expository sermons.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.740]   It is not enough that you are attending a Bible study
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.000]   where the word of God is open.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.360]   You yourself need to get into the word of God
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.320]   so that you can test if what I'm saying is true.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.640]   Or else what ends up becoming is you end up filtering
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.220]   what you believe to be true or not
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.200]   based upon your own personal prejudice,
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.960]   your own personal experience,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.680]   your own personal memories of what you thought
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.580]   to be true or not.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.000]   So after a while, you realize so much of our faith
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.620]   is based upon what I like and what I don't like.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.480]   And what ends up happening is I happen to go to this church
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.840]   so this is what I believe.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.580]   I like that preacher so I believe what he preaches.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.400]   I like this seminary so I believe what they teach.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.220]   It is no longer safe in our culture and our generation
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.680]   for us to just rely upon what's coming off the pulpit.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.680]   We have to be brains.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.440]   Individually, we have to test the word of God
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.460]   so that if something strange is being taught
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.140]   in the scriptures that you can filter it out.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.400]   Before I ever say it, before any of the elders ever say it,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.580]   that you can say, I don't know if that's biblical.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.180]   I don't know if that's what the word of God teaches.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.720]   See, in Philippians chapter one, 12 to 14,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.180]   Paul actually describes the same situation
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.520]   that he's in in 2 Timothy.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.320]   2 Timothy, as you guys know,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.480]   as we've been studying through it,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.960]   Timothy is timid.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.740]   He's seeing his fellow co-workers,
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.820]   maybe some people have gone before him,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.860]   who were co-workers of Paul, starting to fall out.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.240]   Paul is sitting in prison with a death sentence.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.780]   A few weeks from now, a few months from him
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.600]   writing this letter, he's gonna have his head chopped off
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.940]   and his life was gonna end.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.220]   Now, so the persecution that Paul is writing this letter
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.100]   under was very intense.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.620]   But this is not the first time Paul writes a letter
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.060]   while he's sitting in prison.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.620]   And the response that he got from the first letter
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.520]   was extremely different.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.380]   So again, the background behind 2 Timothy
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.900]   is that Timothy's fallen out
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.100]   or like in temptation of falling out
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.900]   and weak and other people are falling out
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.420]   and Paul is calling them out.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.140]   But in Philippians chapter one, 12 to 14,
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.740]   this is what he says.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.380]   Also writing in prison, also under persecution,
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.980]   he said, "I want you to know, brothers,
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.960]   "that what has happened to me
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.300]   "has really served to advance the gospel.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.840]   "So that it has become known
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.820]   "throughout the whole imperial guard
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.640]   "and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.820]   "And most of the brothers,
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.440]   "having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment,
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.460]   "are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.520]   You notice a difference?
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.240]   Why is it that the first time he is sitting in prison,
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.840]   he says, "More and more people are coming to Christ.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.560]   "It has served to advance the gospel
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.880]   "because they know that I'm in prison because of Christ."
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.440]   And as a result of that, most of the brothers,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.380]   most of the brothers have become more courageous
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.360]   to preach the gospel.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.920]   See, the first time he's writing in the letter,
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.280]   people are not falling out.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.720]   People are very challenged.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.100]   But by the time he writes a second letter,
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.300]   people are falling out left and right.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.020]   In fact, he's afraid that his very disciple,
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.020]   his son of faith, may also burn out and fall out.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.780]   What was the difference?
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.380]   Now, obviously, the intensity of the persecution
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.620]   was a little bit different
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.060]   because Paul, in the first imprisonment,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.460]   was not actually indicted.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.300]   Remember, they kept him around for a couple years
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.260]   and they took him to Rome,
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.580]   hoping that he would give some kind of a bribe
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.060]   to let him out.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.260]   But still, it was no cakewalk.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.220]   He was being persecuted.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.660]   He was chained to a Roman guard for over two years.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.300]   And yet, people respond with courage.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.540]   You know, oftentimes that happens.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.900]   When somebody, you know somebody who's persecuted
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.300]   and say, "Wow, that actually gives us courage."
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.660]   But what was happening with the church
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.340]   in the Second Timothy,
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.900]   that they were starting to fall out
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.540]   and fear was coming upon them
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.580]   and people began to actually go back home.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.740]   I think the difference between his first letter
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.100]   and the second letter is that
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.240]   when he's writing the second letter,
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.260]   between those years,
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.380]   these false prophets came in to Ephesus.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.300]   These false prophets begin to have infiltrate
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.020]   into the church and there was some persecution
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.800]   and there was some division and confusion
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.660]   that came into the church
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.860]   and that's exactly what happens.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.940]   You know, how does a strong church fall apart?
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.740]   Usually, it's because there's division,
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.340]   there's confusion and doctrine
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.900]   and people are no longer united.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.580]   And when we are not united, we crumble.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.580]   And I think that's the difference between the response
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.300]   in Second Timothy and First Timothy.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.780]   That Second Timothy, he's talking to a group of people
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.220]   who are muddied in their theology,
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.900]   where the gospel was compromised
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.260]   and people were no longer sure about what was right
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.260]   and what was wrong.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.780]   If you've ever studied ancient Near East history,
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.060]   you'll find out that Rome was probably one of the biggest
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.180]   and one of the most powerful empires
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.220]   that has ever existed.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.260]   But if you look at every empire prior to them,
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.100]   they were conquered by a greater nation.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.880]   So the Syrians came in, the Babylonians came into power,
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.860]   so they got conquered by the Babylonians.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.980]   Babylonians would come in, the Persians come in
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.340]   and they become a superpower,
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.100]   so the Persians conquer them.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.740]   After that comes Alexander the Great
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.980]   and the Greeks come in and the Greeks conquer them.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.060]   And then Rome comes in, the most powerful of them all,
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.360]   and they conquer the Greeks.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.300]   But the way that the Rome was conquered is peculiar
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.940]   because there is no superpower that comes in.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.740]   I mean, they're considered the greatest power
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.180]   and yet the barbarians were disorganized,
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.200]   very small in number.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.180]   By the time they came into Rome,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.380]   they couldn't even muster up a big enough army
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.720]   to fight against them.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.900]   So in fear, all the Roman soldiers and the politicians,
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.300]   they ended up leaving Rome.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.980]   And then the barbarians just walked in,
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.860]   basically conquered almost without a battle.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.620]   And if you've ever, again, studied the crumbling of Rome,
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.540]   you find out that there were so much internal fighting
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.220]   within Rome that they couldn't muster up enough strength.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.700]   The government was so divided,
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.740]   they hated each other so much
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.280]   that after about 100, 200 years of this,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.500]   there was nothing left within,
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.300]   even though they had the structure of this empire,
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.580]   inside they had absolutely no strength whatsoever.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.920]   So puny little barbarians,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.340]   they walk in and they end up conquering them.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.340]   That's exactly what happens in the church
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.300]   when we are not convicted in our theology.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.700]   If our conviction is simply based upon,
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.100]   I like this guy or trends that are coming in and coming out,
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.460]   or I like to read this book, or I like this guy,
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.100]   but we ourselves are not convicted
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.200]   of the truth of what the word of God says,
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.900]   then we are weak.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.340]   Doesn't matter how much money we have,
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.660]   doesn't matter how organized we are,
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.740]   doesn't matter how much talent is in the church.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.740]   If we are not convicted by the truth,
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.580]   if the Holy Spirit is not working mightily
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.220]   through the word of God
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.580]   in the individual lives of the Christian, we are weak.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.420]   We're divided.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.380]   That's why it's extremely important for us.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.780]   When Paul called Timothy to fight the good fight,
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.460]   the greatest thing that he was telling them to do
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.980]   is make sure that you guard the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.740]   that you don't taint this,
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.420]   that you make sure that you fight.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.580]   So when Paul says here in verse 23,
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.420]   have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversy.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.500]   You know that they greet quarrel.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.780]   We may first read that and say,
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.060]   oh, Paul doesn't want us to fight over anything.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.060]   You know, we should be united.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.060]   And so there's a lot of Christians that think
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.300]   that any kind of argument about doctrine
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.980]   is being judgmental, we're being farisic.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.900]   Is that what Paul is saying in verse 23?
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.300]   Is he telling us that you should just be divided,
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.780]   no matter what?
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.220]   Whether you believe in the deity of Christ or not,
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.220]   or whether you believe in salvation by grace or not,
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.620]   you know, we're Christians and we believe in Jesus,
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.620]   so let's make that our unifying theme and just get together.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.700]   Is that what Paul is saying?
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.540]   Now, obviously not,
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.500]   because if you look at 2 Timothy 10, five,
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.780]   Paul describes his ministry this way.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.740]   We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.160]   raised against the knowledge of God
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.900]   and take every thought captive to obey Christ.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.200]   So Paul describes his ministry as destroying arguments,
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.460]   fighting against wrong opinion about God.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.580]   In fact, when Paul calls Timothy into ministry,
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.100]   1 Timothy 1, 3 and 4,
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.340]   Paul tells Timothy, remain at Ephesus that you may charge.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.540]   Remember that word charge?
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.180]   It's a military term.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.820]   Charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine,
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.620]   nor to devote themselves to myths and endless geniality.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.300]   Paul called Timothy to fight,
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.900]   fight for the integrity of the gospel,
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.540]   command these people to stop making these arguments.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.140]   And then in Titus 1, verse nine,
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.420]   it goes even broader than that.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.980]   He says, the qualification of an elder.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.580]   He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.900]   so that he may be able to give instruction
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.860]   in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.480]   who contradict it.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.200]   So if you wanna be a leader in a church,
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.220]   the first thing that you need to be,
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.440]   you can't simply be a people pleaser.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.740]   You don't wanna get into conflict,
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.900]   or even though they're teaching wrong doctrine,
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.740]   you're like, that's not my job.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.780]   So one of the qualification of an elder
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.780]   is to guard the good doctrine,
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.460]   guard the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.340]   In fact, if you remember Paul in the book of Galatians,
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.340]   he publicly calls out Peter and Barnabas.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.180]   Imagine if Peter and Barnabas reacts
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.820]   against Paul's rebuke.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.020]   Say, how dare you?
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.900]   He's a direct apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.700]   He's a leader among the apostles,
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.300]   and you're gonna publicly humiliate me?
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.460]   Imagine if Barnabas said, I discipled you.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.220]   The apostles would have never even accepted you
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.980]   if it wasn't for me.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.660]   Instead, they see the rebuke,
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.900]   and they actually are humbled.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.260]   And later on, Peter says, pay attention to Paul,
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.220]   Paul's letters, and he says they're equal to scripture.
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.860]   But imagine if that didn't go well.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.100]   Imagine if Paul said, you know what,
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.800]   maybe I shouldn't rock this boat.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.700]   Imagine if people, if this goes wrong.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.220]   I mean, the whole church could have been split
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.300]   into three, four parts,
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.380]   and it would have never been this.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.380]   Imagine if Paul just backed away from this fight.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.860]   You could say, hey, we should just be united.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.340]   Let's just say we love each other.
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.800]   And even though the gospel is being tainted,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.060]   let's just stay together.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.980]   Imagine what the church would look like today.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.580]   See, Paul is not saying back away from the fight.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.260]   He's not saying if people disagree with the gospel,
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.580]   you should just accept it and just, you know,
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.900]   just get together and say kumbaya and love one another.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.660]   He's not saying that.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.460]   Instead, if you look carefully, what he's saying is,
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.420]   he said, avoid, run from foolish arguments,
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.140]   foolish and ignorant arguments.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.620]   The word for foolish is moros,
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.820]   where we get the word moron.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.220]   And I know you probably get a reaction like,
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.420]   moron, that's pretty harsh.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.500]   It's pretty harsh.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.780]   The next word, ignorant, basically is unrestrained,
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.220]   unstructured, undisciplined, uneducated, senseless.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.980]   So to put it in modern English,
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.940]   basically Paul is saying, avoid stupid and dumb arguments.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.740]   He's not telling them to don't get into fights,
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.140]   don't stand up for the truth.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.700]   He said, don't get sidetracked
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.540]   from stupid and dumb arguments.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.540]   That has nothing to do with advancing the cause of Christ.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:47.460]   There's, you know, again, because I'm a pastor,
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.340]   I get, every once in a while, I go to pastor's fellowship,
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.620]   and I really have to guard myself.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.660]   The reason I have to guard myself is because
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.820]   pastors are all teachers in their churches.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.500]   They're all used to having the answers.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.660]   So when you put 15 pastors together,
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.980]   you have 15 teachers and no students.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.300]   So it's easily, all you have to say is,
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.260]   what do you think about this?
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.140]   And for the next two hours, we're arguing over something.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.460]   So every time I go to something like that, I have to pray.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.420]   I have to pray in the morning,
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.860]   please help me to keep my mouth shut,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.140]   no matter what they say.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.860]   Some of these people say some dumb things
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.340]   and help me not to say anything, you know?
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.460]   And I have to, because I'm an opinionated person,
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.580]   so, you know, I don't have a problem
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.740]   telling you what I think.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.260]   So I have to restrain myself.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.900]   And I, you know, what he's talking about
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.460]   is getting entangled with things that in the end,
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.500]   whether you win or lose, it does nothing
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.460]   but causes confusion.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.500]   The first time we went to China,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.980]   I guess it was the second time we went to China,
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.700]   I went in the winter, and I had an opportunity
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.860]   to go attend an underground Bible study.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.620]   So I was so excited.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.460]   And they said a lot of non-Christians were coming,
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.340]   and there was a missionary who came from Tennessee,
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.940]   he was gonna lead the Bible study,
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.340]   went to his apartment, there was about,
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.300]   maybe about 30, 35 students.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.780]   More than half of them were not Christians.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.780]   So I thought, this is awesome,
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.180]   we're gonna be able to participate
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.180]   and see what it's like to build a church
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.900]   in an underground church in China.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.220]   Whole time that we were there,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.220]   he opened up and he said,
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.980]   "Why, you can only read the King James Version."
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.980]   The whole time.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.460]   He had printouts about why it's King James
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.300]   and nothing else.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.780]   And then he began to call out the other missionaries.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.500]   There was a missionary that came from Calvary Chapel,
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.460]   there was a missionary that came from the Southern Baptist,
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.860]   and he's like, "Don't go there
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.100]   "because they don't use the King James.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.580]   "Don't go to that Bible study,
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.900]   "they don't use the King James."
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.660]   So I thought, that's a strange,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.340]   like he has an opportunity to preach the gospel
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.180]   to these students.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.820]   The whole thing that he's stuck up on is the King James.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.140]   After the Bible study was over,
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.100]   about an hour and a half,
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.500]   we're walking out and the student,
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.540]   or the girl that we took to this Bible study,
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.620]   first thing she said to us,
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.460]   "Why aren't Christians sold to Bite?"
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.540]   I really had no answer.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.060]   And I didn't wanna add to that saying,
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.540]   "Don't go to that Bible study."
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.140]   So I was just kind of playing it off.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.300]   I was like, "Ah, maybe he didn't mean what he said,
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.140]   "whatever."
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.100]   We get so caught up sometimes in a church
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.140]   and over trivial things.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.140]   Why are you singing hymns?
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.220]   Why are you not singing hymns?
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.060]   How come you're dressed up?
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.420]   How come you're not dressed up?
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.140]   And all these things, in the end,
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.020]   all it does is promote controversies.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.420]   Is there a motive to advance the cause of Christ?
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.260]   Remember what Paul says to the Corinthian church?
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.820]   Corinthian church was a church that Paul
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.940]   literally risked his life to bring the gospel.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.420]   And initially they were doing well.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.700]   People were coming to Christ.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.500]   But by the time he writes the first letter
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.940]   to the Corinthians, the Corinthians are messed up.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.540]   And the reason why they were messed up
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.700]   is because they were all measuring each other
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.940]   to see who was better.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.580]   I follow Apollos, he's a great preacher.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.900]   I follow Paul because he's a great evangelist.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.300]   He's finding churches everywhere.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.260]   I follow Peter because Peter is a direct disciple of Christ.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.660]   And then some of them even more superior.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.300]   I follow Jesus.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.180]   Basically, in the sight of God,
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.880]   it's like people comparing centimeters, who's taller?
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.220]   It's like, I'm taller than you because I'm five feet eight.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.620]   Oh, I'm five feet eight and a half.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.720]   I'm better than you.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.620]   It's silly arguments in the sight of God in the end.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.380]   So what does it produce?
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.340]   You know how Paul deals with that?
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.500]   He said, all this chaos that's coming into the church
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.620]   because you guys are trying to one up each other spiritually
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.980]   and you think it's godly
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.580]   because you're talking about godly things,
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.460]   but it has nothing to do with God.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.620]   It's your own pride.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.300]   And so you know how Paul deals with this?
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.540]   He said, how many of you were from noble background
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.900]   when you became a Christian?
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.420]   How many of you were really wise?
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.380]   How many of you had some significance?
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.740]   Don't you know that God deliberately chose you
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.980]   because you were nothing?
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.980]   God deliberately chose you
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.040]   to demonstrate the power of the gospel
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.340]   so that somebody who had nothing
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.340]   will become something in the eyes of God.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.140]   So why are you who deliberately,
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.100]   God deliberately chose you because you were nothing,
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.140]   now you're trying to be something in the church?
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.620]   And don't you know that that's the reason
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.500]   that the church is being destroyed?
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.780]   That was the argument.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.980]   I mean, that's as humbling as you can get.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.340]   Proverbs 18, two, it says,
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.480]   a fool does not delight in understanding,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.180]   but only revealing his own mind.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.300]   In other words, when a fool gets into an argument,
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.460]   his goal is not to pursue Christ.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.900]   His goal is not to pursue, you know,
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.780]   the greater cause of the good of the gospel.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.780]   His only desire is I want to know
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.060]   if I'm right or if you're wrong.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.060]   Basically, he wants to know if he's right.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.180]   All he's doing is revealing, this is what I know.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.740]   These are the books that I read.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.500]   This is the theology, these are the degrees that I got.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.220]   But his ultimate goal is not to advance the cause of Christ.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.220]   And that's what Paul is saying.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.540]   He says, don't get caught up in these silly,
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.940]   stupid arguments.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.180]   And all it does is produces more pride
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.780]   and chooses confusion and dissension in the church.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.740]   In 1 Timothy 1, four through seven,
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.340]   it says, don't devote themselves,
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.940]   these people devote themselves to myths
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.400]   and endless genealogy, which promotes speculation
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.220]   rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.360]   Are the things that we are pursuing,
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.640]   are the things that we are standing up for,
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.020]   is it because we want to advance the cause of Christ
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.340]   or is it because we've been offended?
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.700]   Is it because we got in an argument?
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.580]   I remember, you know, used to go on campus at UCI
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.620]   younger, a long time ago,
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.740]   and I would get into arguments with people.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.700]   And typically, I would get into argument
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.060]   and usually a lot of arguments end up becoming
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.420]   about the evolution, about science and faith and all that.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.340]   So I remember reading a Time magazine
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.380]   and one of the articles of the Time magazine
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.380]   basically said that because now we have computers
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.540]   and they can calculate the possibility of evolution,
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.620]   and basically the article basically said
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.940]   that it is improbable,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.620]   the odds that a single cell can mutate
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.780]   to something completely different, macroevolution.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.180]   And he said, it is so improbable
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.860]   that you can't say that this is a fact.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.940]   At best, it is a bad, bad theory.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.720]   And again, this was written in Time magazine
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.340]   by a secular author.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.060]   So I said, awesome, so I copied this.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.940]   I copied this, so whenever I went on campus,
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.340]   I had that in my back pocket.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.340]   So whenever I got in an argument,
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.260]   I was boom, bam, right there.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:33.180]   Read it, right, let's talk afterwards.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.900]   So I actually used to carry that around.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.180]   And I was there, I'm just waiting for,
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.460]   it's like evolution, boom, evolution, right there, okay.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.420]   But the whole time that I've done that,
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.860]   I've never had somebody read that article and say, wow,
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.820]   I didn't know that.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.660]   That's so awesome.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.580]   Let me know about this Jesus that you're talking about.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.500]   Typically what would happen is they would get offended
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.900]   because I would humiliate them.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.060]   And even the way I would talk to them, it's like, shh.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.620]   That's all you got, right?
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.580]   And I would get into this argument with them,
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.660]   and after a while, I got pretty good at it
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.960]   because I know what they would say,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.260]   I know how to answer these things.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.780]   So I would get into an argument,
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.700]   and I would give them this and that,
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.820]   and then after a while, it's like, oh, okay, okay,
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.660]   I guess you know your stuff.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.260]   But what ends up happening is they go back home,
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.720]   they wanna do more research to argue what I said.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.700]   And all I did was to give them more motivation
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.420]   to go poke holes at Christianity because I humbled them.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.080]   I've been in so many situations
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.280]   where you see Christians debating against the scientists,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.760]   and sometimes the scientists win,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.440]   sometimes the Christians win,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.400]   but at the end, I realized all they're doing
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.320]   is to see who's a better debater.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.200]   It's hard to get through all of that
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.240]   because in the end, here's this guy who's a champion debater
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.360]   and he could debate that the banana is green
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.380]   if he wanted to and then convince everybody
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.420]   'cause he's just so articulate, he's funny.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.500]   Every time he says something that,
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.500]   these facts add up, he would say something funny
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.500]   and poke fun of him, everybody laughs in the room, the end.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.620]   And at the end of that, a lot of these events,
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.900]   I find Christians standing up there clapping.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.500]   Ah, you made an idiot of that guy,
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.780]   that guy doesn't know nothing.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.020]   And I remember sitting in the back of one of these things,
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.000]   about 1,500 people, and I was thinking,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.660]   was that the purpose of this?
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.240]   Was this the purpose to humiliate these people?
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.460]   I wonder if this did anything
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.740]   to bring somebody closer to Christ.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.460]   All we did was show we know,
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.860]   and this guy's a master debater,
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.220]   and that guy knows nothing.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.340]   Was that our goal, to reveal what we knew?
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.780]   See, that's what Paul is saying,
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.180]   that you get into these quarrels,
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.900]   and all it does is produces divisions.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.320]   So why, why should Christians avoid these things,
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.600]   and why should we, it's in verse 24.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.960]   Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.880]   but kind to everyone, able to teach patiently,
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.840]   Now, you remember when Paul is saying that,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.880]   remember the background of this man.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.680]   He's sitting in prison, and he had people
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.720]   preaching the gospel just to make it harder for him.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.080]   That's mind-blowing, why would somebody preach
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.900]   this awesome message of sacrifice,
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.080]   and do it deliberately, use that message to hurt this guy?
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.800]   And yet, Apostle Paul was a recipient of that.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.380]   He goes to Corinth, and he preaches the gospel,
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.520]   sacrificing, risking his life.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.280]   In fact, he says when he came to Corinth,
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.560]   he was trembling in fear, discouraged,
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.320]   being beaten up, thrown into prison.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.760]   Every city he goes to, he goes to Corinth,
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.860]   and understandably, he's discouraged.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.920]   Jesus speaks to him and said,
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.800]   "Have courage, continue to do the work.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.920]   "I have many people who are my disciples here."
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.040]   And so Paul, despite his discouragement,
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.680]   risking his life, preached the gospel,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.960]   and he was very fruitful in Corinth.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.800]   But by the time he writes 2 Corinthians,
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.280]   many people in this church was questioning,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.120]   this guy, this guy's not speaking from God,
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.280]   he's not an apostle.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.240]   So the whole letter is him convincing them.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.160]   You think they're apostles, but I am more,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.440]   and he's going through his credentials
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.080]   of how much he suffered, how he almost died,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.760]   and he said, "This is crazy."
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.240]   The fact that he's even having to defend himself.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.600]   And so when he says to Timothy,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.240]   "You must be patient with these people, enduring evil."
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.600]   This is a man who endured a lot of evil.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.520]   Inside the church, we're not talking about outside,
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.480]   inside the church, and at the end,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.720]   he's encouraging his disciple.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.560]   "You must endure, you must be patient."
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.680]   And again, Peter says the same thing in 1 Peter 3, 9,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.040]   "Do not repay evil for evil, or reviling for reviling,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.280]   "but on the contrary, bless, for to this you are called,
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.680]   "that you may obtain a blessing."
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.320]   See, the greatest evidence that a person
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.120]   is a recipient of grace has to be grace.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.760]   Greatest evidence that you and I receive grace is grace.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.400]   That if we are recipients of grace,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.120]   that we would also be people known to be gracious.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:20.000]   God, when Jesus told his disciples
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.680]   that the world would know that you are my disciples,
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.720]   if you have love for one another, as I have loved you.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.320]   If you have any secular friends,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.560]   and I'm sure many of you do,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.860]   and you probably have non-Christian families,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.640]   do your non-Christian mother and father love you?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.040]   Of course they do.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   Do you have a non-Christian brother or sister?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.000]   Do they love you?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.560]   Of course they do.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.880]   So what is so unique about this love that Jesus says,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.920]   "To love one another as I have loved you."
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.520]   The whole world practices love.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.520]   Mother loves father, father loves the mother,
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.880]   that they love their children.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.100]   I don't know too many people, Christian or non-Christian,
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.980]   who doesn't love their kids.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.800]   Or don't love their parents.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.720]   They may be dysfunctional, they may have problems,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.200]   but they still naturally love their family, their friends.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.720]   And even their coworkers.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.800]   There's a lot of people giving to the orphans,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.760]   who aren't Christian.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.080]   So what is so unique about this love that Jesus says,
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.320]   "That the world will know that you are my disciples,
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.760]   "if you have love for one another."
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.680]   What love distinguishes us?
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.780]   Well, the love that the Bible talks about,
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.840]   is this love, people that don't deserve it.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.240]   In this, God demonstrates his love,
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.880]   that he loved us while we were yet sinners.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.680]   He died for us while we were yet sinners.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.040]   He loved people who didn't deserve it.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.040]   Where God's love shines the best,
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.920]   is when it is the darkest.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.160]   When it is the darkest,
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.520]   it's when God's love shines the best.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.120]   If you look at Israel's history,
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.080]   there are some dark periods in Israel's history.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.400]   There are periods in Israel's history,
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.120]   where they actually make human sacrifices.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.480]   These are God's people, who have the law of God,
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.680]   who've seen God in his glory,
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.920]   who've received the law of God.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.200]   God spoke to them.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.640]   He moved with pillars of fire.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.400]   I mean, when they were hungry,
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.800]   he fed them with miracle bread.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.440]   When they were thirsty, he would open up a spring
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.640]   and feed them, or cause them to drink miraculous water.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.080]   And yet, in Israel's history,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.600]   if you look at all of the kings during Israel's history,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.740]   majority of them were idol worshipers.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.720]   They sacrificed human beings.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.960]   In fact, a lot of times,
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.280]   they would bring these idols inside the temple,
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.480]   this holy temple.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.020]   There are some dark periods in Israel's history,
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.640]   but the darkest period in Israel's history
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.480]   was the period when Jesus was led to the cross.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.520]   These recipients of the greatest love of God,
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.980]   they couldn't recognize their own king.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.800]   So when they came, Jesus gave his work.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.400]   He preached, he performed miracles
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.440]   to demonstrate to them who he was.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.760]   And yet, they didn't recognize him.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.000]   Not only did they recognize him,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.320]   they rejected him because he didn't fit
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.920]   what they thought the Messiah would be.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.600]   And then when he goes into Jerusalem,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.800]   he didn't just, he wasn't just hung on the cross
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.320]   by the Romans, he was forced to be hung on the cross
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.180]   by the leaders of Israel.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.520]   The very people he came to die and to save,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.400]   they hand him over and they demand that he gets crucified.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.260]   There's some dark periods in Israel's history,
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.160]   but there's none darker than what that period
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.280]   that led Jesus to the cross.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.680]   But it is at the darkest period of Israel's history
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.880]   where God's love shines the brightest.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.600]   It was while we were yet sinners,
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.200]   while we were hostile toward him,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.440]   he pursued us, he loved us.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.840]   And so at the cross, you see the darkness of human history,
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.540]   as dark as it can possibly get.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.760]   But the greatest hope is also found at the cross.
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.800]   The greatest love was revealed at the greatest sin.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.400]   And so when he says, the world will know
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.700]   that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.760]   as I have loved you, he's talking about the cross.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.920]   As I have loved you.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.560]   So the love that I want you to practice
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.740]   is different than what the love the world practices.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.640]   You love people that don't deserve it.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.860]   You love people who absolutely deserves justice.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.440]   And that's why he says, a Lord's servant,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.060]   not just anybody, but a Lord's servant
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.260]   must not be quarrelsome.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.340]   If you end up having to fight everything
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.780]   because of your own pride,
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.720]   you just become known as that guy.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.420]   You fight about everything.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.540]   So after a while, when you really need to fight
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.980]   for the truth, you've been disqualified.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.880]   Because you're just a hot-tempered guy.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.960]   So Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.720]   but be kind to everyone, patiently enduring evil.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.700]   When the love of God shines the brightest
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.640]   is when we practice love with people
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.200]   that everything in our heart yells no.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.400]   And no one would blame you for hating that person
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.660]   because they deserve it.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.880]   Who would blame God for destroying Israel?
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.240]   Many times over, who can possibly stand before God
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.340]   and say, why didn't you destroy these people?
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.300]   When they were cursing you,
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.360]   they brought idols into the temple.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.520]   After all the time you've shown them mercy,
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.000]   they continue to blaspheme your name,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.960]   continue to forget, continue to drift,
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.920]   and you still love them.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.720]   Who would blame God if he walked away?
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.360]   And yet, he came and he pursued us.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.200]   And that's why he says,
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.160]   the world will know you're my disciples.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.640]   With each other, we can say,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.200]   you don't know my circumstance.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.760]   You don't know what my parents were like
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.320]   when I was growing up and now they yelled at me.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.420]   You don't know the abuse that I got.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.740]   You don't know my background.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.480]   The reason why I behave this way
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.520]   is because of what's been done to me.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.120]   And in the world, we can understand that
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.240]   because that's all they've known.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   They've grown up in a sinful world
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.240]   that was tainted by sin, where sin reigned.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.440]   The God of this age is Satan.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.340]   And so we can understand an individual saying,
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.160]   you've been hurt, so therefore I'm hurtful.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.080]   I've been abused, therefore I tend to be abusive.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.880]   But no Christian could possibly stand before God
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.720]   and say that.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.340]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.500]   No Christian can stand before God and say,
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.660]   I'm doing this because they did this to me.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.140]   And the first thing that God would say is,
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.660]   what about what I did with my son?
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.180]   So for us to stand before God and say,
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.780]   I do what I do because of what they've done to me,
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.220]   it's like saying, you gave me Jesus, but that wasn't enough.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.860]   Any Christian who believes that the son of God
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.260]   stepped off his throne and died for sins,
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.200]   deserving of hell, could not possibly stand before God
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.340]   and say, and justify our sins.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.300]   You can't.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.200]   No Christian who confesses to believe in Jesus Christ
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.440]   can use your circumstance as an excuse
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.600]   to be disobedient, to be harsh, to not to be gracious.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.780]   We're gracious because he's gracious to us.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.640]   That's why Paul says in Philippians chapter 2, 1, 5,
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.700]   so if there is any encouragement in Christ,
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.580]   any comfort from love, any participation in the spirit,
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.980]   any affection and sympathy,
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.160]   complete my joy by being of the same mind.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.660]   Well, is Paul talking about another level of Christians?
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.380]   Here's a bunch of Christians
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.180]   that you believe in justification by faith,
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.220]   and you have faith, and then here's another group
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.760]   of Christians who have been encouraged by Christ,
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.240]   comforted by his love, have participation in the spirit.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.980]   Well, let me tell you, Paul is not talking
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.560]   about degrees of Christianity.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.440]   There is no Christian who has not found encouragement
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.500]   in Christ.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.380]   There is no Christian who has not been affected
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:04.860]   by the love of Christ.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.180]   I say, oh, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.780]   You believe Jesus died for you, right?
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.400]   Yes.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.240]   Then how can you say you haven't been affected
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.340]   by the love of Christ?
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:21.620]   There is no Christian who doesn't fall under
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.900]   every one of these categories,
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.420]   participation in the spirit.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.060]   If the spirit is not in you, you are not a Christian.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.180]   He's not talking about another level of Christian,
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.240]   any affection and sympathy,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.940]   complete my joy by being of the same mind.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.080]   In other words, he's reminding the church,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   look what you have in Christ.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:42.060]   Even in this great church, there was some division.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.980]   These two prominent ladies were fighting,
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.120]   and it was beginning to affect the church,
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.480]   and he said, don't forget what it is that you have.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.140]   You have encouragement in Christ.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.340]   You have comfort from his love.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.960]   You have participation in the spirit.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.880]   You have affection.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.940]   You have sympathy.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.540]   Then complete my joy by having the same mind.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.860]   What mind is he talking about?
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.600]   Same mind as Christ.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.580]   Having the same love.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.760]   What love is he talking about?
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.340]   Same love as Christ.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.660]   Being in full accord with one mind of Christ.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.540]   And so therefore, he says, looking to Christ.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.540]   Let each of you look not only to his own interest,
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.980]   but also to the interest of others.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.720]   Have this mind among yourselves,
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.740]   which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.700]   How can any Christian stand before God
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.340]   and say it is not enough?
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.100]   You don't know my circumstance.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.340]   You don't know what it's like at home.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.220]   You don't know what it's like at school.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:38.440]   Every single one of us has been given the greatest gift.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.380]   Even if we become homeless, and we couldn't pay our bills,
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.280]   and we become diseased, and we die,
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.060]   there's not a single person in this room
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.620]   that can stand before the throne of God and say,
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.340]   Lord, it wasn't enough.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.740]   Son of God was given for us.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.220]   Sometimes we forget that.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.500]   It just becomes a passing thing.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.460]   Yeah, he died for us, but what else you got?
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.940]   And that's why Paul says that
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.220]   a Lord's servant must not be.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.020]   If you've been affected by the grace,
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.700]   you have to be characterized by grace.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.700]   If you've been affected by the love,
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.020]   your life should be characterized by love.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.060]   Finally, he says, why this needs to happen
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.700]   is God may perhaps, if you're gracious and if you're gentle,
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.060]   God may perhaps grant them repentance
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.220]   leading to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.900]   And they may come to their senses
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.420]   and escape from the snare of the devil
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.020]   after being captured by him to do his will.
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:38.100]   In other words, don't forget the ultimate charge is love.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:42.860]   1 Timothy 1.5, Paul, after commanding Timothy
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.340]   to teach these people to stop teaching false doctrines,
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.660]   he says, remember though, the aim of this charge is love,
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.340]   which comes from a pure heart,
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.340]   good conscience, and a sincere faith.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.780]   Not simply to win, not simply to say,
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.740]   oh, I win, I know the Bible more than you,
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.340]   I know the gospel better than you.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.660]   The goal of it is love.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.500]   Possibly to win them over.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.380]   If they're going down the wrong path,
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.220]   our goal should not be to humiliate them
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.140]   and say, look at that, look at what they're doing.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.180]   Instead, he says to go in gentleness,
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.780]   hoping that they will return.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.620]   Galatians 6, one and two.
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.500]   Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression,
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.660]   you who are spiritual should restore him
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.420]   in the spirit of gentleness.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.300]   Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.400]   Bear one another's burdens,
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.740]   and so fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.460]   For me, I know that the Bible teaches church discipline,
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.980]   but sometimes I see the way that church discipline
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.860]   is being carried out, it's almost like vengeance.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.060]   You did wrong, and we're gonna repay you.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.500]   See, I'm always cautious about that,
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.300]   and the reason why is because I know my own heart.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.860]   If you slap me, I don't turn the other cheek,
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.160]   and I say, what this one?
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.740]   That doesn't happen naturally.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.060]   You strike me, my fist is coming up,
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.900]   and I gotta put it down.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.500]   It's like, okay, don't do that.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.380]   People are watching, you know what I mean?
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.420]   If we're in a black alley, maybe, you know.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.300]   That's not my natural response.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.860]   My natural response is vengeance.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.520]   So if somebody does something to hurt me,
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.740]   I'm in a position where I can hurt them.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.420]   I can hurt them much harder than they can hurt me.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.700]   And so I'm always cautious,
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.140]   'cause I'm afraid of my own heart.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.300]   So the standard that I use to test my own heart,
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.100]   because sometimes even I'm confused,
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.920]   would I do that to my own son?
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:39.980]   Would I publicly humiliate him if he was my own son?
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.820]   Is there some way to win him over?
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.620]   Because my desire, if it was my son,
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.100]   is there any way possible that I can turn him around
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:48.940]   and see repentance?
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.820]   Because that would be my desire, not to hurt him.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.260]   So if I wouldn't do that to my son,
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.740]   I shouldn't do that to anybody else.
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.700]   Because my ultimate goal ought to be to win him over,
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.420]   to desire what is best, not to hurt him because he hurt me.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.860]   And that's why he says,
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.540]   the spirit of gentleness to win him over,
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.740]   who knows, he may repent.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.780]   He may come to know Christ.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.820]   He may be saved from the snare of the devil
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.300]   so that he may be won over to Christ.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.100]   Let me wrap up my message this morning with this.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.740]   Because if we lose the big picture
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.740]   of what we are doing in the church,
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.800]   we can easily just become self-righteous,
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.020]   Bible-toting hypocrites if we're not careful.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.100]   Like I know better than you,
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.180]   our church is better than that church,
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.620]   if we're not careful.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.620]   You know, typically when we talk about the prodigal son,
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.140]   you'll hear two different levels of interpretation.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.140]   The first level is the prodigal son.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:49.060]   You know, we've all strayed and the father is waiting
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.180]   and so God is a God of mercy waiting for his son.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.780]   And then if you go to a Bible-teaching church,
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.740]   it's, oh, that's not what that's about.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.900]   It's about the legalistic older brother.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.980]   He's in the background when they're celebrating.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.460]   Why is he being celebrated?
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.620]   So that really is about legalism.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.300]   That's the second level.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.620]   But there's actually a third level
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.900]   of interpretation of this.
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.620]   If you look at Luke chapter 15,
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.140]   you'll notice that Luke chapter 15 begins
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.940]   by saying that Jesus is with the tax collectors
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.220]   and the prostitutes and the sinners
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.580]   and the Pharisees are saying, if you're the Messiah,
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.780]   how can you possibly be hanging around with these sinners?
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.780]   And Jesus, in response to this rebuke,
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.460]   gives three parables.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.540]   And the prodigal son is the third parable.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.940]   The first parable is a parable of having 100 sheep,
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:41.380]   one goes away and he leaves a 99 to chase after the one.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.660]   So he gets the one, puts him on his shoulder,
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.700]   brings him back, and at the end of the parable,
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.060]   there's a celebration.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.540]   Everybody rejoiced, we followed.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.880]   What is the point of that parable?
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.700]   God cares for these sinners.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.820]   They went astray and he loves them so much
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.860]   that he went and sought them out.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.900]   And when he came back, we celebrated.
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.900]   Second parable is about the lost coin.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.820]   He loses a coin and the owner goes
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.700]   and he sweeps the whole house looking for this coin.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.580]   And when he finds it, he's so happy,
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.780]   and I don't know how much this coin is worth.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.280]   But he says it was just a coin,
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.740]   maybe it's made out of diamond.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.860]   But he brings this coin back, and what does he do?
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.180]   He doesn't put it in a banquet, a bank,
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.900]   he has a celebration with the coin.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.140]   So what was the point of this parable?
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:32.020]   That that one coin, it may seem like nothing to you.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.740]   That one sheep, it may seem like nothing to you.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:39.300]   But when the owner finds it, he celebrates.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.860]   So he wasn't even about the sheep.
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.060]   I mean, you're gonna have a whole celebration
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.580]   to celebrate the coming return of one sheep?
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.780]   I mean, just mathematically, right?
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.460]   Financially, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.660]   The one coin, you find that, and you come back,
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.460]   and you're gonna blow all your money
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.900]   because you found that one coin?
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.800]   So you missed the whole point of that.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.220]   That may seem worthless to you,
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.780]   but to the owner, it is precious.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:07.200]   And after that, he gives the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.020]   So the parable of the prodigal son is the same.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.140]   The other one's, one's a sheep, one's a coin,
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.980]   this one's a human being.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.780]   He leaves, he rebels, but he repents, and he comes back.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.260]   And what does the father do?
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.720]   He watches him, eagerly embraces, he rejoices,
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.140]   just like the other parables.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.020]   And then how does the parable end?
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.780]   Rejoicing, he calls everybody, my son has come back.
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.060]   And what is the response of the older brother?
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.540]   Why do you celebrate with this guy
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.740]   who rebelled against you when he comes back?
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.180]   And so, yes, it is about legalism.
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:45.180]   It is about this guy who, the older brother, he's bitter.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.940]   He said, oh, it's about legalism.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.100]   But if you look at the larger picture, it goes beyond that.
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.780]   It's about the nation of Israel
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.540]   who have forgotten their call.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:58.140]   The whole reason why they got stuck on this legalism
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.260]   is because they started measuring themselves
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.860]   with other people.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.060]   We're better, those are sinners, and we're not.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.940]   You don't go to that city because this is where it's pure,
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.840]   and that's where it's dirty.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.420]   And they forgot the whole reason
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.700]   why God called Abraham in the first place.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.300]   He promised him in Genesis chapter 12,
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.900]   I will bless you, and through you,
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.980]   many other nations will be blessed.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.260]   He called the nation of Israel a royal priesthood,
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.020]   a kingdom of nation, of priests.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.180]   In other words, that God was going to lift them up,
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.580]   and then through them,
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.820]   all the other nations will be blessed.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.820]   But they completely forgot about that.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:38.820]   And if you look at the story of Jonah, it was the same thing.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.860]   You know, ah, these are dirty people,
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.060]   these are bad people, they shouldn't be in any,
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.060]   and then when they come to repentance, what does Jonah say?
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.100]   I knew you were gonna do that.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.380]   And that's not what I wanted.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.700]   Remember how that book ends?
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.300]   Why do you care that these people,
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.580]   they can't even determine from left and right
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.060]   that I have mercy on them?
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.660]   And the book ends like that, with a rebuke.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.380]   Rebuke to Jonah, rebuke to the nation of Israel.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.340]   You forgot why I pursued you.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.580]   You forgot why I blessed you.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.260]   And so the rebuke in the prodigal son
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.940]   is that you should be pursuing these sinners.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.960]   You're concerned that I'm hanging around with these sinners,
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.620]   but you don't know I came to seek and save the lost.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.740]   You're the one who's wrong.
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:29.020]   They, these sheep, this coin, this person,
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.680]   was so precious to me,
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.600]   and you're so caught up thinking about, am I right?
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.300]   Am I clean?
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   And you've forgotten about who our God is.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.940]   He's a God who does not delight.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.140]   In punishment, it says,
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.020]   he came to seek and save, though even the Son of Man
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.820]   did not come to be served, but to serve
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.340]   and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.420]   So if our church ever gets caught up,
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.500]   oh, we have this program, we're doing this,
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.060]   and we're doing that, and our church is growing,
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.860]   we got a large facility, people love each other,
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.060]   and it may be a great church on the surface,
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.220]   but if we're not vitally pursuing the lost,
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.340]   you have forgotten the whole reason why you and I are here.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.820]   It's not for us to be here and be clean and be righteous,
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.260]   and then compare with other people
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.240]   and look how great we are.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.100]   If we're not broken for the lost, you missed the whole point.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.420]   When Jesus told his disciples,
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.660]   I am the way and the truth and the life,
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.220]   no one comes to the Father but through me,
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.860]   and in the next I am statement, he says, I am divine,
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.020]   no one bears fruit unless you abide in me.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.720]   What was he telling his disciples?
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.120]   If you follow me, you have to do what I'm doing.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.100]   If you abide in me, you will bear fruit.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.340]   Keep coming.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.420]   And that's what the scripture says,
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:44.500]   if you have love for one another as I have loved you,
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.380]   the world will know you are my disciples.
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.820]   And what love is this?
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.620]   Loving people who don't deserve it.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.260]   Strangers in this world,
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:58.740]   have you forgotten what it was like before you met Christ?
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.460]   Have you forgotten the darkness that you were in?
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.920]   The utter hopelessness of not knowing why you existed?
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.820]   Having sin in your life and guilt in your life,
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.860]   and you didn't know what to do with that.
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.380]   And how it weighed you down,
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.940]   how you were utterly hopeless, lonely, and dejected
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.480]   before you knew Christ.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.260]   The whole world is under the reign of sin,
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.860]   and the only hope is Jesus Christ.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.420]   And for us to forget and to be satisfied
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.720]   because our bills are paid,
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.980]   and because our children are healthy,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.580]   and there's no war, and there's no disease,
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.060]   and we get so wrapped up in these trivial things,
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.420]   and we forget the big picture.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.700]   We're on the boat because we got saved,
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.060]   but what about those people who didn't make it?
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.920]   See, that's what Jesus was saying in the prodigal son.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:56.780]   The father is celebrating because my son came back.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.540]   Of course the father's gonna celebrate.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.280]   Why aren't you celebrating?
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.560]   Why aren't you helping me out?
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.340]   Why are you in the back and just pointing fingers?
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:10.700]   If you miss this, you miss the whole point.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:15.660]   We're not here because like, oh, we have the right doctor.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.260]   We have the right word.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.100]   We have the right church.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.660]   We have good friends.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.180]   Don't ever forget what it was like before you met Christ,
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.220]   because the rest of the world is under that bondage,
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.140]   and you and I have the key to release them.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.780]   I am not ashamed of the gospel,
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.720]   for the power of God unto salvation
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.680]   to everyone who believes,
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.500]   I pray that that conviction will move you
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.700]   and change you into obedience,
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.700]   to take the cross, go to the nations, and make disciples.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.020]   Would you pray with me?
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:03.500]   Take a few minutes to pray for the loss that you love,
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.420]   your father, your mother, your brother, your sister,
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.780]   a coworker, a friend.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:13.640]   If you've forgotten what it was like to be lost,
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.380]   and because of that, your heart has become callous,
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.900]   that there's no sense of urgency,
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.660]   whether they come to Christ or not,
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.660]   that you would first come before the Lord
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.540]   and ask for forgiveness.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.160]   Lord, forgive me for having a callous heart.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:33.460]   Forgive me for giving up and not trusting in you.
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.700]   Forgive me for not seeing the consequence
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.420]   of not abiding in Christ.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.420]   That come before the Lord in genuine repentance.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.960]   Lord, I wanna be a true worshiper.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.700]   Lord, give me your heart,
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.140]   so when I see the multitude,
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.240]   that I may have compassion be broken,
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.340]   that the power of the gospel
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.640]   would not simply be a safety net or a security blanket,
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.260]   but it'd be a power that saves.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.260]   So let's take a few minutes to come before the Lord
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.620]   and confess and ask the Lord to bless us and strengthen us.
