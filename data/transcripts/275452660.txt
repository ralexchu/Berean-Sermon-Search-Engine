[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 14, we're going to be reading from
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.720]   verse 13 all the way down to the end of the chapter, verse 23.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.720]   Our main focus this morning is going to be on verse 20 to 23.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.920]   Romans chapter 14, verse 13 to 23.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.400]   "Therefore, let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.160]   to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.000]   I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.120]   is unclean for anyone who thinks it is unclean.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.680]   For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.640]   By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.000]   So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.040]   For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.440]   and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.960]   Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men, so then let us pursue
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.440]   what makes for peace and for mutual building.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.360]   Do not for the sake of food destroy the work of God.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.480]   Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480]   he eats.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.680]   It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.120]   The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.740]   Christ is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.720]   But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.080]   For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.880]   That's right.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the constant mercy, grace, forgiveness, Lord,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.000]   that causes us to persevere.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.040]   Help us to have a greater glimpse of who you are, not just understand the letter of the
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.440]   law, but your very heart, Lord God, that is contained in these words.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.800]   I pray that your word that is truly living and active would judge the thoughts and intentions
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   of our heart, that we may see beyond the superficial and to search within our own hearts, Lord
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.560]   God, that we may establish Christ inside and out.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.880]   May your name be exalted.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.920]   May your church hear your voice and follow you.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.520]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.960]   Alright, so as we've been in Romans chapter 14, the practical application of what it means
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.600]   to be saved.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.960]   And that's basically the theme of chapter 12 all the way to chapter 16.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.560]   Understanding the grace of God, the justification, what does that look like in the life of a
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.080]   Christian individually and collectively?
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.680]   And so that's the overarching theme in the text that we're at.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.760]   And in that overarching theme, he's talking about how to practice love.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.080]   And again, you can talk about love in the workplace, you can talk about love in the
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.620]   family, and that's not uniquely Christian.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.960]   Any human being is going to teach their children to love their brother.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.120]   And if you're a good parent, you might teach people how to love people who are strangers,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.560]   social justice, feed the homeless.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.840]   But the love that the scripture teaches goes much beyond that.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.880]   It says it's to reflect the love of Christ.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.280]   Love people that are hard to love.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   That are things that are naturally that we may not practice, but we practice because
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.020]   of what Christ has done.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.840]   So he's not just teaching us just to practice any kind of love.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.040]   He's trying to teach us what it means to practice a love that is compelled by the love of Christ.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.380]   And this very specific context he's talking about is where you're in a context where you
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.280]   feel that you are right, but you're in a context of other people who don't agree with you.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.440]   Throughout the years, I've had so many different conversations, and we would call these areas
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.120]   gray areas, right?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.440]   Whereas there's no clear right or wrong.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.800]   Whether there's clear right or wrong, people have all kinds of opinions on it.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.360]   Some people have very strong opinions, some people are neutral, some people are negative.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.880]   The obvious one is drinking, and Paul actually talks about drinking in this text.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.040]   I don't know how many times I've had conversations throughout the years about is it okay, is
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.040]   it not okay?
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.040]   What context?
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.120]   Who's drinking it?
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   What has too much alcohol?
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   What does not?
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.960]   Smoking?
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.560]   What kind of movies that Christians should be watching or not watching?
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.760]   Clothing, what does it mean to be modest?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.800]   Well, one person considers modest, another person thinks it is not.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.300]   Using band in worship, I know today it's pretty much accepted all across the board, right?
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.240]   Most churches you go to will use some sort of praise team.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.680]   This was pretty new.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.920]   The modern day praise team that you see here, this is not how worship looked like maybe
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.000]   about 25 years ago.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.640]   When I first became a Christian, it was really rare to see somebody up on the stage with
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.000]   even a guitar.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.800]   It was usually pipes or a piano.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.440]   And it wasn't until the charismatic movement came in where the praise team started to pick
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.440]   up.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.800]   And I remember at that time there was a big debate, is that okay?
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.840]   To have a praise team and a band and then a lot of the older generation were saying,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.480]   "Hey, it looks more like a rock concert than worship."
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.320]   Even though today it's no longer a debate.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.280]   I remember when projectors started coming in.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.040]   Sometimes we don't remember, but when we used to use projector, we're talking about this
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.440]   projector.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.280]   Prior to that was the Scantron.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.480]   And then prior to that was just a piece of paper, right?
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.240]   But I remember people had a problem with that paper because prior to that, we all sang hymn
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.520]   books.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.240]   You went to church, there was a hymn book sitting where you had to buy a hymn book to
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.680]   come to church and that's what we sang.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.300]   And so when the contemporary music started coming in, they didn't have books to have,
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.280]   so they would write it out on a large piece of paper and they would flip the page.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.560]   So we were singing songs and you're done with one sheet, you would just put it over and
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   then you would sing that one.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.720]   Then if you want to go back and repeat, you got to go back and do this and repeat that
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   other.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.960]   And then the Scantrons came on and then I don't remember the big debate over the Scantron,
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.280]   but the projection when it came on, there was a lot of debate.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.920]   Should a church be using this?
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   This is too modern.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.960]   This is going to be distracting from God's word.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.600]   I mean, I don't know any church that doesn't use that now, but I remember having discussions
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.480]   with other Christians at that time about is it right for the church to use projection?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.640]   Use of skits during services, family worship, should the children be joining the main service
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.640]   or not?
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   I've had discussions about worship isn't true worship until we recite the Apostles'
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.840]   Creed and Lord's Prayer.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.000]   How often should we have communion?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.680]   Every Sunday, every other Sunday, once a month, once a year, only on special occasions.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.200]   How we dress on Sunday, should we be wearing a tie?
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.720]   Should we make it a mandate that everybody dress a certain way?
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.080]   What we do on Sunday, are you allowed to work on Sunday, not work on Sunday?
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.120]   You will be traveling on Sunday?
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.440]   Does worship even have to be on Sunday?
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.080]   That was a big debate when the Seeker Friendly Movement came in.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.240]   Can we have it on Wednesday?
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.760]   More and more churches are having worships on Friday nights or Saturday.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.120]   And I remember when that first came in.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.440]   Now there's a debate, you know, there's discussion as multi-sites where somebody preaches and
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.040]   then they project the pastor on another screen in another campus in order to accommodate
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.040]   the growth.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.800]   I mean, all kinds of things.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.200]   Should we have membership, not have membership?
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.400]   And various opinions all over.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:06.840]   And sad to say, some churches, I mean, we're talking about the universal churches, divided
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.600]   over a lot of these non-essential things.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.560]   And again, I haven't been a Christian long, but I've been Christian long enough to see
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.640]   different trends coming in and what Christianity, at least on the surface, looked like 34 years
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.400]   ago, 35 years ago, is very different than Christianity today.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.360]   So if I was to take myself out from 1983 and pluck myself in today, Christianity looks
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.520]   very different than when I first became a Christian.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.040]   And I had to go through some transitions to be okay with certain things that was coming
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.400]   into the church.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.120]   What things do I need to fight for and what things I just need to learn to change?
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:52.480]   When I first went to Biola, I had to actually sign a statement saying that I will never
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.280]   drink, smoke, or dance.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   Some of you guys are laughing.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.480]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, they made you sign that?"
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.440]   It was not unique to Biola.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.080]   If you went to a Christian school, that was the requirement of many of the schools.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.160]   Again, it's like, okay, drinking, okay.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   Smoking for sure.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   Dancing, right?
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.080]   And some of you guys love swing dancing.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.420]   You guys would not have been accepted to Biola.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.960]   So I know times have changed.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.000]   Certain things that would have shocked people 30 years ago is no longer the issue today,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.840]   and it may not be an issue of sin or compromise.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.920]   Some of the things in culture just don't have that same kind of stigma.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.280]   Paul is not talking about being loosey-goosey at church where there are no boundaries, there
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.440]   are no teachings that if you feel right in your heart, just practice, don't judge anybody.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.280]   That is not what Paul is saying here at all.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:56.520]   The scripture is very clear in its mandates about our relationships, about our marriage,
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.360]   about use of spiritual gifts, money, stewardship, sexuality, social justice, raising children,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.420]   lawsuits in the church.
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.680]   Even in the church, it talks about ordinances and how to choose leadership, disciplining
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.760]   those who are hurting the church and hurting themselves, sending out missionaries, laying
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.400]   hands, ordination.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.360]   The scripture is not just saying, "Well, if you feel right in your heart, you can do
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   whatever you want."
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.120]   That is not the case at all.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:30.320]   Oftentimes we use this passage to talk about gray area, right?
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.640]   Like how do we deal with gray area?
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.080]   It is the appropriate text to talk about that because the principles that he teaches apply
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.780]   to that.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:50.940]   But is the issue of eating meat and celebrating special days, was that a confusing issue?
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.000]   It was confusing because it was during a period of transition.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.760]   But was Paul confused about this idea?
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.360]   Does Paul not have an opinion on this?
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.560]   He said, "Well, God has nothing to say about this.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.200]   You just choose whatever you want."
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.760]   Is that what Paul says about this?
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.920]   No, Paul is very clear about this.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.120]   In fact, he talks about it quite a bit in all of his writings, that that covenant has
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.560]   passed, that meat is clean.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.680]   He actually wants the weaker brothers to eventually become strong.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.920]   So he's not talking about an issue that's debatable and it's right on both sides.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.600]   That's why he used the term weak and strong.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.760]   The strong brothers are the ones who are able to accept this truth and it has already transitioned.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:40.700]   So he's talking about an issue, in dealing with an issue where there is a clear right,
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:47.120]   but being patient with those who have not come to terms with that yet.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:53.520]   The reason why this is so important is because the way we approach when we know it's a gray
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.540]   issue, I could be wrong, I could be right.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.120]   We can be a little bit more generous.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.100]   We can be a bit more gracious.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:07.200]   The problem that we run into is when we are convinced we are right.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:13.280]   How do we deal with weaker brothers or people who may not agree with us, but it seems to
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.780]   be that that's what the scripture teaches?
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:23.560]   Because oftentimes it's the way that we deal with truth that causes the divisions and the
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   fights in the church.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.320]   So what I want to look at today, and I'm going to work backwards, we're looking at verse
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:36.560]   20 to verse 23, and I'm going to work with the second part of that, verse 22 and 23,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.760]   and then we're going to get to the beginning part of it, because I believe that this is
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.800]   a conclusion of what he's been saying, or at least kind of beginning to wrap up, and
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.920]   the main part of what he wants to say is really stated in the first part, verse 20 and 21.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.000]   So it's a two-point, and I'm going to get to, again, the main part in verse 20 and 21.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.160]   So I'm going to reverse the order.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.480]   First part, let me read that passage, 22 to 23.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.680]   The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:12.480]   Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.600]   But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.840]   for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.560]   So the first part I want to convey to you is that Christian liberty can lead us to sin
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.440]   when practiced selfishly.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:39.720]   Even if it is right, even if you're convinced that it's right, when truth is practiced selfishly,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.480]   self-righteously, without considering the conscience of others, it could literally lead
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   to sin.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.400]   So in this passage, verse 22, it says, "In the faith that you have, keep between yourself
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   and God."
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.640]   What does that mean?
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.040]   Keep it between yourself and God.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   Stay quiet.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   Don't say anything.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040]   Right?
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.920]   That's what we may first think that he is saying.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:08.720]   What he is saying is, you are blessed to be able to live with a clear conscience.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.280]   Before you pass judgment on other people, when he says, "Keep it to yourself," he says,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.080]   "Don't flaunt your freedom because you're right."
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.600]   Let me say that again.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.480]   Don't flaunt your freedom because you're right.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.120]   Jesus declared very clearly that the food was clean.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.400]   In Mark chapter 7, 18-19, he says, "He said to them, 'Then you are also without understanding.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.520]   Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, since it enters
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.720]   not his heart but his stomach and is expelled?'
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.880]   Thus he declared all foods to be clean."
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.480]   Imagine how radical that is.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.080]   We've been studying the book of Leviticus, and God made it very clear.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.440]   If you eat this, you become unclean.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:03.160]   And Jesus Christ says all of that ultimately was part of God's redemptive plan to keep
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.020]   the nation of Israel separate and holy.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.180]   Now that the kingdom of God is going to be open to the Gentiles, he's taken away the
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.840]   barrier that separated the Gentiles and the Jews.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.680]   So Christ is about to bring in the new covenant, and to prepare them for that, he's getting
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.000]   rid of the division that was caused because of this food, unclean and clean.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.200]   So Jesus says, "In and of itself, it never really made you unclean.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.080]   In and of itself, just because you ate pork, all of a sudden, did not cause you to be a
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   sinner.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.000]   It was the rebellion against God, refusal to obey God.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.220]   That's where the sin lied.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:47.520]   But it wasn't independently, it's something innately evil about pork."
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.800]   So Jesus made it very clear where he stands on this.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.400]   He's trying to get the weaker brother to become strong.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.240]   Jesus says it again in Acts 10, 9 through 16.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.500]   He's talking to Peter, who's about to bring the gospel to the Gentile world.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.440]   And this is what he says, "The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.920]   the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.880]   And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it,
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.000]   he fell into a trance and saw the heavens open and something like a great sheet descending,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.920]   being let down by its four corners upon the earth.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.400]   In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles and birds of the air."
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.160]   And all of these things are declared unclean in the book of Leviticus.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.320]   And there came a voice to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.520]   Which is something that Peter as a good Jew never did.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.520]   And Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.160]   unclean."
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.480]   Peter probably thought this was some kind of a test, right?
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.040]   He said he failed before.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.240]   He's not going to fail this one.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.840]   He said, "No, I'm not going to do this."
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.720]   And the voice came to him and again, a second time, "What God has made clean, do not call
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   common."
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.360]   This happened three times and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:09.680]   So he made it absolutely crystal clear as Peter, as the leader among the apostles, that
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.480]   Jesus says it's clean.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.720]   So as long as he says it clean, you don't declare it unclean.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.040]   And he says it three times for confirmation, right?
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:24.320]   Then right after this, he is called to a Gentile home in order for him to pray for him and
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.840]   then bring him to Christ.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.680]   So it was signaling that the kingdom is opening up to the Gentiles.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.120]   Now why do I say all of this?
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.560]   Because Paul is not dealing with something that was great that could be right or wrong.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:44.120]   Paul is declaring something that where he has a clear stance on.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:51.080]   God has moved from the old covenant to the new covenant, but he's dealing with the situation
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:56.480]   where you know this is true, but you're dealing with people who are slow to come to that turn,
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.480]   come to those terms.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.760]   Why is this so important?
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:07.080]   Because if we don't deal with truth in grace and love, what did we say last week?
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.960]   My main point last week is the same point this week.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:20.020]   If you deal with truth without grace and love, it always leads to condemnation.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:26.580]   And that's what a church looks like that is high on truth and theology, but low on grace
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.000]   leads to Phariseeism.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.160]   And all it does is train a bunch of people to see who's doing wrong.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.280]   And we feel compelled to point out what's wrong because we have the word of God behind
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.280]   us.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.200]   That's the situation that Paul is dealing with, with this.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:52.280]   The stronger brothers acting in selfishness instead of helping the weaker brothers, just
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.560]   condemning them.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.360]   So that's what he means when he says something good can easily turn to evil.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   Keep it between yourself.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.740]   In other words, practice what you believe.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.360]   The Lord has blessed you.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.100]   It is only by the grace of God that you're able to understand that and able to enjoy
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.100]   the food.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.680]   And that's what he means.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.520]   Enjoy it without judging others.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:22.680]   But whoever doubts if he eats it because he is eating it not in faith, he is condemned.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:32.000]   Isaiah chapter 1, 11, God sends the prophet Isaiah to point out their sins.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.120]   And in their sin basically says, "What to me is a multitude of your sacrifices, says
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.120]   the Lord.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.600]   I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.680]   I do not delight in the blood of bulls or the lambs or the goats."
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.720]   Which is every part of what he said here, they were doing in obedience to God.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.440]   Who told them to give burnt offerings and the rams and all these sacrifices?
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   God did.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.280]   And yet God says, "I detest them."
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.520]   Why does he detest them?
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:10.360]   Because they were practicing truth on the outside while their inside was full of corruption.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.200]   Again, it says in Isaiah 5, 20-22, "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil."
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.880]   You know, who is he referring to?
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   Israel.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.560]   He's not talking about those bad people in Assyria or Babylon because Isaiah was sent
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:33.040]   to bring the message to Israelites who are very religious but inwardly they were calling
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.920]   good evil and evil good.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.120]   "Who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.240]   for bitter.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.560]   Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and shrewd in their own sight.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:50.640]   Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and valiant men in mixing strong drink."
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.080]   They created for themselves, "Well, as long as I'm giving a lot of burnt offerings, as
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.720]   long as I'm giving all of these things, and as long as I'm very active at the temple,
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.000]   they're blind to their own sins."
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.780]   And because they were practicing truth without grace, it was leading to condemnation.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:15.000]   What does it mean when he says, "If your brother's conscience, if it bothers him and it's not
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.200]   of faith, to him it is sin."
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.360]   Why is this such a big deal?
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.080]   And I'm going to give you, I think the best way to share with you what he says here is
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.480]   to give you a very specific story that I remember.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.520]   When I was a youth pastor, there was a, again, she was a young girl at that time, she's not
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.600]   young now, but I remember when she was younger in youth group, she was so excited about her
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   faith.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.720]   She was the one who started the Christian club at Irvine High School, and this is years
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.200]   ago.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:56.040]   And she was so active, she was, I think she was on the ASB, and so she was in honors.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.760]   And so she was very popular and had a lot of friends, had a lot of influence.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.600]   And so when we were having youth group, I was at Irvine Baptist, it was only about a
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   block away from Irvine High School, so we started afternoon Bible studies.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.920]   And because she was such a popular girl, during lunchtime, she would bring all her friends.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.400]   So every Wednesday, we would have Bible study at Irvine Baptist during lunchtime, and they
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.480]   would come, about 30 of them would come, and I would share the gospel, give them pizza,
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   and then they would go back, and it was a great time.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.320]   And as she was graduating, she was sharing with me how she wanted to become a missionary
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.200]   and how she wanted to really serve God.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.500]   And then she got great grades and she got into Berkeley.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.440]   And then, this is before Facebook and all this stuff, and it's hard to keep in touch,
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.360]   and she went up to Berkeley, and then she would come down only during the break.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:48.440]   But I could tell that each time she came down, she just was not the same person.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.680]   And after about a year, year and a half passed, I could tell she completely drifted away from
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.560]   her faith.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.640]   And so obviously, being her former youth pastor, I was concerned, and so I met up with her
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.760]   and knocked her, "Hey, what happened to you?
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.920]   What happened up there?"
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.720]   She said she went to this particular church, and it was great.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.080]   All of her friends went there, and it was exciting as a freshman, and she said, "But
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.280]   something strange happened."
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.520]   What happened was after the Bible study, the small group leader would invite all of the
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.440]   students to go to the bar and hang out.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.200]   So initially, obviously, coming from a conservative church, she thought it was weird, but everybody
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.040]   else was going.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.960]   This is our small group leader inviting her to go, and it bothered her conscience, but
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.760]   all her friends were going.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.440]   This was our small group leader.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:44.240]   And it was nothing to do in and of itself of drinking, but it bothered her conscience.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.420]   And she decided to give in, because that was the culture.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.200]   So the issue wasn't drinking in and of itself.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:00.520]   And I never said to her that Christians should never drink, because that's not my position.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.400]   I don't have a strong position one way or the other.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.120]   I think it's completely just, I know some people grew up drinking at home, and some
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.200]   people have a very harsh disdain toward drinking.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.400]   So I don't have that strong position, so that's not what I said to her.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.060]   But it was a conservative church, generally.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:24.860]   But once she crossed that line where it bothered her conscience, that set the pattern for her.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.740]   And so other things would happen, and she crossed that line, because she crossed the
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:33.060]   line over here, and there was no clear reason why she crossed this line, other than other
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.260]   people were doing it.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.180]   So once she crossed that line, there was another line that was to be crossed, and then she
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.300]   crossed that, and another line to be crossed that.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:46.720]   And then eventually, when it was very clear that it was wrong, because she set a pattern
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.940]   of going against her conscience, it completely ruined her.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:25:00.360]   When Paul says here, "Not to go against your conscience, because whatever is not of faith,
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:05.800]   it is sin," that's what he is referring to.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:14.740]   The act in and of itself may not be sin, but the fact that we think that it might be, and
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:21.100]   then we go ahead and do it anyway, that pattern is going to manifest in other areas of our
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:26.940]   life, whether it is with purity, whether it is with relationship, whether it is use of
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:34.620]   money, whatever seems to be convenient, that we will set a pattern of setting aside convictions
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:42.440]   and truth for the purpose of belonging, and acceptance, and convenience, and safety.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.580]   That's what he means.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:52.380]   So in practice of liberty, in the practice of truth, if we don't consider the context,
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:57.820]   if we don't consider our conscience, it can easily lead to not only to condemnation of
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.620]   others, but even our own condemnation.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.020]   So to go against conscience is not safe.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:10.820]   Secondly, which is where I want to spend the rest of our time here, secondly, Christian
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:17.900]   liberty, the liberty that God has given us to enjoy the things that we have been given.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.220]   Christian liberty was meant to build and not to destroy God's work.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.740]   Christian liberty was meant to build and not to destroy God's work.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.580]   Verse 20, "Do not for the sake of good destroy the work of God."
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.100]   God in and of itself is very confused.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.140]   Do not for the sake of good destroy the work of God.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.860]   Because we would normally think, well, if it's good, if it's biblical, it's going to
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.860]   build up the kingdom.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.820]   But he says, no, do not for the sake of good.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:47.420]   What you think is good, what you are convicted is good.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.680]   Don't let it destroy God's work.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:55.100]   Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.100]   he eats.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:02.260]   It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:08.140]   In other words, in and of itself, it may be good.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.780]   But when we are practicing it outside of the context of the people that we are around,
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.180]   and we don't care about their conscience, we don't care about the unity, we are just
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.160]   practicing truth because I am convinced this is true.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.860]   He says, in the end, you may cause someone else to stumble, and as a result of that,
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.300]   you are destroying God's work.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:34.300]   So something that was good can easily be turned to something evil or destructive if we practice
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.340]   it selfishly.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.620]   So what does it mean to destroy the work of God?
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:44.900]   Well, there are two specific things that he speaks about.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:51.220]   One is the specifics of the weaker brother, how it bothers his conscience.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:56.900]   We can destroy his conscience with our freedom, and as a result of that, be condemned ourselves.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:02.180]   In Romans 14, 15, he says, "For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.940]   walking in love."
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:11.820]   You just practice your truth because this is what I believe, and he just does whatever.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.380]   He says, "But you're not walking in love."
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:19.540]   And walking in love is the primary call, primary motive.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.980]   It is not one of many things that God has called us to do.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.300]   It is the primary thing that he calls us to do.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:32.540]   So he says, "In your practice of freedom, if it causes your brother to be grieved, you
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:40.180]   may be strong in your theological position, but you are weak in practice."
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.940]   You're immature in practice because you're not considering others.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.940]   He says, "By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died."
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:56.660]   Paul goes so far as to say that it is wrong to practice your newfound freedom with food
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.820]   without acknowledging the weaker brother's conscience.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.820]   It is wrong.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:07.260]   Again, in 1 Corinthians 11, remember we talked about how the whole book of Corinthians is
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:14.440]   about this disunity, this selfish, self-centered practice of truth which led them to be divided
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.440]   in the church.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.440]   "I'm right.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.440]   You're right."
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.580]   And it divided between people who were loyal to Peter, to Apollos, to whoever, and he said
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.980]   that caused all kinds of chaos in the church.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.220]   And even at the communion table, they were coming to communion.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.380]   And again, in the early church, it was kind of like a potluck.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.980]   Everybody got together and they shared their food, but the rich people obviously who had
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:42.100]   more than abundance of food, they would come early to the church and they would just eat.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.900]   And then the people who didn't have money would come, and by the time they came, there
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.180]   was nothing there.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:52.100]   And by doing that, not only were the people not eating, it was highlighting the fact that
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.600]   poor people didn't have that blessing.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.420]   So it was causing this division between the rich and the poor.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:04.060]   It is in that context where Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11, "He who eats and drinks without
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.660]   acknowledging the body of Christ does what?
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.820]   Eats and drinks judgment upon himself."
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:18.260]   So this sacred communion table, which God gave as a blessing to bring the church together
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.900]   because of the way that they were practicing it in selfishness, was actually causing divisions
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:28.220]   in the church because it was causing other people to stumble.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.300]   So let me say this again.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:36.820]   The practice of truth without grace and mercy always leads to condemnation.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.420]   And that's what he was dealing with.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.700]   And that's why he says in 1 Corinthians 14, 12, "So with yourself, since you are eager
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:49.060]   for manifestation of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church."
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:53.580]   Whatever opinions you have, whatever practices you have, does it build, does it destroy?
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.860]   1 Corinthians 10, 23, 24.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.820]   All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:05.420]   You may be right legally, but is it helpful?
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.700]   Does it produce, does it build up?
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.020]   But not all things build up.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:15.180]   Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:21.180]   Now I can say all this stuff and you may feel stressed.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.620]   Not only do I seek the truth, I have to seek truth in the context of what other people
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:30.100]   are proposing, and I know where this discussion usually will end.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.420]   Where do you draw the line?
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.420]   Because you feel burdened.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.420]   Because, you know, like, "Hi."
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:41.260]   You know, somebody goes, "Somebody stumbled because he wore a tie."
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.220]   Yeah, I've had discussions with people.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.980]   "Why do you do that?"
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.780]   You know, like a Pharisee.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.940]   And then there's people who are disturbed that I don't wear a tie.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.700]   Or, "Yeah, how come you don't wear a tie?
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.700]   Are we becoming seeker-friendly?
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.700]   What's going on?"
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.700]   Right?
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.980]   I mean, anything that we do, right, is going to, "How come the children aren't in the
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.980]   worship?
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.300]   How come you don't do this?
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.300]   Why do you do that?"
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.420]   "Why do you have two guitars?"
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.980]   You'd be surprised what bothers people.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.740]   It bothers people, right?
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.740]   I lost my train of thought.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.740]   Where was I?
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.740]   All right.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.140]   I was just venting.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.500]   It could easily lead to that.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.940]   It could lead to, like, "Well, where do we draw the line?"
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.940]   And then when you get to that point, it kind of bounces back.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.940]   So we don't draw any line.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.940]   "Yes, you're right.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.940]   You're right.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:32.940]   You're right.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.940]   Oh, but where do we draw the line?"
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.740]   Boom, we're back over here where nothing matters, right?
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:45.100]   What Paul is saying here, if it is not compelled and ground in love, it can easily lead to
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.100]   that.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:52.220]   It can lead to frustration, feeling judged, or, you know, for doing one thing, or judged
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.180]   if you don't do one thing, and everybody's watching you.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:33:00.780]   Even in practice of grace, right, we're looking at each other, "Who's more gracious?
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.780]   Who's more humble?"
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:02.780]   Right?
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.620]   Because that's what we are.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:11.940]   But again, let me give you a life illustration where I think will help us understand this,
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.940]   right?
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:17.560]   Esser and I love watching action movies, right?
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.900]   We don't go to watch movies to be fed.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.260]   We do quiet time for that, right?
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.940]   So I don't go to movies to be like, "Oh, I want to be stimulated in my intellect."
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.820]   I want to go there and just blow up stuff, right?
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.740]   Just blow up stuff, action.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:39.260]   I want to be awake for a while, and then if it's not, you know, the other benefit is I
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.500]   can sleep, right?
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.660]   So either way, if it's boring, I get to sleep.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.580]   If it's exciting, you know, I get to entertain.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.500]   But ever since we've had kids, you know, we can't just go watch because, you know, a lot
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:56.460]   of these action movies are, you know, even though it may be innocent, younger kids can't
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.060]   watch it.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.500]   So we can't watch.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.340]   We haven't been able to watch these like Avengers and all this stuff, but now that our kids
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.220]   are a bit older, you know, we're starting to able to because now our little kid, he's
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.500]   10, and we've desensitized him to certain things.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.980]   And so he's okay.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.300]   We built up tolerance for him so he can go in, okay?
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.540]   So you can judge me.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.500]   Judge me, okay?
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:28.100]   So we went to watch Spider-Man not too long ago with everybody because, you know, somebody
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.740]   saw it and said, "I think it's safe."
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:30.740]   And then we went to watch.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.260]   What was the latest one?
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.260]   Infinity War.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.260]   Thank you.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.260]   Okay.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.740]   So we took the whole family to watch it, and we were able to enjoy it.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.220]   You know, it came out and we talked about it, and it was kind of like a family bonding
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   time.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.420]   This is our family bonding time, right?
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.420]   And it was great.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:54.780]   We were able to enjoy it, but for all these years, we didn't go.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.180]   Even though Esther and I enjoy watching these movies, and before we had kids, I mean, that's
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.860]   how we spent our time, watching action movies.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:07.460]   But there's a long period of I don't know how many years where we stopped watching it
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.580]   because our kids can't come with us.
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.140]   Now during that period, it was like, "Oh my gosh.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.140]   I have this freedom."
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.960]   There's nothing wrong with this.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.680]   And force them to watch and then be disturbed and have a nightmare.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.400]   That's your problem.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.280]   I have freedom in Christ.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.100]   There's nothing wrong with this, right?
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.340]   I'm being entertained.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.340]   I get to sleep.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.500]   It's good for my health.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.100]   You know, like this is good.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.740]   I don't know any parent who does that.
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:44.180]   Once you have a kid, you're looking out for the benefit of your children.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.100]   Certain things that you would do as an adult that you have clear conscience doing, you
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:52.260]   would stop doing it because of the presence of your children in your life.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.740]   And you do it voluntarily.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:57.780]   And the reason why you do it is because you love them.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:02.260]   Paul is not asking us just to suck it up.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.580]   He's asking us to practice this love.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.020]   See when you take love out of that relationship, then it just becomes like, "Where do we draw
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.020]   the line?
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.340]   Like I got to live for them?"
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:17.900]   And that's why he uses the context of walking in love, to walk in love.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.700]   So don't practice your freedom devoid of the context that you're in.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.700]   To practice the love that Christ has given us.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.460]   First Corinthians 18 to 13, "For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in idols
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:36.860]   temple, will he not be encouraged if his conscience is weak to eat food offered to idols?
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.540]   And so by your knowledge, this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.540]   died.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:47.740]   Thus sinning against your brother and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.020]   against Christ.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.980]   What would have been perfectly innocent, dragging my three-year-old to watch something because
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:59.300]   I wanted to and then destroying him, causing him nightmares, is what he said he can easily
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.300]   lead to sin.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:08.940]   For if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat lest I make my brother stumble."
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:15.060]   This is what it means by destroying your brother with what we consider to be good.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.220]   But there is a bigger part of what he's talking about.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:26.340]   When we destroy not just the individual, if we walk in truth and our actions are actually
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.860]   destroying the brothers and sisters around us, it can actually ultimately destroy the
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:34.900]   church and the witness that God has brought.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.540]   In First Corinthians 3, 16 and 17, it says, "Do you not know that you are God's temple
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.940]   and that God's Spirit dwells in you?"
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.980]   He's saying this because he's frustrated with this church who's practicing truth but dividing
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.900]   the church in their practice.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.020]   If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:58.260]   He's talking about division in the church, he's talking about practicing truth, but they
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.860]   were doing it selfishly, devoid of context.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.740]   And it says God's will burn, God's anger will burn against him.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.520]   God's temple is holy and you are that temple.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:15.380]   A church divided and a church infighting is not concerned about the witness of reaching
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.820]   the lost.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.540]   It just is not.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.060]   All our energy is spent infighting.
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:30.100]   All our energy is spent in just trying to put up with one another.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.580]   A church that's divided is no longer talking about the Great Commission or practicing the
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.540]   Great Commission.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.060]   We don't have the energy to do that.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:43.580]   That's why Paul says in First Corinthians 9, 19-23, "For though I am free from all, I have
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.340]   made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.260]   To the Jews I became as a Jew in order to win the Jew.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.500]   To those under the law I became as one under the law, though not being myself under the
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.300]   law, that I might win those under the law."
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.180]   Let me stop right there.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.300]   Apostle Paul lived this whole life being obedient to the law.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:08.020]   And he had a radical transformation, radical revelation when he met Christ on the road
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.020]   to Damascus.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:15.740]   And now that he's free, he can eat whatever, he can go wherever, he can wear whatever.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.180]   And he was living in freedom.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:23.100]   And all of a sudden he says he's willing to go back into that heavy burden of the law,
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.780]   which Paul says in Galatians.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.360]   We've been freed.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.940]   We don't have to live under this condemnation.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.840]   And so he's experienced this freedom, he's enjoying this freedom, but he says he's willing
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:41.500]   to let go of that for the greater joy of spreading the gospel.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.220]   He's willing to go back and become that Jew.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:49.460]   He was willing to become a Pharisee because he has a bigger picture in mind, God's glory,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.780]   because he knows that ultimate freedom for him is not here.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.580]   That ultimate experience of life is not here.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.160]   He's willing to live in bondage.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.900]   He's willing to let go of his freedom.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:07.380]   He's willing to draw the line way over here for the purpose of building and spreading
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.380]   of the gospel.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.220]   Verse 21, "To those outside the law I became as one outside the law, not being outside
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.460]   the law of God, but under the law of Christ, that I might win those outside the law.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.820]   To the weak I became weak that I might win the weak.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:24.840]   I have become all things to all people that I by all means I might save some.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:31.500]   I do it all for the sake of the gospel that I may share with them in its blessing."
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:38.380]   He took Timothy, who didn't need to be circumcised, and circumcised him.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.360]   This was not a stamp on his hand.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:46.100]   He circumcised him just strictly for the purpose of spreading the gospel.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:52.220]   An immature person is only concerned about the practice of his freedom and how it affects
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.220]   him.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.620]   You know, we hear people say oftentimes, "Oh, I'm a girl.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.620]   I'm a guy.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.620]   I'm an introvert.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.280]   I'm an extrovert.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.620]   I was raised this way, and I'm an Asian, or I'm not an Asian."
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:09.580]   And so we all declare basically, "This is who I am, so don't expect me to change."
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.060]   You know what causes problems in marriage?
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.100]   You have a husband and wife, and the wife says, "Well, this is just how I am," and
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.220]   the husband says, "Well, this is the way I am."
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:24.020]   And so you're looking for somebody who's going to accept you exactly the way you are,
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.940]   and there is nobody, because at the core of it, it's selfishness.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.060]   It's not because you're a woman.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.060]   It's not because you're a guy.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.060]   It's just selfishness.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.740]   This is who I am, so I want you to change for me.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.780]   That's the beginning of a bad marriage.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.740]   A good marriage recognizes, "This is where I am.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.980]   This is where she is, and for her sake, I need to become different.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.720]   For his sake, I need to be different."
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.940]   And that's what Paul means here.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:56.540]   He says, "Mature to practice the truth for the sake of others."
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.980]   Until we empty ourselves of ourselves, we will always be self-centered, and that's why
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:07.460]   the call of Christ is, "He who finds his life," what?
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.820]   "Will lose it."
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:15.300]   If your whole purpose of truth is about you, you will lose it.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:21.140]   He who loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:26.200]   That's the initial call to live, is to die.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.380]   Until we die to ourselves, the cross is not going to make any sense.
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:38.380]   Not only did he die, he told us to die, because only in our death can we walk truly in love.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:43.740]   Even in the context of practicing truth, even when we are theologically correct, it could
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:47.020]   all be about ourselves if we're not careful.
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:53.340]   We can easily win the battle, but lose the war.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:43:02.060]   Many people who have been compelled by this love of Christ, what changed you?
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.900]   What compels you?
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.060]   What motivates you?
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:11.260]   If it is not the love of Christ, this is not something you can do by just willpower, because
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.020]   you want to be a good person.
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.300]   Only those who've been deeply affected will understand.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.300]   I'm going to conclude.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:26.340]   I'm going to read a short passage of a letter that was written by a young communist member
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.740]   in the beginnings of communism, where he was breaking off with his girlfriend because he
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.060]   went off to basically fight for communism.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:38.220]   In this letter, he's explaining to her why he's not coming home.
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:42.320]   Let me read this letter to you, just a portion of it.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.760]   We communists have a high casualty rate.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:50.060]   We are the ones who get shot and hung and ridiculed and fired from our jobs and in every
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.420]   other way, made as uncomfortable as possible.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.780]   A certain percentage of us get killed or imprisoned.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.060]   We live in virtual poverty.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:02.740]   We turn back to the party every penny we make above what is absolutely necessary to keep
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.220]   us alive.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:09.360]   We communists do not have the time or money or many movies or concerts or T-bone steaks
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.780]   or decent homes or new cars.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.220]   We have been described as fanatics.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.660]   We are fanatics.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:22.780]   Our lives are dominated by one great overshadowing factor, the struggle for world communism.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.980]   We communists have a philosophy of life that no amount of money can buy.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.500]   We have a cause to fight for, a definite purpose in life.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.300]   We subordinate our petty personal selves to the great movement of humanity.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.740]   And if our personal lives seem hard or our egos appear to suffer through subordination
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:45.860]   to the party, then we are adequately compensated by the thought that each of us, in a small
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:52.580]   way, is contributing to something new and true and better for mankind.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:58.240]   We read that of communism and a young member who was committed and we may be disturbed.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.740]   This is the reason why communists took off.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:09.260]   It's clearly proven today, even in communist countries, that communism just doesn't work.
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.780]   The communistic philosophy has been proven to be false.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.460]   In fact, more and more communist countries call themselves socialists because it's kind
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:21.620]   of like a halfway compromise without admitting that they failed.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:27.940]   And yet it was this type of commitment, this type of ideology that causes, caused it to
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.900]   catch on fire.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:37.060]   How much more should we consider the truth?
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:43.100]   Not only will it affect this life for eternity, how much of every decision that we make, every
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:51.260]   penny that we spend, everything that we do, that we should consider how it affects eternity
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.700]   and not just here.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:57.280]   And that's exactly what Paul is saying in chapter 14.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:04.980]   To pursue truth in grace and love, to build up the kingdom and not to destroy.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.060]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team comes out.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.240]   (audience applauding)
