[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   - All right, well thank you for having me come
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.160]   and just deliver God's Word for you.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.000]   It really is a joy and a pleasure to just administer
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.640]   to all of you here.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.440]   You guys have been a huge blessing to me personally
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.440]   and to our church.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.760]   I know a lot of our members at our church have friends here
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.880]   and so it's just good to know that there's like a,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.180]   almost like a sister church with which we can labor
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.180]   for the kingdom.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.280]   And you know, I wanna say that I'm so thankful
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.600]   for your pastor.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.560]   Pastor Peter is just an amazing guy.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.980]   I was so humbled that he would ask me to come
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.320]   and minister with him out in India.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.200]   And it's, I love doing ministry out there.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.200]   It was amazing.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.800]   I mean, you saw the update and everything,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800]   but I loved spending time with your pastor.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800]   The guy is hilarious.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.120]   You know, I picked up on some mannerisms,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.960]   but you know, he would say, he would go like this a lot.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   You know, he'd go like this.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.440]   You know, and sometimes he would like,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.680]   like when someone does something dumb,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   he'd be like, wah, wah.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.720]   I don't know if the team told you,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.000]   but you know, there was a time when we were praying
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   as a team.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So three of us were praying.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.680]   And so I saw him pray, another person prayed.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.640]   I closed and prayed.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.160]   And then like, we all done praying
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   and Pastor Peter was like, mm.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.600]   But you know, then he just wakes up,
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.600]   like nothing happened.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.600]   And it's like, oh, you guys done?
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   I'm like, our faithful leader, yes.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   You know, I love Pastor Peter because,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   you know, he doesn't take himself seriously,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.600]   but man, you know, he loves the Lord.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   He loves the Lord.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   He is faithful to the calling of a preacher,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   of a pastor.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   He is faithful in getting the message out.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   He is faithful in getting the gospel out to the nations.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.720]   I mean, hence the trip in India,
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.760]   and the opportunity for guys like me to come alongside.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.560]   And you know, Pastor Peter, over the years,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.440]   I feel like I've gotten to know him a lot more,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.720]   and spend time with him more.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.200]   And he has been to me a mentor.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.480]   And I just think about the ways in which he has blessed me,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.800]   and I can't imagine how much he has blessed you.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.880]   'Cause he is laboring over you,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.160]   week in, week out, in the middle of the week,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.520]   sacrificing, giving.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.720]   And you are truly blessed.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.520]   Not a lot of churches have pastors
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.840]   like the ones you have here.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.800]   I hope you realize that.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.880]   And one of the encouragements I would want to give you
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.880]   is to encourage him.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.000]   Let him know how much you appreciate all the sacrifice,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.560]   all the work he's been doing,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.960]   along with the leaders here at this church.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.160]   And minister to them.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.920]   A lot of times people think that pastors are impervious to sin,
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.200]   and impervious to struggles.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.160]   But he is a sinner, he is a man,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.520]   and if you can encourage him,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.480]   man, that will be a blessing.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   It just comes back to you.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.120]   Write him a letter, take him out for dinner,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.560]   or get him a gift card or something.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.040]   Bless him, and I know he will be deeply encouraged
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.480]   by the way in which you appreciate him.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.200]   But as I was thinking about what to preach today,
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.320]   one of the things I was thinking about
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.160]   is how I can bless Pastor Peter,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.360]   and at the same time challenge you guys.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.480]   And so I thought it would be great for me to preach
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.120]   on the book of Titus, Titus chapter two, verse one.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.360]   So if you take your Bibles,
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.880]   turn with me to Titus chapter two, verse one,
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   and then I'll open us up in a time of prayer.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.440]   Titus chapter two, verse one.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.720]   I'll read it again.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.680]   Pray with me.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.720]   Dear God, we think about doctrine.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.000]   We think about theology.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.120]   We think about your word,
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.560]   the revelation that comes from heaven.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.800]   And God, we know that in it is the answer to life.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.680]   In it is the path to salvation.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.840]   In it is the path to have a relationship with you.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.520]   And Father, we are humbled that we are able to read
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.000]   and to understand and to be taught truths
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.240]   that proceed from the heights of heaven.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.400]   God, it's so easy to look at the Bible
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.040]   and to just treat it like any other book
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.400]   because it looks so unassuming,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.680]   just words written upon a page.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.160]   But we know within its pages is the power of God
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.920]   for the salvation of man to those who believe.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   I pray that we will understand the weightiness
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.400]   of what we have in our hands,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.200]   that we will be a people who submit to the word
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.680]   because we know in submitting to the word,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.320]   we are submitting to the king who gives us his word.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.720]   God, we pray this in the name of your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.560]   Amen.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.600]   Now, preachers follow a long line of men
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.720]   who have preached the word of God,
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.880]   guarding doctrinal truths from error,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.960]   recovering doctrinal truths from the morass
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.800]   of human traditions and philosophies,
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.480]   and disseminating doctrinal truths
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.280]   for the salvation of man.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.640]   The Apostle Paul in the first century
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.160]   established the truth of the gospel
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.800]   throughout the Roman Empire.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.360]   Irenaeus defended the gospel truth
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.880]   against the Gnostic heresies in the second century.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.720]   Athanasius in the fourth century
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.800]   guarded the deity of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.560]   John Hus in the 15th century fought for Christ's headship
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.920]   over against that of the Pope.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.640]   Luther in the 16th century recovered the gospel
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.120]   from the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.720]   Edwards in the 18th century profoundly developed
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.160]   the doctrines of scripture.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.920]   And Spurgeon in the 19th century
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.080]   preached the doctrines of scripture with fire.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.000]   And in the 20th century,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.200]   Lloyd-Jones exposited it with much clarity.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.400]   I think about that long line of faithful men
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.640]   who have delivered the word of God unashamedly,
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.920]   and your pastors here in this church
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.200]   follow in that long line of men.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.960]   What they do, what your pastors do,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.040]   what the preacher does from this pulpit
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.400]   is no less significant than the great saints
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.960]   of the past because the same power
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.040]   that surged through the lips of Luther
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.120]   pulses through theirs as they proclaim
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.120]   about the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.880]   When they speak about the word of God,
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.120]   the souls of men are resurrected from the dead.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.320]   They're forgiven of their sins.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.240]   The guilty are justified before a holy God,
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.920]   and the Holy Spirit dwells within man.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.400]   And that is no small thing.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.040]   The task of the preacher is to communicate
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.520]   the word of the living God,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.720]   so that through that proclamation,
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.520]   the elect might come to salvation,
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.080]   that those who are saved might grow in their faith.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.240]   As we come, as we study this text
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.520]   in Titus chapter two, verse one,
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.880]   there's a simple lesson that many of you guys know already,
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.520]   and it's this, the responsibility of the preacher
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.640]   to preach the word of God.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   It's a simple point.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.440]   I mean, it's just only one verse, right?
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.800]   The responsibility of the preacher
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.560]   to preach the word of God.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.800]   But there's three applications I want to draw from this.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.580]   Okay, three applications I want to draw from this.
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.220]   First, to listen to a message for depth, okay?
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.260]   To listen to a message for depth.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.460]   Secondly, to listen to a message for the sake of God.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.920]   To listen to a message for the sake of God.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.940]   And lastly, to listen to a message
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.940]   for the sake of the community.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.700]   The role of the preacher is to preach,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.980]   but that doesn't mean you just sit there idly.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.560]   As a congregation, you have a responsibility before God.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.580]   You need to worship God in listening to the word.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.480]   And so listen to a message for depth,
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.420]   listen to a message for the sake of God,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.120]   and listen to a message for the sake of the community.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.640]   Let's read verse one.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.820]   The responsibility of the preacher
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.660]   to preach the word of God, verse one.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.580]   But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.220]   As for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.860]   In this section, the apostle Paul
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.580]   contrasts the false teachers with Titus.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.140]   Look at Titus chapter one, verse 13 to 16.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.800]   It says, "This testimony is true.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.920]   "Therefore rebuke them sharply
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.700]   "that they may be sound in the faith,
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.540]   "not devoting themselves to Jewish myths
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.560]   "and the commands of people who turn away from the truth.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.960]   "To the pure, all things are pure,
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.200]   "but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.120]   "But both their minds and their conscience are defiled.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.100]   "They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.400]   "They are detestable, disobedient,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.480]   "unfit for any good work.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.160]   "The legalists from the circumcision party
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.640]   "distorted the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.420]   "saying that the death and the resurrection of Jesus
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.320]   "is not enough for salvation, it's not sufficient.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.040]   "But they themselves need to contribute
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.760]   "to the work of salvation."
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.600]   Now in contrast to their false teaching
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.880]   and to their false work,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.320]   the apostle Paul commissions Titus, calls Titus,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   "You preach sound doctrine."
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.720]   And when he addresses Titus, he is emphatic.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.680]   He's emphatic and he says, "But you yourself, Titus,
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.620]   "you yourself teach what is true, teach what is right.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.960]   "They manipulate, they deceive, they endanger,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.820]   "but you teach according to what is true to the scriptures.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.400]   "Teach sound doctrine."
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.440]   This is the calling of a pastor,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.800]   the calling of another, the calling,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.120]   the responsibility of an overseer of the church.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.840]   The reason why this is so imperative,
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.440]   the reason why Paul is emphatic,
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.640]   is because lives are at stake.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.060]   False teaching infects the soul,
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.160]   and if that infection is not cut off,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.320]   then that soul will be damned to hell.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.560]   Therefore, teach sound doctrine.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.800]   But even more serious than the threat of damnation
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.360]   is the threat upon the glory of God.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.760]   Listen to Titus chapter one, verse 16.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.960]   It says, "They profess to know God,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.600]   "but they deny him by their works."
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.420]   Their ascetic works, their manipulative works,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.720]   which accords with perverse teachings,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.680]   denies the God of the Christian faith.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.040]   They misrepresent God,
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.720]   make him out to be someone that he's not.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.320]   A God whose love must be earned and worked for.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.960]   A God whose promises are uncertain
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   because it's dependent upon man.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.040]   A God who rejects the sufficiency of his own son.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.120]   He rejects the crucifixion of Jesus Christ upon the cross.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.800]   Is that our God?
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.600]   Is that Yahweh?
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.200]   And so the apostle Paul tells Titus,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.100]   "You teach sound doctrine.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.000]   "Teach what is consistent with who our God is.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.400]   "Teach what is consistent with what he has done.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.800]   "Teach what is consistent with his character."
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.280]   The preacher's responsibility
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.680]   is to proclaim biblical truth.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.160]   He must teach the entirety of the Bible.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.220]   He must talk about the reality of the fall,
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.960]   the reality of sin, the judgment of hell,
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.920]   the weakness of man, the coming of Jesus,
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.880]   the sacrifice of Jesus, the damnation of Jesus,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.240]   the burial of Jesus, the resurrection of Jesus,
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.440]   and the return of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.480]   Because only by the proclamation of truth
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.680]   will lives be saved.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.480]   Because the gospel is the power of God
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.120]   for the salvation of mankind.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.460]   And only by the proclamation of truth
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.200]   will people be sanctified.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.400]   Because the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.280]   is the emanation of the glory of God,
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.720]   and it's the glory of God that sanctifies us.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.840]   And only by the proclamation of the truth
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.000]   will the church be reminded to wait for the king
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.080]   who is going to return, all for the glory of God.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.000]   First Corinthians 1.22-24 says,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.680]   "For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.360]   "But we preach Christ crucified,
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.860]   "a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.640]   "But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks,
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.120]   "Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.680]   Woe to the preacher who does not preach the gospel.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.760]   One of the reasons why I'm so grateful for this church
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.440]   is because I know the word of God proceeds
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.360]   from this pulpit.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.240]   That's why I'm grateful for this ministry here.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.600]   I know from this pulpit here, God is glorified.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.760]   And it's all about God.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.920]   But you know, that's not the case with a lot of churches.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.080]   You know, I feel to be such a sad thing
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   when pastors, overseers of the church,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.960]   neglect to fulfill Titus chapter two, one,
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.120]   because they're more concerned about being popular
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.520]   and entertaining the people.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.120]   And I know some of you guys come from that background.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.600]   Some of you guys come from a background
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.080]   where the word of God has not been preached.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.200]   And you know firsthand the dangers
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.880]   that results from that kind of culture,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.640]   that kind of church.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.800]   Because then you find people who've been going out
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.000]   to church their entire lives,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.500]   they don't even know who Christ is.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.560]   They don't even know what the gospel is.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.360]   It's such a tragic thing, and not only a tragic thing,
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.600]   but a perverse thing, when professors of Christianity
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.320]   wind up in hell because sound doctrine is crucified,
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.440]   all for the sake of entertainment,
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   and of all people, by the preachers.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.920]   Second Timothy in four three says,
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   "For the time is coming when people
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.040]   "will not endure sound teaching,
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.860]   "but having itching ears, they will accumulate
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.560]   "for themselves teachers to suit their own passions."
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.320]   For the time is coming when the people
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.280]   will not endure sound teaching,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.980]   but having itching ears, they will accumulate
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.520]   for themselves teachers to suit their own passions.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.040]   The church here is not a circus,
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.840]   and the pastor a clown, and the word of God just a show.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.160]   This place is a hospital, and the preacher is the surgeon,
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.720]   and the scalpel that he uses is a double-edged
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   blade of the word of God.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.880]   With it, he cuts into the soul,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.960]   and he takes out the tumor of your sin.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.000]   To do anything less endangers the soul,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.120]   because when the word of God is not preached faithfully,
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.600]   sin is minimized.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.500]   When sin is minimized, the need for salvation is diminished.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.200]   When the need for salvation is diminished,
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.800]   the power of the gospel is overlooked.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.640]   When the power of the gospel is overlooked,
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.480]   souls are damned to hell.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.080]   A preacher who fails to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.600]   a preacher who fails to preach the word of God,
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.880]   is a preacher who fails in his responsibility
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.580]   towards his fellow man, and towards his savior.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.880]   Souls and glory is both at stake
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.480]   in the proclamation of sound doctrine.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.400]   It's for this reason why the apostle Paul
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.120]   gives this serious charge, not only to Titus,
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.000]   but he gives it also to Timothy.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.040]   Second Timothy chapter four, verse one through two.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.240]   Take your Bibles and turn with me
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.940]   to Second Timothy chapter four, verse one through two.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.100]   (silence)
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:06.060]   Second Timothy chapter four, verse one through two.
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.900]   Listen to what God says, listen to him.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:17.100]   I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.820]   who is to judge the living and the dead,
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.880]   and by his appearing and his kingdom,
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.180]   preach the word, be ready in season and out of season,
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.540]   reprove, rebuke, and exhort
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.700]   with complete patience and teaching.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.620]   Paul charges the preachers in the presence of God
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.140]   and of Christ Jesus to preach.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.420]   But look, he doesn't say Jesus Christ, the savior, right?
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.860]   He doesn't say that.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.040]   He doesn't say Jesus, the merciful one, the patient one,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.220]   but he says, look at the text,
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.980]   Jesus, the judge of the living and the dead.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.520]   The one before whom the preacher is called
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.920]   to proclaim the gospel is before the judge
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.620]   who judges and damns souls of men.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.380]   The great judge of all judges.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.640]   The one to fear in this pulpit is not man, but it is God.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.460]   What's man gonna do to you if you preach a sermon
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.780]   that offends him?
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.060]   You know, blog about you?
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.860]   Better to be blogged about than to be found unfaithful
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.880]   before the judge.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.260]   It's not about entertaining people,
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.420]   it's ultimately about our God.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.020]   It's not about making people laugh,
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.860]   it's ultimately about glorifying the savior.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.520]   At the end of the day, what needs to happen
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.360]   from this pulpit, and I know what happens from this pulpit,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.760]   is that the word of God is faithfully proclaimed.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.680]   And for that, I am grateful.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   That's why it is my privilege and my joy
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.360]   to be laboring alongside this church here.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.920]   And the reason for why I'm so grateful for your pastors
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.880]   and your leaders here in this ministry.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.540]   That's their responsibility.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.160]   But you have a responsibility as a congregation.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.140]   You have a responsibility to listen.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.320]   To listen worshipfully.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.220]   Not because what proceeds from my lips
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.380]   is the words of James, or the words of Pastor Peter.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.740]   Because the words that proceed from this pulpit
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.540]   ultimately proceeds from heaven,
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.900]   so as long as the word of God is exposited.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.020]   So it's a responsibility on behalf of the congregation
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.560]   to listen to the word of God worshipfully.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.780]   And so the first application I have for you
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.100]   is to listen to the message for depth.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.820]   Listen to a message for depth.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:25.260]   Some of you here, I know not all of you,
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.220]   I would even venture to say only a few of you,
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.860]   few of you need to develop a palate
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.380]   for the deep doctrines of God.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.780]   You need to listen to the word of God
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.360]   for your own personal growth.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.180]   Some of you, or a few of you,
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.900]   have a hard time swallowing biblical truths.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.820]   You have a hard time listening to a message
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.780]   unless it is sugar-coated with a lot of jokes and stories.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.260]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.620]   And just a whole bunch of stories,
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.620]   that's the only way to keep you awake,
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.580]   only to keep you interested.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.380]   Spurgeon, he says this, he says,
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.460]   "It is bitter, say you,
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.960]   "when we bring the honey of the gospel.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.980]   "It is not the honey that is bitter, it is your mouth."
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.340]   He's so sassy, I love it.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.140]   "It is your mouth that is out of order."
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.620]   How often people ought to recollect this
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.060]   when they hear a true gospel sermon.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.100]   George Herbert says, "Judge not the preacher,
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.100]   "he is thy judge."
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.260]   And very often when the man who has condemned the sermon,
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.940]   he has far better condemned himself.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.420]   He has not agreed with it, no.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.180]   If he had, it would not have been true.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.620]   The reason why it's so hard for some of you
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.740]   to listen to biblical teachings
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.140]   is because your love for Jesus Christ
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.780]   is weak and shriveled up.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.100]   It's clear, that's straight up what it is.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.460]   And you know what it's like
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.420]   when you're trying to learn something
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.580]   that you're not interested in?
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.940]   You guys know what it's like?
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.820]   You guys sit through lectures,
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.780]   lectures you have no interest in, it's painful.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.420]   It's sleep inducing, you gotta suffer through it.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.460]   But if you love something,
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.620]   and regardless of how hard it might be,
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.740]   you're gonna strive to know it,
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.980]   to experience it, to grow in it.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.740]   Now someone who loves nature,
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.540]   if you love nature, you're not gonna be satisfied
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.540]   with just walking in the park,
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.140]   strolling along the park.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.500]   You wanna climb mountains,
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.180]   even though it's gonna be excruciating and painful.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.220]   Like someone who loves science
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.140]   is not gonna be satisfied
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.460]   with the ASAP science videos from YouTube.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.620]   You're gonna study the subject
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.540]   that you're interested in,
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.220]   maybe pursue a PhD in it.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.260]   Someone who loves literature
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.380]   is not gonna be satisfied with comic strips,
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.020]   but they're gonna wanna read novels,
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.420]   classics, over and over again.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.180]   Things that are interesting and exciting,
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.980]   you will love it.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.460]   So when you hear about the mystery of the Trinity,
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.780]   and the duality of the Christological nature,
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.580]   when you hear about the glory of redemption,
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.820]   when you hear about the grace of death,
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.260]   the power of the resurrection,
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.020]   when you read about the hope of return,
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.060]   the battle of Armageddon,
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.620]   the recreation of heaven and earth,
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.580]   and the descent of the new Jerusalem,
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.820]   and you have a hard time tasting
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.340]   the sweetness of these doctrines,
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.620]   you don't need more jokes,
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.900]   you need more love for Christ.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.940]   That's what you need.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.500]   So you need to examine your own life,
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.340]   and you need to think,
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.980]   have I been meditating upon the gospel?
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.380]   Have I been thinking about the sacrifice of my Savior?
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.900]   Have I been thinking about my own wretchedness,
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.740]   my own sinfulness,
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.540]   and how much he has loved me,
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.260]   that he would die for me?
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.740]   Have I been communing with my God,
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.780]   the God who's throne to which I can come boldly?
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.340]   Because if you have,
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.700]   the truth of the gospel will draw out love from your heart,
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.500]   and that love will cause you to seek
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.220]   and experience your Savior even more
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.780]   from every single message that is preached,
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.380]   because you know in the proclamation of the truth of God,
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.380]   you get another glimpse into his heart.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:41.500]   May you develop a palate for the deep things of God, amen?
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.700]   Now the rest of you,
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.140]   you know that the goal of preaching
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.300]   is not to be entertained or superficially engaged,
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.300]   which is why you're here at this church.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.620]   You come here for depth.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.380]   You come here for things that are true, profundity.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.580]   But there's an application for you as well.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.740]   In the same way as people who want
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.180]   to have their ears tickled,
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.740]   faithful people can come to church mainly for themselves.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.820]   Faithful people can come to church mainly for themselves.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.500]   They might not come to hear something superficial,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.380]   but they come for themselves nonetheless.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.700]   By default, we are self-focused,
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.860]   because we're sinners.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.300]   We think about ourselves,
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.260]   and so we filter things through how it can apply to us,
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.860]   how it impacts us.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.940]   You know, for example,
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.580]   I've heard people respond to sermons like,
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.380]   you know, I was blessed by it.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.940]   Thank you, pastor, I was blessed by it,
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.860]   or it was really helpful for me.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.940]   I wish somebody told me that before.
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.300]   Right, oh man, I really needed to hear that.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.740]   These are things I hear.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.780]   I also hear, man, yeah, it was okay.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.620]   It was okay, but I already knew that.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.060]   It didn't really resonate with me.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.860]   Oh yeah, you know, the sermon was good,
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.820]   but you know, that's more for the young people.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.260]   Or it's more for the single people,
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.180]   or for the married people, for the old people.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.220]   It wasn't for me, you know,
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.140]   it's more, you know, tailored towards them.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.540]   In short, we listen to our sermon for ourselves.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.900]   And this is not necessarily wrong,
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.420]   but if you're listening mainly for yourself,
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.380]   then you're missing out on a big part
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.340]   of the purpose of preaching,
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.980]   which is not you, but God.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.460]   Now, let me give a quick illustration.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.300]   Imagine if,
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.340]   imagine if someone blogged about me, okay?
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.660]   It just happened in the past.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.900]   (laughs)
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.020]   That's when you know you're legit,
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.100]   you know, people blog about you.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.180]   (audience laughs)
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.500]   And so, let's say someone was blogging about me,
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.140]   and just saying all these terrible things.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.100]   Now, Pastor James is teaching heresy,
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.060]   he's dividing up the church, he left his family.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.540]   And they're just blogging all these things,
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.460]   and people are hearing it,
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.260]   it's like, oh my goodness gracious,
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.980]   you know, Pastor James, unfaithful.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.220]   (audience laughs)
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.780]   And so, you know, every time they see me,
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.100]   they avoid me, they feel all uncomfortable around me.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.700]   And then finally, one of my friends says,
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.020]   I had enough, I'm writing my own blog.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.260]   You know, and then he defends me,
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.740]   he tells me what's true.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.100]   And then finally, my name gets cleared up.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.380]   And then one of these guys come up to me,
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.540]   and says, Pastor G, I'm so glad your name got cleared up,
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.820]   because when people were thinking all these things
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.500]   about you, avoiding you, man, it made my life so hard.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.620]   It made my life so inconvenient.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.900]   I had to exert a lot of energy to avoid you,
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.660]   and when I was around you, man, I felt so uncomfortable,
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.020]   so I'm glad that things got cleared up for me.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:24.860]   (audience laughs)
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.700]   Right?
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.940]   What if, what if they, I go,
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.220]   whew, whew, blog about this, now,
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.220]   (laughs)
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.060]   Right?
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.940]   What if that were to happen?
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.340]   I'd be like, what?
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.260]   As much as all the bad things had happened to me
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.580]   affected you, the issue is really what had happened to me.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.140]   And my friend who came to my defense,
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.180]   who told people what is true,
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.020]   and even though he knew all these things
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.980]   were happening to me, it didn't affect our relationship,
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.140]   because he already knew what was true about me.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.220]   It didn't affect our relationship.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.620]   And, but it was still relevant to him.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.540]   It was still relevant to him.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.460]   And that's how it needs to be with us and our God.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.640]   The world is denying our God.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.280]   The world is blaspheming our God.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.620]   The world is laughing at his commands.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.020]   The world is looking at the cross of Jesus Christ
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.980]   and saying it's nonsense, that it's foolishness.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:25.380]   And all we care about is the vindication of God's name,
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.060]   the exaltation of his glory.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.740]   What, for us?
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.060]   Are we the main issue?
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.580]   Are we the main focus?
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.580]   How often do we hear the vindication of God's name,
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.820]   the proclamation of his character,
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.380]   preaching of his work, and think more about ourselves,
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.500]   instead of thinking I'm glad that right things
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.220]   were being spoken about my God.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.500]   How many of you guys think like that?
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540]   I'm glad that my God was honored.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.980]   I'm glad that my Savior was glorified.
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.220]   I'm glad that the things of God
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.780]   was faithfully communicated.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.420]   Even though it doesn't affect our relationship,
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.300]   because I know who he is.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.940]   I know what he has done.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.020]   I know his love for me.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.500]   It doesn't affect our relationship,
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.380]   but I'm glad the one that I love,
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.940]   his name is being proclaimed truthfully.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.060]   By default, we are self-focused.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.180]   Some might even say self-centered.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.260]   So it's natural to listen to a message for ourselves.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.380]   What can I get from this?
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.380]   What can I learn?
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.700]   What do I need to change from this?
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.860]   But I want you to think beyond yourself,
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.260]   to think about our God and evaluate
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.140]   whether preaching of a message is faithful
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.620]   to who he is and what he has done,
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.020]   and whether he is pleased with it.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.420]   Because he's more important than you.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:42.100]   Was the preacher faithful to the text?
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.620]   Above everything, above everyone,
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.740]   above myself was God honored.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.940]   That is the way you need to begin to think.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.700]   There are going to be messages that you listen to,
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.660]   and you're already gonna know that lesson,
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.980]   that theology and that doctrine.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.580]   There are gonna be messages you listen to
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.740]   that's not gonna resonate with you
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.420]   in that particular stage of life.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.820]   There's gonna be messages you listen to,
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.060]   and there's gonna be no application to it.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.140]   And you're gonna struggle through it
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.260]   if the purpose of the message is ultimately about you.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.780]   But if it's about God, and God matters to us
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.820]   because he has loved us and sent his son to die for us,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.140]   then it's not gonna matter
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.380]   if there is no direct application in your life.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.580]   You're gonna praise God because what is true
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.100]   about God has been proclaimed.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.700]   You know, I'm glad people come up to me.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.820]   I am encouraged.
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.420]   I don't wanna say I'm not encouraged
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.620]   when people come up to me and tell me
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.420]   how blessed they are by the sermons.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:37.260]   But I would be just as happy and joyful,
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.660]   if not more, if those people said,
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.900]   "Thank you for preaching what is right about my savior.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.780]   "Thank you for caring more about his name
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.240]   "than entertaining the people.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.180]   "Thank you."
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.020]   And so here's my exhortation to you, okay?
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.260]   I don't know if Pastor Peter's gonna listen to this.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.620]   Cut off the beginning, you know?
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.860]   (laughing)
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.340]   But when he comes back,
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.500]   thank him for what he has done for God.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.060]   Say, "Thank you for speaking rightly
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.360]   "about the God who I worship.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.060]   "Thank you for being faithful to the truth."
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.940]   You know, and encourage him in that way
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.740]   because the focus now, 'cause now you're reminding him too,
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.340]   yeah, it's not about them.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.220]   It's not about us ultimately.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.700]   It's ultimately about our God,
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.620]   and I'm grateful that my congregation understands that.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.900]   What a joy it is for a pastor to hear that.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.820]   So encourage him with those words.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.460]   I encourage him with those words.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.420]   Now, second application I wanna give
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.620]   is to listen to a message for the sake of the community,
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.180]   or this is the third one.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.480]   Listen to a message for the sake of community.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.460]   As we move on from verse one,
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.980]   the Apostle Paul does not call Titus
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.500]   to address the Christian community on Crete as a whole,
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.260]   but he tells him to address specific types of people.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.260]   Look at the text and read with me from verse two to verse nine.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.100]   Titus chapter two,
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.580]   let's just read from verse one to verse nine.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.740]   Titus chapter two, verse one to verse nine.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.220]   "Then I ask for you,
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.420]   "teach what accords with sound doctrine.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.680]   "Older men are to be sober-minded,
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.900]   "dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith and love,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.420]   "and in steadfastness.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.820]   "Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior,
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.820]   "not slanders or slaves to much wine.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.220]   "They're to teach what is good,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.300]   "and so train the young women
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.680]   "to love their husbands and children,
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.620]   "to be self-controlled, pure, working at home,
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.580]   "kind and submissive to their own husbands,
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.800]   "that the word of God may not be reviled.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.380]   "Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.880]   "Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.020]   "and in your teaching, show integrity, dignity,
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.300]   "and sound speech that cannot be condemned
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.460]   "so that an opponent may be put to shame,
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.540]   "having nothing evil to say about us.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.800]   "Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.940]   "and everything they are to be well-pleasing,
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.740]   "not argumentative."
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.860]   So in verse two, he addresses older men.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.980]   In verse three, he addresses older women.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.420]   Verse four through five, he addresses young women.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.380]   In verse six, he addresses younger men.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.020]   In verse seven through eight, he addresses Titus directly.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.220]   And lastly, in verse nine, he addresses slaves.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.320]   That's a very important lesson for us to learn
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.940]   just from this fact.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.140]   We are not only to listen to a message for our own souls.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.900]   We are not only to listen to a message for the sake of God,
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.640]   but we are also to listen to a message
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.320]   for the sake of the community.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.080]   There are times when a message,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.720]   when messages are directed specifically
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.240]   to a group of people you are not a part.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   So it's not gonna have any practical relevance to you.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.620]   But you need to be able to listen to that message,
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.640]   not so much with yourself in mind,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.240]   but with the entire community in mind.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.480]   And this is especially true for this ministry
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.240]   here at Berean.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.040]   You know, our church at Cross Life,
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   we're like your little brothers.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.580]   I don't know.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.240]   'Cause we're smaller, we're younger.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   And yeah, so we're just like a miniature version
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.080]   of following you along.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:13.660]   So the target group at my church is maybe 18 to,
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.500]   I don't know, we got 17 year olds, crazy.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.040]   So we got 17 year olds, and dude,
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.640]   I'm the oldest one there at the church.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.720]   (laughing)
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.840]   So I'm the old dude.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.600]   And so that's the range we got.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.480]   Late teens, early 30s.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.760]   And so when I preach a sermon,
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.400]   it's not hard to hit that target.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.680]   But here at Berean, you have youth group,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.640]   man, you got youth group kids through high school,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.600]   you got collegians and people in their 20s,
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.840]   all the way into their like 50s, 60s, I think, right?
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.900]   So you got people, the range is broad.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.120]   So when a message is being preached,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   it's not gonna hit all of you.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.920]   It's not gonna get to all of you.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.040]   And so it's important for you to develop a discipline
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.880]   of listening to a message communally,
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.440]   and to think about how the word of God
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.880]   will work through the lives of people
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.200]   who might not know that doctrine,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.000]   even though you might know that doctrine,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.480]   or how an instruction is gonna help someone
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.340]   who is young in the faith,
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.640]   even though you might be mature in the faith,
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.720]   or how that rebuke is gonna wake someone up,
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.440]   even though you have been faithful.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.760]   I don't want you to miss out on what God is doing
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.680]   in this church through the power of this word,
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.560]   as he is saving people, as he is growing people,
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.800]   strengthening people, healing people,
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.520]   all because you're just so consumed
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.220]   on whether or not the passage is relevant for you.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.020]   Think bigger than yourself,
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.180]   and rejoice in what God is doing outside of you.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.900]   Titus chapter two, verse 11 through 14, listen to this.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.240]   For the grace of God has appeared,
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.400]   bringing salvation for all people,
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.560]   training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions,
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.960]   and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.320]   in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.080]   and the appearing of the glory of our great God
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.840]   and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.920]   to redeem us from all lawlessness
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.960]   and to purify for himself a people for his own possession
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   who are zealous for good works.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.240]   The grace of God is for all people.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.040]   We must open up our eyes to see how that grace
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.560]   is working not only in our own lives,
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.200]   but in the lives of the members here at this church.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.200]   I have a friend, his name is Steve,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.440]   and he's a full-time tutor, but he's trying
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.320]   to start a business, an after-school prep course.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.640]   And he was telling me about the challenges
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.160]   going from a tutoring context to that of a classroom.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.560]   And he was saying when he was tutoring,
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.320]   it was easier because he can custom tailor
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.840]   every single lesson to the students.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.640]   If things were too hard, he would just slow down.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.800]   If things were too easy, he would just pick up the pace.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.000]   But in a classroom, it was much more difficult
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.880]   because you can teach a lesson, and one kid might get it,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.280]   but the other kids might not.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.200]   But if you slow down, that kid is gonna get boring for him,
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.360]   but if you keep up at the same pace,
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.320]   you're gonna lose everybody else.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.640]   And he was sharing this with me,
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.640]   and I understood the sentiment
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.000]   because that's one of the challenges that pastors have.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   But can you imagine a classroom where Steve's students
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.720]   are willing to help each other out,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.020]   to help each other out with physics and chemistry?
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.100]   The students who are able to understand things faster
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.040]   take the time to teach those who are slower.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.440]   And in teaching them, they master the material.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.280]   And the students who are receiving the help
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.200]   and receiving the tutoring from their peers
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.680]   obviously grow in their understanding as well.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.120]   Now does this require the smarter kids to make sacrifices?
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.920]   Absolutely, and absolutely.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.400]   But it doesn't mean that they themselves
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.740]   aren't gonna get anything from it,
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.840]   because now as a whole, they move forward towards their goal.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.640]   And this kind of communal growth can happen in the church
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.680]   because it's not about the individual.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.120]   It's the church, it's about the community.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.080]   Take your Bibles and turn with me to Ephesians 4,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.180]   verse one to 13.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:47.720]   Or 11 to 13, sorry.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.920]   Ephesians 4, verse 11 to verse 13.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:33:00.880]   Ephesians 4, verse 11 to verse 13.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.240]   It says, "And he gave the apostles, the prophets,
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.580]   "the evangelists, the shepherds, and teachers
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.980]   "to equip the saints for the work of the ministry,
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.080]   "for the building up the body of Christ,"
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.480]   listen to this, "until we all attain
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.060]   "to the unity of the faith
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.360]   "and the knowledge of the Son of God,
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.480]   "to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.420]   "of the fullness of Christ."
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.880]   You guys catch that?
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.700]   "He gave the apostles, prophets, evangelists,
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.860]   "shepherds, and teachers to equip you
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.180]   "so that you all might attain to the unity of the faith,
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.140]   "to mature manhood, to the knowledge of the Son of God."
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:47.580]   My Mexican professor, Dr. Montoya,
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.500]   he used to always say this.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.500]   He used to say, "Juno, there's something romantic
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.820]   "about a lone wolf howling into the night,
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.620]   "howling into the full moon, ah-hoo-hoo!"
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:07.300]   But you know, a lone wolf is a dead wolf,
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.860]   because the strength of a wolf is the pack,
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.980]   strength of the pack is the wolf.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.860]   I was like, oh, that's good.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.360]   I'm taking that.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.580]   But it's true, it's true.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.940]   You are not lone wolves here, you're not.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.260]   You are one pack, you are the Berean pack.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.660]   You move together, you hunt together, you fight together.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.060]   So learn to grow together, help each other,
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.340]   to minister to each other, to teach each other,
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.860]   and to even listen to a message for each other,
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.260]   and not just for yourself.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:51.020]   As you guys are growing, there are gonna be people
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.140]   who are younger than you in the faith,
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.300]   and it's the responsibility for the older people
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.940]   to begin to teach and to train them up,
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.060]   and to listen not only for yourself,
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.100]   but for everyone, for those who are younger in the faith.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.380]   As you guys are listening to a message
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.220]   that goes over your head, you have to know
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.620]   that it is going to your older brothers and sisters,
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.180]   and they're gonna take in that knowledge,
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.340]   and even though you might not necessarily understand it,
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.580]   it's going to bless them,
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.740]   and that blessing is gonna overflow to you.
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.780]   The responsibility of the preacher,
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.260]   responsibility of the preacher,
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.020]   is to faithfully preach the word of God,
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.860]   to preach sound doctrine.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.140]   But church, it is your responsibility
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.060]   to listen to that sound doctrine worshipfully.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.500]   May God's blessing be upon you guys.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.340]   Let's pray.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:44.860]   Our Lord, we think about your word,
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.700]   and truly it is the power of God for salvation.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.820]   For there is no power in this world
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.100]   that justifies sinners before man,
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.000]   no power that resurrects men from the dead,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.500]   no power that saves people from hell.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.740]   There is no power like the power of the gospel,
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.500]   and I pray that we would understand that power,
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.780]   and to know that as we listen to the word of God
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.220]   that has saved us, the word of God
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.780]   that continues to sanctify us progressively,
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.860]   or that we would do it worshipfully,
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.300]   knowing that the power proceeds ultimately from you,
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.780]   the giver of the word.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.220]   I pray for your blessings upon this church.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.100]   I pray for the congregation,
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.620]   that as they receive the word of God from this pulpit,
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.520]   they would do so worshipfully.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.920]   They would do so looking for depth.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.220]   They would do so listening for your glory.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.640]   They would do so listening for this community.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.940]   Again, would your blessings be upon
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.400]   my brothers and sisters here.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.040]   Pray this in Christ's name, amen.
