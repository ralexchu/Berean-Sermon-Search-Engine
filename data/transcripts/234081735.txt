[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We're looking at Revelation chapter 12 today.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Okay.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:24.240]   I feel like I don't think, I think I haven't taught in like over a month, right?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.680]   It's been more than a month, maybe about five weeks.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.780]   Yeah, I was really out of it.
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.680]   So last two, three days I was just cramming and going back and reviewing everything.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.800]   And then even today I wanted to make sure because again, Revelations is one of those
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.560]   things that you, of course you can get things out of it if you jump in the middle, but you
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.080]   know, you're going to get a lot more out of it if you understand the flow and like the
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.740]   context of where we're at.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.720]   So what I actually want to do is I know Pastor Mark did review, but I want to just go over
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.000]   like the textual review, what we went through and just real quickly, I'm not going to go
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.640]   anywhere near what we did the last time we met, but just so that we can jump in, when
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.560]   we jump in chapter 12, like we can understand the flow of what's happening.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.560]   Okay.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.960]   So this is not in your notes.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.000]   The notes aren't, isn't going to start until a little bit later.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.440]   Okay.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.660]   So remember chapter one, just to kind of give you a review.
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.200]   So if you have your Bibles, I recommend that you open up your Bibles and turn to chapter
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.040]   one, just kind of look at it while we're going through it.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.960]   And then some of these pictures will trigger your memory.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.600]   So chapter one, you have, John is given a vision of the throne of God and who Christ
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   is right.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.240]   And that's the beginning of all the revelation where Jesus himself is speaking to him.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.200]   And so that's the beginning of chapter one, right?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.080]   And then he's the, Christ walks among the seven lambs, and the seven lambs represents
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.480]   the church that he has intimate knowledge of the church, right?
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.960]   So chapter two and three are the seven churches that we talked about.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.600]   Okay.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.160]   So remember, after that chapter four, again, John is given the throne, a vision of the
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.440]   throne in one other place where God, before he calls him into ministry, where God reveals
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.960]   himself or shows a vision of himself before he's actually enters into ministry.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.720]   Kind of like Ezekiel, you guys remember, right?
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.200]   Isaiah, before he's called into prophesy.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.440]   So it's kind of like a pattern, like before God sends him out, he shows them the vision
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   of who he is.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.760]   And basically that's what he does with his disciples.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.980]   He says, come follow me.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.600]   And then he reveals himself to his disciples and then what they have seen and heard, they
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   go and proclaim.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.120]   So the chapter four is the beginning of John being shown the throne of God.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.800]   And that's where the revelation is going to one by one be revealed.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.660]   And then as he, after he sees the throne of God, he turns around and he sees the line
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.440]   of Judah in the form of the lamb of God, right?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.920]   And then that opens up the seal judgments.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   Okay.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.840]   In chapter six, right?
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.240]   Do you remember what the seal judgments were?
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.640]   I'm not going to go through all of them, but what was the beginning of the seal judgments?
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.080]   Right.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.960]   The four horsemen, right?
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   Four horsemen.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.200]   And then you have the martyrs and then you have the, right?
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.900]   And then you have the kings and the nations who are hiding because the judgment is coming.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.120]   And then the seventh seal gets opened up, right?
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   That's chapter six.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.240]   And then chapter seven, you have the, what is that a picture of?
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.240]   Huh?
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.040]   You're worshiping the lamb.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.640]   True?
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   What's the significant number here?
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   Okay.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.080]   144,000 tribe of Judah.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.920]   And then behind them, all the other nations who are worshiping the lamb, right?
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.120]   So chapter four is the worship of the father.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.440]   Chapter seven is the worship of the lamb.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.480]   And then the trumpet judgments open up, right?
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.840]   What is the key in the trumpet judgments?
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.440]   What is a significant number in the trumpet judgments?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.900]   Third.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.040]   So just remember, even if you don't remember the order, the third of the earth, the third
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.240]   of the sea, the third of the mountains, right?
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   The third.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.780]   So it's that third of the judgment.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.840]   So the beginning of it is judgment.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.400]   If you look at all the judgment is on creation, right?
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.780]   Not specifically on men, not yet.
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.380]   And then chapter nine is the judgment where it's intense judgment.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.340]   So you have the locust who comes in and they represent demonic power, if you remember,
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.720]   and it's very thorough.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.520]   So there's an increase in the intensity of judgment, right?
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.480]   It's all coming back to you, right?
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.080]   Remember chapter 10, right?
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.920]   This gigantic angel who has his one foot in the ocean, one foot on the mountains and representing
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.280]   the power of this angel and what is in his hands, right?
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   What's going to happen?
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.840]   He eats that and how does it taste in his mouth?
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.520]   It's sweet, but it's bitter in his stomach.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   And what does that represent?
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.520]   Sweetness of the coming of Christ, but bitterness of the judgment that he will bring, right?
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.980]   And then this is where we left off.
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.160]   Chapter 11, the vision begins with the measuring of the temple, right?
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.080]   And what did the measuring of the temple signify?
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.600]   Why do you measure anything?
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.200]   Huh?
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.880]   Say it.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.920]   My hearing is so bad, I can't.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.920]   To renovate, right?
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.360]   And you're measuring something because you're trying to renovate something.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.560]   So he sends them out, they're measuring and basically God is going to restore, right?
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.080]   Restore worship, restore possibly the nation of Israel.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.720]   And then you have the two witnesses that come, right?
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.680]   These two powerful witnesses and they're able to conquer everything except the beast, right?
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.180]   And this beast overpowers them and then after that they get resurrected and they go up.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.600]   And then so at the end of chapter 11, it ends with the seventh trumpet.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.260]   And the seventh trumpet opens up what we're getting into in verse 12, okay?
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.260]   Or chapter 12.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.400]   That's where we are.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.840]   So the general outline in chapter one to three, right?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.640]   Chapter one is the vision of Christ.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.960]   Chapter two and three is the seven churches.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.740]   Chapter four is he gives a vision of the throne of God, right?
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.500]   Chapter five is a lamb of God that opens up the seals.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.000]   Chapter six are the seals, right?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.060]   And then chapter seven is the opening of the trumpets.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.060]   Trumpet judgments.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.060]   Yes?
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.060]   Right?
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.380]   Then what was chapter eight?
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.380]   What did I forget?
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:15.280]   Oh, so sorry.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   That's what I forgot.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.860]   Chapter seven is the 144,000 and then the nations.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.260]   Chapter eight is the trumpet judgments.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.260]   And then chapter nine again is the beginning of the woes, remember?
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.260]   Remember?
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:32.300]   The first three, first four of the trumpet judgments is toward the earth and then he
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.100]   says the three woes are coming.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.460]   The fifth, sixth, and seventh are the three woes.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.500]   And the three woes are the meaning that the intensity of the judgment is coming and the
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.620]   judgment is directly directed toward people.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.620]   Remember that?
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.020]   And the chapter nine says that the judgment is going to be so severe that they're going
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.860]   to want to die but they can't die.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.520]   That's how torturous that period is going to be.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.380]   And so we left off right there where we dealt with the two woes, right?
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.580]   The third woe hasn't been opened up yet.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:06.980]   So as we jump into chapter 12, that's kind of where we are.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.620]   Chapter 12 through chapter 19 opens up a new section.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.980]   Even though the judgment is going to continue, there's a big gap until the bowl judgment.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.660]   So I made a mistake on your paper.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.820]   I said seal judgment but it's not the bowl judgment.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.000]   So as we're going through, if you see seal, that's a mistake.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.060]   Just cross that out.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.600]   I was referring to bowl judgment.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:36.840]   So chapter 12 through chapter 16, there's kind of a gap where it's almost a preparation
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.400]   for what is about to come.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.800]   The severest judgment is saved for the last part of the tribulation.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.160]   So you can imagine the intensity of the judgment up to this point but it says nothing is going
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.620]   to be compared to what is actually going to come.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.700]   So chapter 12 and on is going to prepare for that, right?
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.700]   What do we call this?
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.400]   Genesis 3.15.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.220]   We call it, in English, we call it the first gospel, right?
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.980]   Or we call it proto evangelium, meaning that, again, the interpretation of the first gospel.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:18.740]   So if you look at it, right after the fall, God makes a promise to the world that I will
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.800]   put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring and he shall
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.380]   bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.260]   What does this passage remind you of?
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.780]   If you read today's text, I'm sure you would have seen the correlation with this because
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.900]   this is what's being fulfilled today in chapter 12.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.900]   Yes?
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.420]   Okay, those of you nodding your head, you read it.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.060]   The other guys are like, "Oh, okay, that's interesting.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.060]   I better go read it."
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.060]   Okay.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.940]   So that's pretty clear, right?
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:55.420]   So redemptive plan of mankind begins with this prophecy and we're now here in Revelation
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.260]   chapter 12 at the end of human history, at least almost at the end of human history,
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260]   God is fulfilling this promise.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:08.140]   So now you have this battle between the woman and her seed and then Satan and his followers,
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.280]   right?
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.260]   And this cosmic battle is going to take place.
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:17.980]   And within this cosmic battle, Satan is obviously going to lose and as a result of that, he
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.460]   comes and he gets thrown down to earth and while he's on this earth, he's basically creating
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.780]   havoc for her seed, right?
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.300]   But at the end of it, her seed is going to crush the head of the serpent as he is introduced
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.980]   here and then we know how that's going to be fulfilled.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:40.100]   So you can kind of summarize that all of redemptive history is summarized with the fulfillment
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.740]   of this prophecy, right?
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.740]   So we're at the end of this in Revelation chapter 12.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:54.120]   We're at the end fulfillment of this promise of redemption, okay?
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:59.580]   So chapter 12 begins a new section in Revelation.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.300]   Chapter 11 ended with the seventh trumpet and we kind of reviewed that already being
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.120]   blown but the seven seal judgments don't begin until chapter 16.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:14.140]   So chapter 12, 13, 14, and 15, you're going to have events that are actually going to
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.860]   set up for the bowl judgments, okay?
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.480]   So all these events that are taking place is going to give the rationale behind why
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.160]   these judgments are happening in chapter 16.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.860]   So this section should not be read chronologically because it's not simply referring to just
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.180]   that short period.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:40.380]   So this is kind of like just like I said, Genesis chapter 3, 15 was promised and so
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:46.060]   chapter 12 is basically revealing to us what's happening up in heaven for this being fulfilled.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.500]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.200]   He's not simply talking about at the very end tip of his redemptive history where this
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.780]   is taking place.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:00.020]   So the vision that he sees in chapter 12, it encompasses all of the redemptive history.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.020]   Understand?
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:07.420]   Let me say that one more time because some of you guys are not even making eye contact.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:14.260]   What he says in chapter 12 is not to be understood as just that tip part, the end three and a
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.820]   half years that he talks about.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.380]   So it's not like he's at the very end so all the vision that he sees is what's happening
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.620]   in those three and a half years.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:29.060]   It's meant to be understood as, chapter 12 is meant to be understood as how this prophecy
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:35.940]   of the seed of the woman crushing the head of the serpent is being fulfilled, right?
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.820]   In redemptive history as a whole.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:43.380]   You don't get to ask somebody, okay?
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.860]   You understand what I'm saying, right?
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.180]   Because if you try to apply this to the three and a half years, it's not going to fit.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.900]   You guys are like no response whatsoever.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.900]   Yes?
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.900]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.900]   Okay.
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.860]   I'm going to move on.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:07.020]   So chapters 12 to 15 sets up to explain the severest of the sevenfold judgments that will
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:14.220]   unfold in the seven seal judgments, but it's bold judgments.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:21.340]   This is the reason behind the intense judgment at the end is because of what was happening
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.900]   up in heaven.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.500]   So there's a spiritual battle that is manifesting in the physical world.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.500]   Okay?
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.780]   I'm going to say that one more time.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:37.460]   There's a spiritual battle that's happening in the heavenly realm that is going to be
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.300]   manifested in the earthly realm.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.900]   So the vision that he's seeing is the vision of heaven, right?
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:53.180]   And so we see glimpse of it where that is going to be manifested on earth, but the vision
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:59.460]   that he's seeing is what's happening up in heaven.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:05.540]   So the conflict, which chapters 12 through 15 record, it comes as a result of unleashing
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.180]   of satanic fury.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.220]   Satan knows the days are numbered and he makes a last ditch attempt to inflict damage before
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.220]   his demise.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.660]   So the difference between the judgment that we've seen up to chapter one through 11, or
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:26.900]   specifically chapter four through 11, is God is bringing inflicting judgment upon mankind.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.380]   Right?
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.300]   The first three and a half years are in a tribulation or what's happening, but God is
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.700]   directly involved in this judgment.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.420]   And then remember we talked about that, that even in the context of his judgment, what
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:45.580]   is God doing?
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.100]   Is God just bringing judgment and then he's done?
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.620]   What is his end goal up to this point?
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.020]   You guys remember?
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.140]   Yes.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.140]   Thank you.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.140]   Whoever said that, thank you.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.140]   Okay.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.340]   So even in the context of him bringing all these severe judgment, remember prior to us
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.260]   getting to this text, he said one of the divisions that came in says that God is no longer going
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.060]   to delay.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.060]   Remember that?
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.060]   And what did he mean by that?
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:22.140]   That up to this point that he's been patient, that even in the midst of judgment, he's waiting
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.380]   for them to repent.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.220]   Even as he is inflicting all like a third of the earth being wiped out, his end goal
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.220]   is that some of them will still repent and come to Christ.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.220]   Right?
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.660]   So he's not even directly involved with that.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:39.100]   Now the second half of this, the end part of it that we're going to be talking about,
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:45.680]   he says he's bringing judgment, but the judgment is he's releasing it to Satan.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.780]   So Satan's hand is going to be directly involved in the last part of the judgment that's coming.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.780]   Right?
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.580]   And so that's why the second half of the tribulation is going to be much more intense.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.620]   Right?
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:03.940]   Where it's kind of like you may feel the pain, but the pain is coming from a physician whose
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.100]   ultimate intent is to bring about repentance.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.140]   Right?
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:14.100]   The second half of it is where in the context of this battle, Satan, at least what is revealed
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.700]   to us, is Satan sees that his days are numbered.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.420]   So during the last period, everything that he saved up, right?
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.780]   If you're kind of like in a basketball game and you have only five minutes left, and this
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.780]   is the last championship game, and after this game it's over, you're going to spend every
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.660]   single second of the time that you have and exert.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.580]   So you don't have to save any energy.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.580]   Right?
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:45.820]   So basically what we're seeing is Satan's very last part of before he gets bound and
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.360]   judged where he unleashes his fury upon mankind.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.740]   And his intent is not to bring us to repentance.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.860]   His intent is strictly to harm.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:17:00.980]   And he's going to target, who is he targeting?
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.380]   The seed of the woman, right?
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.400]   He's targeting Christians.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.980]   So that's the distinction that we see in the first half and the second half.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:14.420]   The first half, half the judgment is coming upon mankind, and those who are sealed by
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.620]   the lamb, right?
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.800]   He protects.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   The second half, Satan is unleashed, and he comes and he specifically targets Christians,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.120]   right?
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.540]   The seed of the woman.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.040]   So the second half is going to be much more intense for Christians.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.520]   We're going to go through the judgment.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.460]   We're going to see all the natural disasters and experience all of that.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.080]   But second half is targeted toward Christians.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.960]   At least that's what is revealed here.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   Okay?
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.480]   So you understand the distinction?
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.060]   Up to chapter 11 and some from chapter 12.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:54.320]   Chapter 12 is specifically about the suffering and persecution of Christians.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.600]   Chapter 7 contains two of the seven signs that are mentioned beginning chapter 7 and
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   ending in chapter 19.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.200]   So I'm not going to go through all of it, but typically when the Bible talks about signs,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.080]   what does it represent?
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   Sign of what?
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.020]   Why do they even use the term sign?
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.700]   Sign points to something.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.380]   Yes?
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.140]   Jesus performed all of his miracles as a sign of who he is, right?
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.060]   The miracles that Jesus performed were sign gifts, right?
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.380]   To signify that these were apostles.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.980]   So when the Bible talks about sign, it is for the purpose of proving and to point to
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.980]   something.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:45.020]   So in the last part, starting from chapter 12 to chapter 19, the term, the great sign,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.220]   right, is used seven different times.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.820]   Two of them is mentioned here in chapter 12.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.740]   And then the other five are scattered starting from chapter 13 to 19.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:02.380]   Meaning that all that was prophesied, everything that God has been saying and preparing is
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.860]   going to start to be fulfilled as a sign.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.860]   You understand what?
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.860]   The great sign.
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.700]   So these aren't just random events.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.060]   Not that anything prior to this were random, but these are very significant things that
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.980]   God has been preparing and he's allowing it to happen.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.580]   That's why, again, over and over again, it reminds us that this is the great sign, the
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.820]   great sign, right?
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.820]   Another great sign is happening.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.780]   This is another great sign.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.260]   That when Jesus said, "The end is not going to come until the man of lawlessness is revealed,"
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:38.260]   and then, you know, before the end, because of the increase of wickedness, the love of
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.460]   God, the love of Christ is going to grow cold.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.100]   So all of these signs, all of these things that Jesus and the prophets had said are going
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.540]   to be fulfilled at the end time, he's saying those signs are being revealed here.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.860]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:59.380]   So we're at the very end, basically.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:09.140]   The first sign that opens up in chapter 12 is the sign of the woman and her male child.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.660]   How many of you read that and thought, like, "Oh, that must be Mary," right?
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.260]   It sounds like Mary, but if you look closely at the context and if you read carefully,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.260]   there are certain things that are stated here that's most likely not Mary.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.580]   In fact, most commentaries believe that this is not referring to Mary, but the nation of
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.380]   Israel, okay?
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.420]   The reason behind that, a few of the reasons, the Old Testament often referred to Israel
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.540]   as a woman, and those are all passages.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.540]   I think I have some verses to back it up.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.580]   In Micah 4.10, "Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.640]   shall go out from the city and dwell in the open country.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.640]   You shall be to Babylon.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.700]   There you shall be rescued.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.180]   There the Lord will redeem you from the hand of your enemy."
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:59.940]   So again, there's many verses where Israel is referred to as a pregnant woman.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:05.100]   Isaiah 26.17, "Like a pregnant woman who rise and cries out in her pangs when she is near
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.100]   to giving birth, so were we because of you, O Lord."
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.460]   So again, I'll just give you a few verses, okay?
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.900]   So one of the reasons why the commentators believe that this is probably in reference
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:22.380]   to the nation of Israel is because it is commonly, Israel is commonly referred to as a woman in
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.980]   the Old Testament, okay?
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:30.940]   In Genesis 37.9-11, in Joseph's dreams, he sees the sun and the moon, and it's a description
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.680]   of his brothers bound down to him, right?
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:41.580]   So if you look at chapter 12, the woman is described as having the sun and the moon,
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.260]   the glory of the sun and the moon on her.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.500]   So let me go to that passage.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.500]   So it's Genesis 37.9-11.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.460]   It says, "Joseph dreamed another dream and told it to his brother and said, 'Behold,
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.700]   I have dreamed another dream.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.980]   Behold, the sun, the moon, and the 11 stars were bound down to me.'"
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:04.820]   So clearly in this text, when Joseph dreams this dream, who are the sun and the moon?
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.820]   They're his brothers.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.380]   And who are his brothers?
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.260]   Tribes of Israel, right?
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.420]   So the description of sun and the moon, again, here is talking about the origins of Israel.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.460]   So the woman is described as having the sun and the moon, the glory of the sun and the
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.460]   moon.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:30.020]   And then thirdly, the 12 stars are clear reference to the 12 tribes of Israel, right?
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:37.220]   So if you look at the context, a larger context, it's probably in reference to, not to Mary,
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.540]   but to the nation of Israel.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:43.460]   And so giving birth, meaning that Christ was coming through the line that God had prepared
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:51.180]   through the nation of Israel, that he is the fulfilled prophecy, again, of the seed of
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.180]   the woman.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.740]   So Genesis 3.15, when it says, "The seed of the woman is going to come," and that seed
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.060]   was coming through the line of Israel, through Judah.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:07.460]   And so the woman is Israel, okay?
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:15.300]   Clearly, there's no debate of who the child is, the male child.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.380]   He is clearly Jesus Christ.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.420]   There are three specific things that are mentioned.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.220]   He rules all the nations with a rod of iron.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.300]   He is caught up to God and to his own throne.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.260]   So only Jesus would fit that role.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:35.900]   Then finally, he's clearly called Christ, the lamb who conquers by his blood, right?
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:43.620]   And this is the reason why Satan was actively trying to destroy the woman and her seed,
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.980]   because she knows that the fulfilled prophet, when he comes, that he's going to crush the
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:52.460]   head of the serpent, and that's exactly what he does, by conquering, right?
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:58.840]   Through his blood.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:09.440]   The second sign that is mentioned is of the great red dragon and his angels.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:15.840]   The dragon is clearly identified as the devil or Satan in verse 9.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.400]   And there's going to be this cosmic conflict between Satan and his angels and the archangel
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.440]   Michael and his angels.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.880]   And we'll get to that in a minute, right?
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.600]   But just want to take a few minutes to...
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.480]   I can go here and list dozens and dozens of different ways that Satan is described in
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:41.360]   the scripture, that this is our primary adversary, where the Bible says that we have an enemy
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.040]   who is like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.440]   His whole intent is to block us from coming to Christ, right?
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.740]   And he uses all kinds of scheming.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.800]   And so his primary work that he does is scheming to deceive, right?
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   Sending false prophets, lulling us to sleep, causing us to be lukewarm.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:09.360]   And so his work is not, again, at least in our lives, necessarily a power encounter,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.680]   but of scheming, right?
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:22.100]   Satan, the term, is used 52 times in scripture, and it literally simply means adversary.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:28.600]   His primary work is to oppose the work of God.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   So if you're not walking right with God, he's not your adversary, right?
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   Because his primary work is to prevent us from coming to God.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   So his primary adversary is to God and to his people, right?
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:50.340]   And to keep the world to himself.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.920]   So he's not opposed to the world.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.680]   The world is already his.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.240]   He's opposed to the church.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   He's opposed to Christ.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   He's opposed to his people.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.600]   The second term that is used most often is the term devil.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.760]   It only appears in the New Testament, not in the Old Testament, but the word simply
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:15.640]   means to slander, to accuse, right?
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.000]   So he constantly stands to condemn, right?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:27.620]   So his primary advocacy against us is to accuse and to condemn and to slander.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.400]   Before the fall, he's called the day star.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:37.500]   In Isaiah 14, 12, he's called the bearer of light, which translated in Latin is where
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.980]   we get the word Lucifer, right?
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:48.040]   So Lucifer, the literal meaning of the term Lucifer is not dark, right?
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.000]   That was a name that was given to him before he fell, that he's the morning star or bearer
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.520]   of light, right?
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.980]   And the scripture also talks about how when the end time comes, the deception is going
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.420]   to come as what?
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.640]   As an angel of light, right?
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:14.160]   So Satan is very, like he knows how to deceive, basically.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.760]   That's his primary objective, right?
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.000]   Because he himself was an angel of light.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.040]   So he knows how to dress up as an angel of light and to deceive.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:32.000]   But Elzebub, it's another word that is again used to describe him, lord of flies or lord
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.180]   of dung, right?
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.680]   Even though he is lord, but he's lord of nothing.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   He's lord of a world that's going to be condemned.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:47.400]   So all those who follow him are following a god of dung, right?
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:53.240]   John 8, 44, he's called the father of lies, right?
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:28:03.320]   He's called the ruler and god of this age.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.260]   Angel of light, 2 Corinthians 11, 14.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:14.440]   He's called the old serpent, dragon is how he's described today.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:21.480]   You know what's interesting was one of the commentators pointed out that Satan before
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.880]   the fall looked like a dragon.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.860]   And then remember what happens to him when he's kicked out of heaven?
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.800]   God judges, what was the judgment against Satan?
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:38.520]   That he's going to be a snake, he's going to crawl on the ground.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.160]   So one of the commentators mentioned that it's interesting that the dragon without his
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.960]   wings and feet is basically a snake, right?
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.480]   Anyway, whether you accept that or not, I thought that was interesting.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:59.760]   He's saying like a dragon that was judged is a snake, right?
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.960]   And his primary work is to deceive the world.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:15.140]   And then he works again in verse 10, the accuser of God's people, right?
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:20.560]   So all of these things are, I think it's important for us to know who the identity of our adversary
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.600]   is because if you don't know what he's doing, right?
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.920]   I think the mistake that we can make is when we think about Satan, like I know some of
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:35.400]   you guys like watching scary movies and I'm going to say something that some of you guys
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.400]   may not like.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.600]   I don't think you guys should be watching scary movies, right?
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.120]   And let me tell you why.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:48.120]   Because your worldview of the satanic world is being created by something outside of the
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.760]   Bible.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:55.480]   And so this is, even though Satan, we don't worship Satan and Satan is not our God, Satan
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.620]   is our primary adversary.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:04.680]   So if you have a wrong view of Satan, it could be just as detrimental to your walk with God
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.140]   because you don't know who you're fighting.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.960]   And it can have an adverse effect in both ways.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.520]   Either you trivialize the occult, right?
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.640]   Because you become so desensitized to the occult that you think it's nothing.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.860]   It's like a joke.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.480]   The scripture says he's like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:29.760]   So our enemy is actively working to accuse and to destroy us and Hollywood trivializes
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.760]   that.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.960]   Or the other extreme is where it becomes so freaked out, right?
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:40.080]   About the occult where even though in your mind you know that God is almighty and powerful,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.920]   but because of what you're watching and seeing on the screen, satanic power is all powerful
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.120]   and mighty, right?
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.680]   Right away your worldview is being created, informed by what you're watching and media
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.880]   is very powerful, right?
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.960]   You don't have certain things that are controlled by God and then certain things controlled
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.440]   by Satan and then you got a whole bunch of things in the middle that nobody controls.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.480]   Is that how the Bible describes the world?
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.160]   So there are some things that God controls, some things that Satan controls, and there's
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.440]   a bunch of stuff in the middle that it's kind of neutral.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.000]   Is that how the Bible describes the world?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.120]   No.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.760]   The Bible describes it as either God is sovereign or Satan is sovereign.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.840]   It's one or the other.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.680]   So we have to ask ourselves, is the media controlled by God or Satan?
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:37.320]   All right, I'm going to go off a little bit, okay, on this because I'm kind of, you know,
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:44.280]   I kind of see the culture of just watching these scary movies and you may not agree with
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.320]   me but it is creating your view of the occult.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.720]   And I think, at least for us, you know, I came from a charismatic background where there
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.240]   was too much attention to that and I couldn't wake up in the middle of the night because
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.640]   I was so afraid of demonic forces because they put too much emphasis on it, right?
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:08.240]   You and I belong to a culture where we talk about it but it's not real, right?
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.640]   The scripture constantly reminds us it's real.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   Satanic power is real, right?
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.960]   Unless you're studying this as some literary study and if you're actually studying it like
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:23.720]   we are studying it as real events, as real people, right, real forces that are actively
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   working to accuse us, to thwart us away from God, then what you allow into your mind, right,
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.200]   it does affect you.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:41.760]   And I could, you know, and I say this and I'm very cautious to overstep my bound because
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:48.120]   I don't want to start creating rules in the church that are not stated in the scripture
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:53.560]   but I will go as far as to say that if it doesn't bother you, it may be because you
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:33:01.280]   have become desensitized to it, not because your spirit inside is telling you it's okay,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.280]   right?
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.640]   So I want to strongly encourage you to be discerning of what you watch and I'm not just
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.960]   talking about the occult, I'm talking about everything else too but especially because
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.120]   we're on this topic of watching the occult.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.360]   So some of you guys, you know, like to be scared, go ride a roller coaster, you know
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.760]   what I mean, or have somebody jump out in the middle of the night and scare you.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.820]   But if you're in a habit of watching scary movies, like it is affecting you, right?
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.320]   And so Satan is real, right?
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.960]   Satan is real.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:40.760]   This is what we're reading, he may not actually look like a dragon, we may not know exactly
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:46.720]   what he looks like but there is an evil force that is actively working against us, detrimental
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.520]   to us spiritually, we become desensitized to the spiritual battle that you and I are
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:55.600]   in, okay?
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.880]   If you disagree, come and talk to me, okay?
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.880]   You probably won't but I invite you anyway, okay?
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.520]   So Satan is described to have seven heads and seven diadems that represent power and
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:15.480]   authority.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:23.680]   The ten horns, they're also repeated in Daniel 7, 7 and verse 24 of Daniel, 7, 24, which
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.240]   I think is really interesting if you read the text and I'll come back to that.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:35.520]   So Daniel 7, 7 is a description of the beast but it says, "After I saw in the night vision
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.680]   and behold the fourth beast terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong, it had great
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.920]   iron teeth, it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.240]   It was different from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns."
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.640]   So ten horns is introduced to us as the beast and then the passage I want you to look at
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.640]   is in verse 24 and 25.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.840]   "As for the ten horns out of the kingdom, ten kings shall arise."
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:06.000]   So many believe that the ten horns is representative of ten kingdoms, ten nations that's going
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.480]   to rise and become one.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.400]   And out of that, later on, it's not mentioned here, out of that, the three are going to
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.120]   gather together and overthrow and Satan is going to come or the Antichrist is going to
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.920]   come and begin to rule.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.000]   Now is that going to actually happen or not?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I don't know.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I've heard it so many times.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.800]   You know, when I was younger, there's a ten nation federation.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.480]   So I remember when the European Union got together and they brought the currency, there
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.720]   was a lot of talk about it.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   There it is.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.320]   That's a ten nation federation, right?
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.760]   And somehow they counted ten, right?
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.760]   I don't know if that's the thing.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.020]   I don't think that's what it is.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:46.520]   And I'm not exactly sure what these ten horns represent but again, many people think that
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:52.280]   it's in reference to a world union of some kind, right?
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:56.840]   Again, from this point on, it's just complete conjecture.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:02.040]   I think, and I could be wrong, okay, I think at the end times what's going to happen is
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.440]   there is going to be world unity and it's going to be led by the Antichrist.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.440]   The unity is not going to be led by a Christian figure.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.200]   It's somebody who's going to come representing a religious figure.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.560]   And if you look at the world events right now, because of the terrorist activity, like
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:27.440]   anything that's extreme is kind of lumped in with the terrorist, even with Christians,
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   right?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.840]   Oh, you're one of those fundamentalists.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.040]   So if you disagree with them, you're a homophobe, you're a racist, you're whatever it is, we're
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.600]   kind of put into this extreme.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.780]   So there's this growing movement of everybody coming together.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.720]   So if you've been watching the news, there's more and more of these liberal Christians,
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.120]   liberal Buddhists, liberal Muslims, nominal of every religion is coming together and they're
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.040]   holding hands, they're having joint services.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.440]   Have you noticed that?
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:01.080]   There's more and more of the nominal on every religion is coming together in the middle.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.160]   And the group that is leading that right now are the liberal Catholics.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.720]   And again, I don't know if it's going to be the Pope or a Christian figure, but my guess
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:15.120]   is because he's going to come as an angel of light, it's going to be a liberal Christian
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:21.960]   figure who comes representing Christ, but has rejected inerrancy, rejected the gospel,
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.720]   and they're going to hold hands with all these other religions.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.280]   And at the end of it, the Antichrist is going to rise from that.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.720]   And when he takes control over that, it's not just going to have religious power, it's
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.240]   also going to have political power.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.500]   Okay.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.880]   This job is just me.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   Okay.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:46.920]   I'm just taking bits and pieces of what I've read in Daniel, what I've been taught, that
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.000]   if it doesn't happen, don't stone me.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.560]   I'm just telling you, but it just seems like looking at the world events, that if Antichrist
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.640]   is going to come and he's going to be a world figure and he's going to come as an angel
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.040]   of light, he needs to be a religious figure.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.440]   But what religious figure is going to unite the world?
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.960]   It has to be liberal.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.920]   It has to hold hands with all the other religions.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.880]   And right now, religion and politics are being mixed.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.400]   Even though they're saying they're trying to kick out of it, they're trying to kick
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:21.360]   out the extreme religions on every religion.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:26.320]   But again, if you look at this, "He asked for the 10 horns out of the kingdom, 10 kings
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.900]   shall arise and another shall arise after them.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.960]   He shall be different from the former ones and shall put down three kings."
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:38.560]   Again, that's the out of the 10, three kings, he's going to conquer the three and then out
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.400]   of the power of the three, he's going to take over the 10.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.600]   "He shall speak words from the Most High against the Most High."
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.600]   In other words, he's going to be directly going against God himself.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.080]   "And shall wear out the saints of the Most High, his children."
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.480]   He's going to persecute God's children.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.720]   "And shall think to change the times and the law."
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:05.000]   So God's law upon his people, he's going to forcefully change.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.560]   You could see that happening already, right?
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.200]   "And they shall be given into his hand for a time, times and a half a time."
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.560]   So three and a half years.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.660]   So during those three and a half years, Satan is going to directly blaspheme against God
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.600]   and go after his people, and he's going to change the law that God had given.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:30.080]   So he's going to be in power for a short period of time until God comes and he says it's the
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   end, right?
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.300]   God's going to allow him.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:38.080]   So Satan right now is being restrained by the power of God because the church is still
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.740]   here, the gospel is being spread.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:45.060]   But at the very end, he's going to unleash Satan and he's going to allow Satan to have
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.280]   its full effect.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.960]   So he's going to reign publicly.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.560]   Right now he's scheming behind the scene, but the last part of human history, he's going
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.760]   to be released to do whatever he wants.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.160]   He's going to go against God and go specifically against his people.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.160]   And again, this is where the debate is the church going to be here during this period?
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.000]   Are we going to be saved from that?
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.520]   That's the view of pre-trib or post-trib.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:14.120]   If you believe in a pre-trib, that these Christians who are going to be persecuted are the ones
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.600]   who weren't raptured in pre-trib.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.800]   So these are Christians who got converted because they saw the judgment of God in the
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.360]   first three and a half years, and so they repented and came to Christ.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.160]   And then as a result of that, the second half of the seven years, there's going to be intense
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.260]   judgment and persecution for them.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.720]   If you believe in the pre-trib.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.880]   I told you I lean more toward post-trib, right?
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.880]   I'm not like gung-ho about it, but I lean more toward the post-trib that these Christians
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.000]   are talking about us.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.480]   That God is going to preserve us, that we're not going to lose our salvation, but we're
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.400]   going to go through the suffering.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:54.920]   And that this is not a second group of people who converse during the tribulation, but the
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.280]   church itself at that period.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.840]   And again, I'm not going to go into my argument behind that.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   Why?
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.760]   Because there's Christians around the world who are already going through this right now,
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.640]   being beheaded for their faith.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.800]   So to me, it doesn't make sense that this preservation is only for rich people in nice
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:23.760]   countries where all the other people are already going through this.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.160]   The last scene, Michael, the archangel and his angels wage war against Satan and his
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.160]   angels win.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:37.200]   And as a result, Satan and his angels are cast out of heaven.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.400]   In verse four, it states that when the dragon was cast out of heaven, his tail swept the
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.260]   third of the stars from heaven.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.700]   Many believe that this is in reference to the third of the angels that followed Satan's
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   rebellion.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.700]   And this is where we get Satan and his angels.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:58.360]   And again, clearly there's a battle between Archangel Michael and the angels and dragon
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.100]   and his angels.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.100]   So who are these angels?
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.540]   I believe that that's in reference to verse four, the third of the angels.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.740]   So that's how powerful Satan was.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:11.340]   He was able to lead a rebellion against God, a third.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.380]   Two third of the angels are still with God.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:18.180]   But if you notice, the conflict is not between Satan and God.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.180]   It's between Satan and Archangel Michael.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:33.260]   So even in the midst of all of this, God is still sovereign.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:40.180]   The dragon, knowing his time is short, begins his attack on the woman, the child and her
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.660]   children, who keep the commandments.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:50.180]   So again, it's not everybody who goes to church, but the attack are for those who are
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.540]   genuine followers of Christ.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:59.260]   The woman flees into the wilderness, which was prepared by God, and she is nourished
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:07.020]   for 1,260 days, which calculated is three and a half years, the second half of the seven
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:10.020]   year tribulation.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:18.300]   Ultimately, Satan's power is conquered by Christ through the blood of the Lamb, in verse
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.860]   10 through 12.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:25.940]   Again, that's why we said we can't apply this specifically just to that period, because
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:33.580]   this division in chapter 12 reveals to us from the very beginning until the very end.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.900]   But it's set up for the judgments that's coming in chapter 16.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:44.940]   And then verse 17, and let me just read this, "Then the dragon became furious with the woman
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:51.540]   and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring," talking about Christians, "on
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:56.100]   those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus, and he stood
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.260]   on the sand of the sea."
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:08.060]   So chapter 12 ends with the dragon or Satan angry, and he's furiously going after the
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:17.540]   woman's children, which sets us up for verse 13, chapter 13 and 14 and 15, where we're
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.480]   leaving this week with Satan angry.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.820]   So you can imagine, so now the work of Satan has just begun, and he's going to begin to
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.500]   unleash his servants, the beasts, right?
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:38.660]   The beasts who are his servants, and you could see, what I want you to see is Satan is trying
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:43.620]   to usurp God's glory, or he wants some of God's glory.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:52.460]   And what you'll notice in Satan's work, that Satan, I don't think that's in one of my questions,
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:45:01.420]   but I want you to see Satanic work and see if you can see traces of the work of God.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:06.540]   What I mean by that is Satan is trying to mimic God.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.640]   He mimics the Trinity.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.700]   He mimics the way he does his work by sending his angel.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.980]   God sends his angels, Satan sends his angels, right?
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:19.300]   So a lot of the things that Satan does is the opposite of what God's doing, but for
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.300]   evil.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:26.180]   So I want you to pay attention to that as we're studying, starting from chapter 13.
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:31.020]   So we end here with verse 17, and I want to just quickly go over the discussion questions
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.260]   for you so that you can take some time in discussion.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:45.100]   And as I mentioned to you before, be cautious in the way that you approach the occult.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:52.180]   And I know this is very, you're not going to like this either, but, and I'm not saying
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:59.420]   that you can't or you shouldn't, but even innocent things like children's books, like
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.460]   Harry Potter, right?
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.940]   Don't get nervous, right?
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.880]   I'm not saying, "You can't read Harry Potter," right?
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:14.720]   But I'm just saying that even innocent things like Harry Potter, like we need to be mindful
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:19.100]   of what it is saying and what is developing in our mind, like how we see the occult.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:24.100]   When we talk about God detests, right?
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:31.240]   He detests anything that has to do with magic and fortune telling, because all of these
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.300]   things are symbols of rebellion against God.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.180]   True or not?
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.380]   It is.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:43.080]   The scripture detests it, and anybody practice sorcery in the Old Testament was stoned immediately
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:49.020]   because it was directly connected to the occult, and the occult was demonic.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:53.360]   There's only two kinds of spirit, either from God or either from Satan, right?
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.700]   So I'm not saying, so therefore, these books and movies and all of these things that you
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:03.420]   can't watch and you need to discern for yourself, but you need to be discerning.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.760]   Yes?
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:11.180]   Everything that you do, not Scary Farm, be discerning.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.620]   Don't just do it because everybody else does it.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.900]   Be discerning.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:19.020]   If you're going to do it, think through it.
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.020]   Think through it.
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.020]   Don't just say, "Where do you draw the line?"
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.580]   So I'm not going to draw the line at all.
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:28.420]   You're going to get into all kinds of trouble if that's your bottom line, right?
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:32.100]   And I don't want anybody to sit in here, judge people saying, "Oh, he's doing this," or,
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.100]   "He's watching that."
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.980]   I don't want to create that kind of environment either.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:41.260]   All I'm asking is, if the Satanic world is real, which we know that it is, then all the
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:47.380]   manifestation of Satan's work needs to be taken seriously, even if it is in the form
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.800]   of entertainment, right?
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.500]   So that it doesn't create a false view of the spiritual battle that you and I are engaged
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:00.660]   in because once you become desensitized to that, you are unaware that you are being attacked,
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.660]   right?
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.540]   Certain phrases that you use, certain things that you said, the using of the Ouija board,
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.540]   right?
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.940]   And you say, "Well, Harry Potter does it and whatever else does it."
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.940]   Like, okay.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.020]   I mean, I'm not saying that...
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.780]   I'm just targeting Harry Potter, so don't...
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.100]   It's not just Harry Potter.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.180]   It's all over the media.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.760]   But you can see how it gets desensitized, right?
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:23.020]   Where you're using the media and everybody is using it and it's like, "Oh, yeah, we're
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.620]   going to play around the Ouija board."
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:29.740]   But the whole point of the Ouija board is to call out the dead to speak.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.460]   And then Christians kind of engage in it because we become so desensitized, it just doesn't
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.460]   seem real.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.180]   So all I'm asking you to do is to be mindful.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:44.180]   Be mindful even of things that you are being entertained by that you don't just do it,
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.660]   that you have a clear reason why you're doing it, okay?
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.660]   Nobody's nodding.
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.660]   Okay.
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.660]   I said my piece.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:52.660]   All right.
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:58.540]   The three things that I want you guys to discuss, Paul reminds us.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.860]   Ephesians 6, 12, "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.980]   the authorities, against the cosmic powers over the present darkness, against the spiritual
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.660]   forces of evil in the heavenly places."
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.780]   How real is a spiritual battle in your life?
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.940]   Do you think you are aware of satanic activity, not only in the general world, but in your
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.980]   personal life?
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.240]   How is he attacking you?
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.020]   If so, what are they and how do you think he has been attacking?
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.300]   Are you aware there's satanic activity in your life?
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:28.500]   I guarantee you there is, right?
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:32.700]   When's the last time you thought about satanic activity specifically, not the world, not
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:37.140]   Kim Jong-un, you know, and these crazy movies, but you, right?
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.380]   Because you're a child of God.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.060]   He's not attacking the world generally.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.120]   He's not dropping nuclear bombs, right?
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.860]   He's scheming specifically.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.460]   So how is that happening in your life?
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.660]   When's the last time you really thought about that?
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:54.260]   Number two, how can you discern if something happening in your life is demonic activity
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.540]   versus just everyday struggles that all Christians go through?
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.260]   Do you think God has given us the ability to discern?
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.260]   If so, how?
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.020]   Let me answer that question, okay?
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.740]   God has given us the discernment to be able to.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.140]   He says test the spirits, right?
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.380]   So God wants us to test the spirits and discern whether that is from God or not.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:17.220]   But the scripture also says all things, the word of God is something that you need to
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.220]   grow, right?
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.220]   He said, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of the
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:26.240]   mind so that you may be able to test and approve that which is good and perfect will of God."
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:30.860]   So even God's will in the spiritual world is discerned spiritually.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:36.580]   So if you're insensitive spiritually, you're not going to be able to discern satanic or
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.900]   things from God, right?
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.620]   So if you're walking in the flesh, it's not something that you can just, there's a test
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:47.140]   of four things that you can test because it's spiritually discerned.
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:50.300]   So if you're spiritually insensitive, you're not going to know.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.600]   If you're spiritually sensitive, God has given us the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.880]   And God actually tells us to discern the spirit, right?
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.260]   So take some time to discuss that.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.260]   How do you discern?
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.260]   How do you know?
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:07.020]   Is it just emotions or are there some indicators?
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:12.820]   Number three, it is easier to imagine large-scale persecution that may come at us as a result
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:16.580]   of satanic activity, but how do you think you are handling the scheming and deceiving
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.780]   of the devil to draw us away from the passionate worship of God?
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:23.780]   In what way have you noticed yourself being deceived in the past?
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:29.420]   So again, this is kind of related to number one, but not to think of this spiritual battle
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.580]   as in just a larger scale, right?
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:37.420]   Of Michael and Satan going at it and, you know, archangels and so we're just kind of,
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.660]   you know, dust.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.540]   So this doesn't matter, right?
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.300]   We do matter because each one of us matters.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:49.180]   If God is counting the hair on our head and he cares about us to that extent, I guarantee
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.560]   you Satan is countering that, right?
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:58.540]   Just as much he cares for us, for the details of our life, I guarantee you Satan is concerned
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:03.740]   to thwart that on the other side as an adversary.
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.900]   So all these little things that we think don't matter do matter.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.220]   There's a spiritual battle going on.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:13.300]   That's why Paul warns us in Ephesians 6 to stay sober, that you're in a spiritual battle.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.860]   Even though it's manifested physically, there's something spiritually happening behind the
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.860]   scenes.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:22.060]   So again, the question is, are you aware of this, right?
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:28.420]   What kind of satanic activity do you think is happening?
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:33.920]   And I guarantee you there's something happening always, whether you're aware of it or not.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:38.700]   So take some time to discuss that, like what may or may not be, okay?
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:46.740]   Let me pray first and then I'll release you to your group.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:59.060]   Heavenly Father, as you've commanded us to walk by faith and not by sight, I pray, Father
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:06.700]   God, that our faith would be tangible, it would be real, that it would change our perspective.
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:11.940]   And we are bombarded, Lord, with media that constantly governs our thoughts, that causes
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:15.540]   us to be blinded, Lord God, of spiritual truths.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:20.500]   We are daily wrestling with the insensitivity, Lord God, of the things that are actually
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.220]   happening behind the scenes.
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:29.740]   We know when we are sober that all of these things, Lord God, are from you as a warning.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:35.060]   I pray, Father God, that your word would have its effect on us, that wherever we are in
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:38.860]   your walk with God, in our walk with you, I pray that this evening that you would help
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:39.860]   us in our discussion.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:47.100]   At least be aware, Father God, of what's happening, that we would not allow the devil to scheme
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.580]   or give him a foothold in our life, but we would engage in the spiritual battle, Father
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:52.580]   God.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:54:01.140]   And so we pray that as a church that you would cause us to be awake, sober, sensitive, and
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.460]   as a result of that, that we would see how helpless we are, Lord, without you.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.380]   So we pray for your grace over that.
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.380]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.380]   Amen.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:19.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
