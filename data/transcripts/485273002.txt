[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   Good morning again, everybody.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.280]   Would you please take your Bibles and turn over to Psalm chapter 77.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:19.320]   We're going to be reading from verse 1 through 15, and that's just an introductory verse
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.040]   I wanted to use to guide our thought into the passage that we have ultimately in Matthew.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.380]   So I'm going to be preaching from out of Matthew, but as an introduction, just turn over to
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.640]   Psalm 77.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.260]   And as you turn there, I want us to think about this idea.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.360]   You and I live in an absolutely fallen world, right?
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.180]   And right now, I mean, maybe there are people, politicians all around, whether on either
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.520]   side of the aisle, will promise you greater peace, greater prosperity, and a yes we can
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.160]   mentality that we're going to be really, really good.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.320]   But I read about the end in the Bible, and that's not really the case.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.320]   So I feel a suspicion you're trying to pull a fast one on me, right?
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.000]   Scripture says not only are we living in a fallen world, it's going to get worse, actually.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.840]   And what Jesus said was you are essentially going to suffer in this age.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.760]   Something is going to be constant, which is going to be the suffering of the people.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.200]   Not only that, I myself am a sinner.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.600]   And given that fact, I hurt myself in different ways, right?
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.140]   I inflict upon all kinds of different woes and pains upon myself because of the fact
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.740]   that I'm a sinner.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.640]   And then, I'm surrounded by sinners.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.100]   I'm not pointing at you, I'm just saying we live in, when we say a fallen generation,
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.040]   everybody can have the potential to disappoint us.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.840]   As a matter of fact, to hurt us very deeply.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.440]   And so, we're going to have sentiments of disappointment and great pain.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.040]   And the reaction to suffering that is expressed here in Psalm 77, so follow with me as I read.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.160]   It says, "My voice rises to God and I will cry out.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.400]   My voice rises to God, he'll hear me.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.160]   In the day of my trouble, I sought the Lord.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.480]   In the night, my hand stretched out with weariness.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.280]   My soul refused to be comforted.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.880]   When I remember God, then I am disturbed.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.080]   When I sigh, then my spirit grows faint."
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.580]   Salah.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.080]   "You have held my eyelids open.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.980]   I am so troubled I cannot speak.
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.580]   I have considered the days of old, the years of long ago.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.180]   I remember my song in the night.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.080]   I will meditate with my heart and my spirit ponders.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.180]   Will the Lord reject forever?
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.080]   Will he never be favorable again?
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.880]   Has his loving kindness ceased forever?
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.580]   Has his promise come to an end forever?
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.280]   Has God forgotten to be gracious?
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.080]   Or has he in anger withdrawn his compassion?"
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   Salah.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080]   That means to stop and think.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.280]   Those are some really expressive words of the sentiment that within the midst of suffering,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.080]   your feeling is, "God probably either forgot about me or he withdrew his grace."
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.880]   That's a sentiment.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.280]   And then it changes to verse 10.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.080]   "Then I said, 'It is actually my grief that the right hand of the Most High has changed.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.180]   I shall remember the deeds of the Lord.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.080]   Surely I will remember your wonders of old.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.780]   I will meditate on all your work and muse on your deeds.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.380]   Your way, O God, is holy.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.380]   What God is great like our God?
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.780]   You are the God who works wonders.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.480]   You have made known your strength among the peoples.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.880]   You have by your power redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.'"
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.680]   Salah.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   The fact of the matter is, A, you're going to experience incredible amounts of suffering.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.980]   And even those of you who have experienced incredible amount of blessing in your life,
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.680]   where perhaps you've never had to deal with physical ailment, sickness in the family,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.080]   or even things like being poor and not having enough.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.580]   Even then, many people will testify to the fact that the blessing of the Lord becomes painful to you.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.480]   Let me say that again.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.880]   The blessings of the earth, not the Lord.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.380]   Earthly blessings.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.380]   Having lots of money.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.680]   Burdensome.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   Right?
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.380]   Having lots of popularity.
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.280]   Burdensome.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.980]   Things in the world, it just tends to disappoint.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.980]   It tends to hurt in some odd way.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.680]   So that's one side.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.480]   But here and now, the passage is saying, the author is saying,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.880]   "But I am going to make sure that I don't lean on my experience."
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.380]   Oh, look at my extensive experience.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.380]   I am hopeless.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.480]   Those people are hopeless.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.380]   Everything is going to be as it is.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.680]   Everything is for naught.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.780]   No. He says, "What I'm going to do in this midst of the suffering is going to look
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.280]   on the long history of God's great work."
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.680]   And so Christians, one of the practices we regularly have is we look back, right?
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.280]   We look back on the incredible works of God.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.380]   Incredible works of God in drawing the nation of Egypt out, the Great Exodus.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.380]   Incredible miracles of God to protect and to preserve.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.580]   Incredible works of God to win battles, to raise nations, to destroy nations,
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.380]   to deliver and redeem.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.580]   Incredible works of Jesus to heal, to even raise from the dead.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.480]   Does that mean history was sanitized of all suffering and pain?
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.380]   No.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.380]   Mankind's history has still been riddled with all sorts of pain and suffering.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.280]   But what we're talking about is this.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.580]   It's an issue of faith.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.980]   It's an issue of faith to not use just my experiences, just my eyes, and to doubt
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.080]   whether God is there or not, but to believe with our hearts that God is still nevertheless
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:11.180]   absolutely powerful and that he is absolutely present with that power.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:18.480]   You see, I think many of us have the temptation to wonder, look at our lives,
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.080]   and to conclude either God must not care or God must not be powerful enough.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.780]   Today we're going to be looking at a specific example in the life of Christ,
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:38.280]   in a life in the history of mankind, where Christ has proven to be both.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.880]   To be so compassionate, to be there in the immediate presence of the most pressing
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.080]   needs of mankind, but also to exhibit incredible power, proving himself to be worthy of all praise.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.980]   So let's take a moment now to turn to Matthew chapter 8.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.380]   Okay, Matthew chapter 8.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.280]   And in Matthew chapter 8, verses 1 and down, what happens is Jesus,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.780]   he just had a mass of people follow him, hearing his great authoritative preaching,
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.980]   famously called the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.880]   As he's coming down from the mountain, various people approach him.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:20.080]   A leper, a centurion gentile, Peter's mother-in-law, and Jesus miraculously heals them.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.580]   Boom, boom, boom.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.180]   Let's take a moment to start reading here in Matthew chapter 8, verses 1 through 4.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.880]   When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.980]   and a leper came to him and bowed down before him and said,
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.780]   "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.680]   Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing, be cleansed."
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.380]   And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:54.180]   And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.580]   and present the offering that Moses commanded as a testimony to them."
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.580]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.680]   Our Heavenly Father, we thank you, God.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.280]   We know that you are powerful. You are the creator of the world.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:16.980]   We know, Father God, that perhaps recreating a limb, perhaps making a man whole again,
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.180]   those are nothing for you.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.780]   But we also thank you, God, that that power you exhibit, you say,
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:28.380]   the power that you exhibit in Christ, you exhibit towards us in our salvation,
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:34.780]   God, in the redemption of our souls, in the healing, Father God, for us for eternity.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.080]   And so, Lord, we thank you.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.480]   Right now, as we look upon your word, I pray that God, through your spirit,
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.380]   your word would work mightily within our minds and within our hearts.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.780]   We thank you in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.880]   So, we read that short four verses, and as I was studying the passage,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.980]   I just, at one moment, just prayed, like, "God, I wish you would have wrote more."
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.980]   This is an incredible story.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:07.780]   We believe Jesus, with a touch and word, made a man who was so sickly,
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.180]   disease-infested, instantaneously clean.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.880]   We believe that.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.880]   We believe in the power of Christ. Amen.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.980]   The world will be like, "Okay. Right? Sure.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.280]   What else does he have to help me in my life?" Right?
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.980]   But what we're doing is camping down and realizing Christ exhibited such power
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.880]   that all he had to do was, again, in one short phrase,
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.380]   he touched him and he healed him. That was it.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.980]   But what we're going to learn from this whole scenario is to look
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.180]   at the faith of the leper who believed in that power. Right?
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.580]   We're going to dissect and see the leper who came, approached Jesus,
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.180]   requested and asked and humbled himself before the Lord,
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.780]   what is contained in his mind and his heart that he would come to the Lord in this fashion?
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:04.280]   That's the question. What faith of the man who is the leper?
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.980]   Now, we've been doing this study in the book of Hebrews, talking about great faith.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.480]   And we said that this faith that the people had, it wasn't just an intellectual assent.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.280]   It was substantive. Right? It was substantive.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.280]   The things that are unseen, exhibited in the faith of those godly individuals.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.280]   And today, it's just kind of a mini version of that.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.080]   And the individual here in Matthew chapter 8.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.980]   The very first point I have for you then is this.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.480]   This leper clearly believed the power of Christ
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.680]   and therefore risked great public shame. Okay?
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.880]   He clearly believed in the power of Christ and that's why he risked great public shame.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:52.280]   The passage just simply starts with such a mundane way of saying the leper came and he bowed before him. Right?
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:59.180]   But in the other corollary passages, this story is recorded in both the Gospel of Mark and Luke as well.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.080]   In the Gospel of Luke, the author describes it and says,
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.280]   "Behold, there was a man covered in leprosy."
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.980]   A little bit more descriptive.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.380]   But you notice how there is that kind of almost superfluous way of saying,
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.480]   "Behold!" Right? Getting your attention.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.280]   And rightly so. Why?
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.780]   Because a leper would never come into the crowd.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:30.080]   You see, back in the old day, the leper had no authority,
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.280]   had no right, and actually a legal prohibition for him to enter into the crowd.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.180]   When we study this passage, I hope you can do the whole mental picture with me.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.680]   We said earlier that Jesus was teaching on the mount and there was a crowd.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.980]   How big was that crowd?
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:52.280]   What it says earlier, prior to Matthew chapter 5, when the story begins of his discourse,
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.480]   is that people from regions all around came to him.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.580]   So when we see a crowd like this for us, having a group this size is already big.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.380]   This is about a hundred people in the room.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.780]   Before pandemic, this room held 400 people. That was big.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.580]   I mean, at that point, you couldn't even know the names of the people in the room.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.880]   But when you think about scenarios like that, that was a hundredfold more than that.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.780]   It was not uncommon for Jesus to feed. Remember the 5,000?
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.880]   It was not uncommon for Jesus to teach in masses well over 5,000 people,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.780]   including if there were male, female, and even children.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.080]   So you're talking about a massive group of people.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.280]   And remember, there was such a stir.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.780]   This could be the Messiah.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.980]   We're talking about a huge group of people.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.980]   So picture that, a massive group of people moving together,
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.480]   following Jesus as he's coming down the mountain.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.980]   And the leper comes.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.880]   I mean, I'm going to right now try to describe to you what the leper is,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.180]   but right now we're in the middle of COVID.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.380]   Imagine back in March when you started hearing of there was a disease
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:03.480]   that was spreading in China, in Wuhan, and people were dropping.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   There were stories and rumors of people having fever, coughs.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.780]   Can you imagine being the individual?
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.780]   I'm from Wuhan. I have a severe fever.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.180]   I have some symptoms of heavy coughing, heavy breathing.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.080]   You couldn't force people to come near you.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.780]   People would just run, okay?
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.680]   In many ways, that's how it was.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:33.380]   For a leper, a leper was an individual so distinctly riddled with disease.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.680]   The passage says he was covered in leprosy.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.380]   Well, if you don't know, leprosy, the term itself,
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.580]   both in the Hebrew and the Greek, means scaly.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.380]   Why? Because this disease attacked the flesh.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.280]   People would have ulcers, boils, and sores.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.780]   It would be discolored.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:58.680]   Your skin on the face would look scaly like it was that of a reptile almost.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.980]   I looked it up on Google and then regretted it, right?
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.780]   I was tempted to show you.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.780]   I'm going to leave it to you.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.980]   Go look it up sometime.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.680]   The thing about it is, yes, I just, I'm thinking about it in terms of the devastation,
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.480]   but right now it's not common. You don't see it.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.180]   But it is present in some of the more rural areas in certain countries.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.880]   In the Philippines, there are cases.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.580]   In India, there are cases.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.780]   Right now, the cases are a lot lower, but it's still going on.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:34.080]   And the thing about it is, in those scenarios, it is so difficult to treat
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.480]   because this disease affects every part of you.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.880]   Let me go on.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.280]   This disease not only affects the skin,
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.480]   it attacks the nervous system so that you cannot feel.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.180]   And this disease was called the disease that mimics everything.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.380]   Why?
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.480]   Because it's not so much that it had this kind of infection and bacteria like everything else,
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.980]   but what it is, is if you get a cut,
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.080]   can you imagine getting a cut and not being able to feel it?
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.180]   You would get infections because you wouldn't be able to treat it.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.980]   Can you imagine not being able to feel?
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.580]   If you're using a tool and that tool is ripping into your skin,
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.380]   not being able to feel it?
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.680]   If you had certain pains, not being able to feel it?
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   And so people would literally rub away certain parts of their skin
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.380]   because they couldn't feel it.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.280]   It attacked the nervous system and the tendons
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.880]   so that your fingers and your extremities would be drawn in
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.580]   and people would have essentially claw-like hands.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.480]   It would attack your bones and it would become brittle
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.880]   and individuals would lose pieces of their, again, their fingers and their toes.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.580]   There's a lot of picture of people who have lost their noses, their ears.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.980]   This would also attack the eyes and so many individuals after years would die of,
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.580]   I'm sorry, would go blind.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.380]   It would attack the vocal cords.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.880]   And so a long time ago there was this movie with Charlton Heston
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.480]   on Ten Commandments or even Ben-Hur.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.280]   And within those movies there are people with leprosy
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.780]   and they would always have this incredibly raspy voice.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.280]   That was because the disease would ravish their vocal cords.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   Why am I describing all of this to you?
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:14.780]   Because when the passage says, "Behold, there was a man covered in leprosy,"
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:23.180]   this individual was distinctly, apparently, obviously, to the naked eye, diseased.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:28.280]   And to go beyond that, lepers were given these clothes that they would wear
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.380]   and they would have to yell out, "Unclean, unclean!"
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.580]   Did you know that the law within both tradition
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.380]   required a certain amount of distance between an individual and a leper?
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.280]   A leper had to keep that distance.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.080]   And what's interesting, over tradition and time,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   they said a leper had to keep minimum six feet distance.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.480]   So 1.2 meters, right?
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.680]   They had to. They had to keep that distance.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.080]   And so what I'm saying is, you don't even almost have to say "Behold,"
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.480]   because in a massive crowd, to say that this man was a sticking-out sore thumb
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.880]   would be an understatement.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.580]   You would imagine then the crowd moving and this individual coming to Jesus,
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.980]   and most likely the crowd would be like, "What are you doing?"
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.280]   I would imagine this certain individual saying,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.880]   "No, there's other people who need to be healed. You stay back over there."
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:28.380]   When I say that this individual, because he believed Christ to be powerful enough to help him,
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.380]   he risked it all. He truly did.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.180]   Because not only did he risk the shame of everybody saying, "Look at that leper!
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.980]   Watch out, watch out, watch out! Pulling the kids back!"
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.180]   You can imagine this. "Pulling the kids back! Don't go near him! Cover your mouth!"
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.980]   Did you know that they believed, and it was proven to be true,
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.380]   that leprosy was transmitted through droplets from the mouth and from the nose?
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.580]   And so they had this thing, you had to keep all distance.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.780]   This individual risked everything because he was in risk of breaking the law.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.380]   This individual risked everything because he was actually in risk of being stoned to death.
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:10.080]   Tradition had it that if you see a leper out of his place, walking down the street,
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.580]   you essentially had an unwritten code, you could stone him.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.780]   And sadly to say, some of the first people to throw the first stone would be the priests,
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.480]   to show that person is unclean.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.880]   You could see why that by the description of what leprosy is,
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.280]   it was used as a depiction of sin.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.180]   That it desensitized you, that it killed you outside, inside.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.880]   And biblically speaking, it caused you to be ceremonially unclean.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:47.480]   This individual was radically dejected from the society.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:55.780]   Why do I bring this stuff up? It's because all of this was obvious to everybody.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.980]   But it required the faith that Christ could do something for him to come out.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:06.280]   For him to not try to some in meager way to save face.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:11.280]   Let me quickly turn it to us, sometimes our perpetual desire to save face
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.980]   prevents us from experiencing the power of God.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:23.680]   Our feeble attempt to somehow self-preserve prevents us from going to the Lord, to draw near.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.280]   You know Christ has come, you know he's drawn near,
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.180]   you know that he desires for all to come to him.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:36.780]   But if this leper wallowed in the, "I am rejected by society, I know I am unclean,
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.480]   I know I am filthy, I know I am diseased,"
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.180]   then he would have just stayed in his camp.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.980]   But my guess is if you picture the scene,
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.280]   maybe he was hiding out on the side of the crowds,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.680]   maybe he was hiding behind a structure or a bush,
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:59.580]   I am guessing he heard the authoritative preaching of Jesus and said, "That man has power."
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.380]   He believed it.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:09.180]   That would be the only rational line and reason for him to go and risk all of that,
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.180]   potentially being stoned by even the religious leaders.
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.680]   Now moving forward then to number two,
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:21.980]   the leper believed in the power of Christ and therefore humbled himself to worship.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.180]   He believed, he must have believed in the power of Christ,
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.680]   because look at the way he worshipped.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   It says that the leper came and he bowed himself down before Jesus, right?
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.380]   That word for bow down is proskuneo.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.380]   As you guys know, Greek, very just extensive language, has multiple terms.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.580]   There's lots of terms for worship, adoration, and praise,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.080]   but this specific term, if you've heard it before,
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.180]   proskuneo means to prostrate oneself, which means to bring low.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.480]   So Mark chapter 1 verse 40, it says that he fell on his knees.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.080]   Luke chapter 5, it says he fell to his face.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.080]   The common practice of the day was that when you find somebody who is superior to you,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.880]   you would come and then you would lower yourself and put your forehead to the ground.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.280]   It is an act of saying, "I am unworthy to look at you in this fashion."
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.780]   This was an act of worship.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.080]   Proskuneo was used predominantly as a means to show adoration.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.580]   The way that it's used commonly is to actually like interpret it in another,
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.080]   I guess translate it in other works of literature, is to send a kiss.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:37.580]   Not a romance, okay, it's not blowing a kiss, but like a kiss of homage.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.780]   If I can paint a picture for you, sort of movie analogy.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.280]   Have you guys seen those Italian mobster movies?
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.880]   You know what happens?
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.080]   It's the Don, right, Don Corleone.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.880]   He comes and all he does is extend his hand.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.680]   What do the people do?
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.780]   You've got grown men who lean down and, you know.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.680]   Have you guys ever done that to somebody?
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.580]   If you've ever done that to anybody, that person receiving it would probably be like,
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.780]   "What are you doing? You mocking me?"
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.880]   Because it's so outlandish, it's so expressive in its show of homage.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.080]   Back then when there was such hierarchy, people did that.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.380]   But imagine this.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.180]   It's not even a bow to kiss the hand.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:25.880]   Now it's, "I'm going to go all the way down, falling on his face."
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.680]   What am I talking about here?
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.780]   Look at the leper's faith.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.680]   He recognizes his inferiority.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.280]   He recognizes Jesus' superiority and he goes down to the floor.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.580]   Right?
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.080]   Contrast that.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.280]   Contrast that with what the common day thought was about Jesus.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:52.480]   At this time, early on in the ministry, there was so much conjecture about who Jesus was.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.780]   Later on even, even later on into the story of Jesus' ministry,
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.780]   Jesus asked the disciples directly, "Who do you say I am?"
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.580]   Do you guys remember what they said?
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.080]   "Well, some say you're Elijah. Some say you're Jeremiah.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.580]   Some say you—you gotta be one of them prophets, right?"
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:13.980]   People were not sure, but this leper got it.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:20.280]   "You're clearly one cent of God, powerful enough to meet my need."
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.780]   Yes?
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:28.080]   When we're talking about this specific scenario, what you see is a man convinced,
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.980]   "This man deserves worship."
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:36.780]   Because in this culture, if the individual was a Jew, you dare not worship any man.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.280]   Right?
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.680]   And amongst the Jewish culture, if you were receiving worship,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.980]   you would be like, "No, no, no, no, no, don't do that, because I'm just a man."
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.980]   And if you tried to give worship to something that was not God,
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.680]   you would be like, "Blasphemy! Stone him!"
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:58.680]   What this man is doing is recognizing the power of Christ.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.480]   And so he goes down to worship.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.680]   For every single one of us, what a challenge.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:12.580]   The faith of the leper to recognize the power of Christ and to humble himself in worship.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.080]   Spurgeon says it in an intense way,
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:21.280]   "Those who call on Jesus but do not worship him are more diseased than this leper."
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:28.680]   In his commentary, he says, "If you're so blind that you can't see Jesus, you are blinder than the leper."
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:34.080]   "If you cannot give worship, you must have not seen the light of Christ," is what he's saying.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.980]   I want to address this a little bit.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:45.080]   We here at Berean, we focus in on the sufficiency, the authority, and the power of the Word of God,
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.780]   which is appropriate and true to what the Word proclaims.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.680]   So rightly so, we must be people of the Word.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.980]   That's good.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:03.680]   The danger for people who are focused on the Bible is to make their spiritual experience one of intellect.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.980]   And so sometimes I hear people talking about their Christian faith from before,
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:14.380]   in terms of God's work in their life, and in terms of currently, how they are growing, all in terms of intellect.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.380]   You know, I became Christian earlier on.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.180]   My parents taught me the gospel and taught me the Bible.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.680]   And then there were some times when I studied it.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.380]   And then at a certain point, I started taking it more seriously and studying it more.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.280]   And then I got it.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.880]   It started clicking.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.580]   Now, some of us talk like that, and that's okay.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.180]   I'm not saying you can't talk like that, because I understand what you're saying.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.180]   You learn progressively the truths of God.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:44.480]   It convicted you, and at a certain point, it started hitting you more, and it started to make sense, and you understood.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.180]   Good.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:53.380]   But if you stop there, there's something missing that is shown in this passage.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:26:00.180]   Because if you ask the leper, if you ask the leper, "Did you get it?"
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:04.280]   He's going to say, "I saw Christ, and I surrendered."
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.980]   There is a huge difference when saying, "You know, at a certain point in my Christian walk, it started clicking.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:16.280]   I understood," versus, "You know, I saw Jesus, and I prostrated myself.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   I put myself at his mercy, because he is God."
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:27.080]   And there's an experiential part of Christianity where you come before the Lord, and you do this.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.780]   "Lord, I fall on my knees, because you're God.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.780]   I don't just get you.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.280]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   It doesn't just simply click.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.980]   I have surrendered to you."
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:49.980]   This man expressed—this is like, if you're talking about a movie scene, some dramatic scene where there's a whole crowd watching,
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.580]   this is one incredible scene.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.380]   How expressive—I'm guessing, I'm just assuming, reading between the lines here,
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.880]   that certain people are like, "What is this fool doing?
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.880]   Get away!"
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.580]   "We're trying to listen to his teaching.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.380]   Get away from us!"
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.180]   And he bows before the Lord and says, "Lord!"
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.880]   It only records—I wish it recorded more.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:17.680]   It only records one phrase, but I'm pretty sure this leopard said more.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.980]   "Lord, you have power.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.080]   You have authority."
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.280]   And in that way, I challenge every single one of us.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:35.580]   Our faith is a reactionary worship to seeing the great light of Christ.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.280]   And clearly, what we learn from this leopard is he saw the power of Jesus.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:48.380]   Let's move on to the next point, which is, the leopard believed the power of Christ, and he asked for cleansing.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:53.580]   This leopard believed upon the power of Christ, and he asked for cleansing.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:28:00.080]   Scripture again in Matthew says, "When he came down from the mountain, a large crowd followed him,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.680]   and a leopard came to him and bowed down before him and said, 'Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.'"
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.080]   Now, in this passage, it's not even a question.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.280]   It's just a statement.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.780]   "I believe you are so powerful, it's not even an issue.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.280]   The only question is, will you?"
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.180]   Do you see that?
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.180]   He's not asking, "Can you?"
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.680]   "What did you do with me? Why? How come?"
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.180]   And think about this.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.280]   Back then, families were typically pretty big.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.580]   I'm assuming this individual perhaps had family who could not touch him or see him.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.080]   Why is it that my brother is clean and I am not?
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:40.580]   It perhaps is a very plausible scenario.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.080]   But rather than asking those questions, he is asking the question,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.280]   "Lord, are you willing?"
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.780]   Now, the reason why I said it's a question is because the other passages, Luke 5, verse 14,
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.580]   talks about how he implored the Lord Jesus.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.180]   So he is begging and asking.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:05.280]   He's saying to the Lord, "Christ, Jesus, I believe in your power.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.080]   And only if you're willing, I know I will be clean."
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.780]   And it's just like the centurion's faith.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:15.280]   The centurion said, "You don't even have to come to my house.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.580]   Just say the word, and my servant will be clean."
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.080]   That's faith. That's absolute faith.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.980]   But as I meditated upon this passage, please meditate with me.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.180]   I didn't want to make too much of this, "And he asked," or "He said the statement," you know,
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:36.880]   and I'm making a big deal about it, but let's take a moment to meditate.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.680]   This individual asked something that was obvious.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.980]   He was covered in leprosy.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.380]   He was clearly deformed in some way or another.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.380]   Did he have to ask?
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:57.380]   And as soon as I started thinking that, I felt a conviction in my heart.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:03.180]   Because there's something stubborn in me that doesn't want to ask, right?
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:08.780]   There's something weird about asking that makes you feel a little bit less.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.980]   So you turn to other things to get what you need or want.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.680]   Let me give you an example.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.280]   Now, we have perhaps all dealt with an individual who you know they want something,
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   but they're all manipulative.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.280]   So they use things like complaining, throwing a tantrum, right?
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.680]   Crossing their arms and giving you cold shoulders, like, fine then.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.480]   Don't want it either, right?
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.780]   Like, and they'll maybe even complain.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.280]   Like, "You did it for them.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.180]   What about me?"
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:35.980]   You know?
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.780]   And now it's always a question of like, "Are you being fair or not?"
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:44.680]   Like, and then you're just kind of thinking, "Just ask me," right?
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.980]   We have perhaps seen other people where they offer up better plans.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.380]   They give you advice, but then you recognize, like, you have conflict of interest.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.080]   All your plans result in you getting what you want.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.180]   I want you to recognize that many people have done that to Christ.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.880]   "Jesus, why don't you…you know what?
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.980]   Why don't you make…be king?
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.980]   We'll make you king."
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:11.180]   And then what that does is we want you to be king because then we usher in the revolution of the Jews, right?
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.680]   Like, it's so self-interested.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.980]   We do that.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.580]   And the reason why I say this is because I do that, right?
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.780]   You…there are certain things you feel that you need, you're deficient.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.880]   Maybe you feel pain, you feel suffering.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:35.380]   And rather than asking the Lord, maybe you're fighting your sin, maybe you're…whatever it may be.
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:41.580]   There is this weird categorical pride in me that doesn't want to ask.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:48.380]   And then even in marriage relationships, quick dating tip, because you guys know I love to give those, right?
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:55.080]   Sometimes you play a game in romantic relationships where you're not too direct with asking stuff.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.680]   Because it's weird if you…in a dating relationship, it's like, "I want to ask you, will you love me?"
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.480]   You know, like, "Will you take care of me?
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.080]   Will you be all affectionate?
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.580]   Hug me."
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:10.080]   You know, like…and then all of a sudden, you look like this really needy person, okay?
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:19.280]   But the reason why I bring that up is because there is this little phrase that I've often caused relationships to go sour.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:25.580]   "I don't want to have to ask you to care for me and consider me.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:33.280]   And if you go, right, to the fridge to get a cold drink, do I have to ask you every time, 'Can you get me one too?'
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.780]   Why can't you just think of me and bring me one?"
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.780]   Okay?
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.680]   You guys have never said that?
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.980]   A lot of times in relationships, they do that to each other.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.980]   "I don't want to have to ask you for affection and consideration.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.380]   I don't have to beg you for stuff.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.380]   You should know."
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.780]   And then you realize, there it is.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:00.880]   I have a problem asking for stuff because when it's super obvious, and again, he had
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.980]   to ask for the obvious.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:11.880]   Everybody could see what his problem is, but he humbled himself to ask, "Lord, would
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.780]   you make me clean?"
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:24.680]   Within that question, there is a willingness to place oneself at the mercy of his will.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.380]   And that's when it hurts our pride in human relationships.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:33.080]   It places me somehow at your mercy.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.780]   And I want to challenge every single one of you.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:39.480]   Yes, from human to human, you don't want to act like that needy person who's always asking
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   for everything.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:40.980]   Why?
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.480]   Because scripture says in many different scenarios, "Bear your own burden so long as
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.380]   it determines on you, don't owe people anything."
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:48.880]   Right?
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.380]   Don't be a burden.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.980]   Don't be a free bird.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:34:01.380]   But between you and our God, between you and Christ, the reality is you need everything
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.880]   from his merciful hand.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.380]   The reality is, the situation is, he is of power.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.380]   You are of need.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.080]   That's the reality.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.680]   By faith, we should be very comfortable humbling ourselves and saying, "God, you have the
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.480]   power to meet my need."
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.180]   And scripture says, "These are the people who will be blessed."
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:36.080]   In Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31, "Yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.580]   They will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, and they
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.380]   will walk and not become weary.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:50.780]   Behold," oh sorry, I'm going to read another passage, Psalm 123, "Behold, as the eyes of
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:56.480]   servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of their
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:03.280]   mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God until he is gracious to us."
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.580]   You see, the world will see that and say, "What?
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.280]   I'm no servant?
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.880]   I'm no slave?
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.080]   I'm no maid to a mistress?
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.680]   You want me to ask and sit there and wait for him to answer?"
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.980]   And the flesh will rebel in that fashion.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.780]   Biblically speaking, what we're saying is just as obvious as the disease of a man of
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.880]   great leprosy, so is your sin.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.980]   So is your great need.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.780]   It isn't obvious.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.980]   We are covered in sin.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.580]   We are so deeply in sin.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.080]   And it's only us who fool ourselves to try and save face.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.880]   But when we humble ourselves to ask, we will be blessed.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:58.580]   Lastly then, lastly, like the leper, we must believe that the Lord is willing.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:04.880]   The leper believed in the power of God, but the leper believed that the powerful Lord
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.280]   is willing.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.080]   Let me read to you what it says.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:17.480]   "Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, 'I am willing!'
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.380]   He cleansed, and immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.780]   I wish I could have been there.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.580]   I mean, if there is an incredible, dramatic scene, something just epic, you have thousands
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.580]   of people watching.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:36.480]   You could probably have a commotion like, "Gasp!
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   Jesus touched him!"
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   Right?
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   That's forbidden!
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   "Gasp!
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   Jesus is unclean!
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   Gasp!
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   Doesn't he know?"
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.080]   This is an epic moment.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.280]   But what they see is not Jesus being contaminated.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.180]   They see the man be cleansed.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:04.780]   And to us, those words, "I am willing," that's incredible.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:11.780]   And to us, that simple act, "Jesus touched him," that's beautiful.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.880]   The thing about it is, Jesus didn't need to touch him!
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.880]   The very next story is, I don't even need to go there!
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.280]   I just say the word and it is so!
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.480]   That's how powerful our Lord Jesus is!
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:32.780]   Jesus touching him is a ministering of compassion to the one who is weak and feeble.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.880]   Imagine with me the life of a leper.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.580]   Not even his parents can touch him.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.280]   He's an untouchable, unapproachable.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:51.080]   If there was somebody who was an outcast on the outskirts of society, this would be it!
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.880]   But Jesus approached and touched him!
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:38:00.280]   I can imagine just the tears in the man's eyes, just flowing out of thankfulness.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.680]   As a matter of fact, I could even imagine the man going, "What are you doing?
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.280]   Don't touch me, Lord!"
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   Right?
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.080]   Because clearly the man respected him.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.680]   And he knew himself.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.480]   And I imagine this scene, the leper reeling back, like, "Gasp!"
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.680]   And then Jesus touching him and him feeling cleansed from head to toe.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.380]   That's crazy stuff!
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.380]   This is the most incredibly beautiful scene.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.480]   And so Jesus addressed every part of it.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   It was instantaneous.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:37.040]   He didn't say, "Got medicine, vaccine, take two a day."
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:42.800]   It was miraculous, instantaneous, in the moment, it was perfect!
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:49.680]   But what's really astounding about this is Jesus proceeds to say, "I am willing."
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.280]   Brothers and sisters, this is the gospel.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:59.800]   Scripture says that God on his own initiative, he purposed before the foundation of the world
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:07.400]   to take sinners lost and condemned like ourselves, and to hold and have us, to love us, to redeem
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.200]   us, to adopt us, and to perfect us.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:18.800]   That was all done, Ephesians chapter 1, according to the kind intention of his will.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.880]   God had to have done nothing.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.520]   He doesn't have to do anything.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.840]   He doesn't have to be, "Oh, that guy got it.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.280]   I had no sickness.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   He has sickness.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   Why is it?"
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.760]   No, he doesn't have to do anything.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:43.360]   Scripture says in Hebrews chapter 2, you see, angels fell, humans fell, but God so desired
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:50.760]   to be of help to the children of Abraham, and when he did, he sent his son.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:55.480]   Brothers and sisters, if you are going through hard times, I began with Psalm chapter 77.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.880]   "Lord, have you forgotten me?
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.200]   Are you going to reject me forever?"
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.200]   He says, "You held my eyelids open."
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.880]   That means he can't sleep because it bothers him so.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.720]   I will remember the mighty deeds of God.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:18.520]   I want to ask you, this leper is showing to us a model of faith to believe in the power
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   of Christ.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.520]   Amen?
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.000]   Do you have that conviction?
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.080]   My Lord is near and he is willing.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.200]   He is compassionate and he is powerful.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.600]   By the simple word, he healed him.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.240]   After this story, he healed the next and the next and the next.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.000]   Actually, Scripture says he healed.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.160]   As he was teaching, he healed many.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.480]   To write of it would fill books and books and books.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.760]   This is our Lord.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.600]   Do you believe he is willing?
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   I want to say to you guys that as I was preparing this passage, there was an individual where
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:04.320]   I was counseling and I was afraid he had suffered deeply.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.480]   He wasn't like a Job story, but he had suffered in a way where I thought, "I don't know what
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:13.360]   to say to you because if I say stuff to you wrong, I might offend you."
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.560]   I'm not going to say, "Hey, look on the bright side."
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.760]   The guy has suffered to the degree where I was just so careful.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.080]   Maybe too careful because there was a part of me that wanted to share with him parts
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.640]   of my devotion and say to him, "Our God is proven powerful."
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.600]   Because I worried, what if he comes back and is like, "Well, not with me.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   Don't tell me those stories."
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:43.160]   Because yeah, maybe God is powerful with them, but not with me.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.520]   I want to remind you.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:51.840]   Remember Daniel and his friends?
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   He had this confidence.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.680]   "Our God is so powerful, he will deliver me from your hand."
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   Right?
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   Remember that?
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.480]   Then the guy said, "You're going to burn in my furnace.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.400]   You're going to die in my oven."
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.920]   They said, "God's either going to draw us out miraculously or we're going to die in
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.760]   there, but either way, God will deliver us."
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:18.440]   Brothers and sisters, in terms of what God is willing to do, God is willing to do far
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.080]   more than give simple help.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:26.480]   He wants to deliver you eternally, to give you perfection.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.900]   For what good is it for a man to gain health, but to have a vicious heart, to have an eternity
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.960]   of corruption and condemnation?
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   It's worth nothing.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:46.440]   But Christ, he is willing that you would have life and life eternal.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.560]   And in that compassion and in that love, he has poured out his life for us.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   Amen?
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:56.920]   And that to us, we're reminded here that our Lord is willing.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.240]   We know what he's willing of.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:05.920]   And as humble servants, as those who we know we were stricken with sin, we wait eagerly
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.360]   for our Savior.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:12.840]   I want to conclude with this interesting thought.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:18.160]   In Matthew 8, verse 4, Jesus says something that's a little bit persuasizing.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:25.200]   And what he says is this, "See to it that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.760]   the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded as a testimony to them."
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.160]   I give you a warning.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.240]   The challenge is, believe on Christ's power.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:42.160]   And when you believe, that faith will cause you to draw near, that faith will humble you,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.640]   that faith will cause you to ask and then to receive the blessing of God.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.820]   But there's a warning.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.000]   You might not see it apparently, but here is the warning.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:01.360]   Jesus commands the man to go and do a fulfillment of the law process, which is in Leviticus
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.520]   chapter 13 and 14, God had commanded many things pertaining to the instruction of a
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.520]   leper.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:15.520]   Number one, he had to go show himself to a priest to affirm, "Do I really have leprosy?"
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.920]   And if you're confirmed, you are to isolate yourself and call yourself unclean.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.220]   You know what's crazy?
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.200]   That bulk of it was only four verses or five verses in Leviticus chapter 13.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.320]   The rest is all about what do you do when the leper is cleansed.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   Weird thing.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.480]   I tried to think about scriptural passages when the leper was cleansed.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   Can you think of any?
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.640]   I thought of one, Naaman.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   Naaman went to the king, Jerurim I think was his name, because he heard that there was
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.320]   a prophet healing there.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.360]   And when Naaman showed up, the king was like, "I'm not God!
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   I don't give life!
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.680]   What am I supposed to do with you?"
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.440]   Because clearly leprosy meant you're dead.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.080]   There was no solution for that.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.400]   And then after that, I can't think of it.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.000]   And then the fact of the matter is, if you look at Jewish tradition, if you were deemed
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.760]   to have leprosy, it actually records in Jewish Tamil tradition, they actually read the last
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   rites and kind of the sayings of the old upon your death to the person who just got it.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:18.480]   So imagine you go sick to the hospital, and then the priest comes in and starts reading
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.340]   your last verses.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.600]   But this was just a slow death.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.880]   It was just the thinking though was you're as good as dead.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.360]   That's almost cruel then, isn't it?
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.360]   Like, or weird.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.800]   It's kind of like getting an instruction manual to what to do when you win the lottery.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   And you're like, "I'm not going to ever!"
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   Right?
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.200]   What is this trash?
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:47.880]   To the Jewish leaders and Pharisees of the time, they should have been shocked.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.760]   For the first time in my life, I'm practicing Leviticus 13, 14.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.800]   What is this?
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.040]   The Jewish leaders should have been like, mind blown!
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.040]   That's the Messiah.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.080]   He has power.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.160]   He has authority over disease.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.660]   Because you know what the instructions are in Leviticus?
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:14.200]   When the man comes and he says he's cleansed, the Levitical priests, they essentially do
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   disease tracking.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.760]   Where were you?
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.760]   Did you really have it?
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.020]   Did you have the sores?
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.020]   What kind of sores did you have?
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.020]   What were the ailments?
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.020]   Were you really cleansed?
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:27.680]   And essentially, they do a check to make sure that this was a genuine miracle.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.680]   That was the law.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.520]   And so Jesus says, "Go show yourself."
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:41.640]   Jesus has done everything possible to convince the world that he is of God.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.640]   He is of God.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.960]   You know what the sad state of affairs is?
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   Matthew chapter 12.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.360]   Do you know what the Pharisees and the leaders conclude?
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.960]   "That must be a demon."
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.960]   So sad.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.960]   It's frustrating almost.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:05.160]   Below, and a warning to every single one of us, there is a weird temptation for us to
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:11.280]   not trust the power of Christ.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.360]   We run away when we should be running towards him.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.560]   We hide when we should be exposing.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:24.840]   We do so many things that believe that other people can help us, other programs.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.260]   It's not just the nation of Israel, and it's not just the Pharisees.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.960]   How many times has God said, "Trust me and me alone."
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.840]   Why do you keep making alliances with them?
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.840]   What is Egypt going to do for you?
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.240]   They have powers.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.960]   That's essentially what they're saying.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.880]   So I end with this warning because surprisingly, this passage is a warning.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:51.520]   It's a rebuke to the established culture and the religious leaders of the time.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.360]   What we need to believe is in the power and the willing compassion of Christ.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.720]   You are going to be tempted and lured by the world.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.720]   "No, trust me.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.720]   No, trust yourself.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.720]   No."
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.720]   But may we be of those humble like the leper.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.360]   "Lord, if you're willing, I'm going to be clean."
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   Amen?
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   Let's pray.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:23.040]   Father God, we thank you so much that in your Word, we have the answer to the question,
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.960]   "Are you willing?"
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.320]   Some of us, Father God, we wrestle with sin and it amazes us.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.600]   Like, "You're willing to forgive me?"
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   After how many times?
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:41.920]   I pray, God, we would believe that you have power, Lord, and that you're willing and compassionate.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:49.920]   I pray, Father God, for the faith to be humble, Lord, that resorting to my own devices, resorting
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.720]   to my own power means certain death.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.200]   And Lord, we must be humble enough to come to you and ask.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:03.720]   I pray, Father God, anybody in this room who is struggling through suffering and hard times,
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:08.280]   when they recognize that, Lord, your plan for them and your will for them is not to
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.960]   simply have ease here because you already told us we'll walk this life with great suffering,
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.640]   but God, to have such great hope.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.240]   To have you means we have everything.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.400]   To have you means we have the greatest power of all.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.080]   Lord, we thank you and praise you.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.080]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:26.580]   Amen.
