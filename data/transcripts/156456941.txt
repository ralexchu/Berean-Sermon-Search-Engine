[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   - Both Jews and Greeks are under sin.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.760]   As it is written, none is righteous, no not one.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.540]   No one understands, no one seeks for God.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.980]   All have turned aside, together they have become worthless.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.480]   No one does good, not even one.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.900]   Their throat is an open grave,
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.460]   they use their tongues to deceive.
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.560]   The venom of asp is under their lips.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.280]   Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.880]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.840]   In their paths are ruin and misery,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.480]   and the way of peace they have not known.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.160]   There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.960]   Now we know that whatever the law says,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.700]   it speaks to those who are under the law,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.640]   so that every mouth may be stopped
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.480]   and the whole world may be held accountable to God.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.800]   For by works of the law, no human being
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.340]   will be justified in his sight,
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.760]   since through the law comes knowledge of sin.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.600]   Let's pray.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:56.040]   We pray, Father God, that your word would speak to us,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.200]   it would go forth, it would produce fruits that you desire,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.180]   and it would not return until it has accomplished
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.020]   its purpose.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.940]   We pray, Father God, that your living word
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.920]   would be sufficient, that we would not look
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.760]   to the left or to the right, that we would meditate on it
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.480]   and not allow it to depart from us, Lord God,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.440]   that all the things that we desire to be fruitful in,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.320]   that we would cling to your word with all our might.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320]   We pray, Father God, that as Paul has written these words
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.020]   by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.100]   that your spirit, again, Lord God, would take these words
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.200]   and convict and guide and lead and feed us.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.680]   So we entrust this time to you, in Jesus' name we pray,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.520]   amen.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.080]   You know, you know what I've been noticing
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.720]   in the last maybe about a year or two
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.000]   that the fashion of the 1980s are starting to come back.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.080]   So those of you guys who weren't teenagers at that time
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.360]   may not be familiar, but some of the stuff
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.240]   that you guys are wearing now, I used to wear it, you know.
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.220]   In high school.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.620]   So I think nothing kills being cool
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.380]   than having your dad say, "I used to wear that."
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.060]   Like certain pants or certain glasses, and I remember.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.340]   So some of these things start to look very familiar.
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.700]   So every year, obviously, there's a cycle of things,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.180]   and I remember back then, too, and I remember
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.220]   I used to have teachers in junior high school
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.340]   and high school say that, "Oh, those thin ties
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.540]   "are coming back, I used to wear that in the 60s,
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.800]   "you know, or the 50s."
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.080]   And so, you know, fashion has a tendency
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.320]   to kind of like circulate, and it changes.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   But every single one of us, when it comes to what we wear
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.200]   and what we don't wear, we have a tendency
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.840]   to wear things that kind of accentuate our strength.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.060]   You know, there are certain parts of our body
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.760]   that we're not proud to show off,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.380]   so I always wear a loose jacket 'cause I don't have
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.520]   the figure that I wanna wear, a tight shirt
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.840]   that I used to do back in high school, right?
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.800]   So some of you guys have certain parts of your body
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.060]   that you want your legs to look a little longer,
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.520]   so you wear certain kind of pants,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.200]   or you do your hair a certain way
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.900]   'cause it looks a certain way.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.960]   So whatever it is that we wear, we have a tendency
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.000]   to wear certain things to accentuate our strength
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.460]   and hide some of our weaknesses, right?
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.520]   Well, we do that even when it comes to spiritual things.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.440]   We have a tendency to highlight the things
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.800]   that we're good at, and the things that we're not good at,
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.820]   we kind of keep it under wraps, and then, you know,
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.800]   we get offended when somebody pokes at it
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.360]   'cause we don't want anybody to see it
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840]   because those are things that are meant to be in the secret.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.760]   And because we have a tendency to do that, you know,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.080]   we, again, every single one of us is guilty of this.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.560]   We have a tendency to kind of like,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200]   this is how I wanna be perceived,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.320]   but in reality, behind the scene, we know that,
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.280]   we know our weaknesses, we know our struggles.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.480]   You know, I remember years ago,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.320]   evangelists would say this to kind of motivate people
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.600]   to live a righteous life, and he would say,
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.840]   you know, when you get to heaven,
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.920]   God's gonna have this videotape
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.400]   of everything that you've done, and he's gonna play it,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.440]   you know, so you better watch out, you know?
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.040]   Well, I wanna go a step further than that and ask you,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.600]   what if you think about the most shameful thing
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.360]   that you've ever done in life, okay,
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.520]   and don't say it out loud, okay?
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.120]   What if the most shameful thing
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.200]   that you've ever done in life
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.760]   that you probably may not even have shared with anybody,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.840]   maybe not even with your wife or with your husband,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.760]   and you just kind of maybe alluded to it,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.080]   but you were never really specific?
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.800]   So there, my guess is, from, again,
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.560]   years of counseling people and talking to people,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.880]   that every single person has something
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.040]   that they would be ashamed,
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.200]   if we were to have that videotape,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.560]   and it said that event, that thing
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.080]   that you've been trying so hard to hide,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.560]   or maybe you even did confess it
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.960]   because you're a righteous person,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.040]   but it wasn't really focused on,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.280]   you just kind of alluded to it,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.600]   but you didn't go into the specifics.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.720]   But what if we had a videotape of that particular thing
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.080]   that you did, whether you did that
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.480]   when you were a little kid,
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.400]   or whether that was last year, whatever it may be,
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.040]   and we start playing the video,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   like what kind of reaction would we have?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.600]   First thing, obviously, you know,
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.280]   response may be denial, it's like,
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.920]   no, no, that's not me, you know,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.800]   that video is kind of blurry, you know what I mean?
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.440]   That's not me, and then you look carefully,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.040]   and say, how can that not be you?
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.080]   You know, look at that hairstyle,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.200]   look at that little, you know, spot on your head,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.640]   that's gotta be you, right?
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.600]   So you go through a period of denial, you know,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.640]   maybe some shame, because now you're embarrassed,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.000]   because everybody's watching this,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.400]   and oh my gosh, you're mortified.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.160]   Maybe some anger, like why do you need to do that,
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.360]   why do you expose that, right?
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.480]   I've been trying so hard to keep it under wraps.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.640]   You might even take some time to justify it,
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.240]   you don't know the circumstance behind it,
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.840]   all you have is that little clip,
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.000]   you don't know what I went through,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   you don't know what those people did,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.560]   you don't know why I did this,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.000]   you don't know what my upbringing was like,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.640]   and maybe you will go through a period of justification.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.240]   And at some point after you've realized
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.960]   that there is just no way for you to deny this,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.000]   and you know in your heart that you're guilty of this,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.280]   that you will accept it.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.800]   And once you accept that you have no other way,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.600]   no other way to describe this,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.560]   no other way to describe it or get out of it,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.880]   eventually it will lead you to silence.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.960]   It's true, even in the court of law,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.420]   you see people who get arrested,
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.800]   and their first response is like,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.200]   no, that wasn't me, in denial,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.440]   and then all of a sudden they go into trial,
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.920]   and then one by one, you have witness after witness,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.360]   videotapes, circumstantial evidence,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.640]   direct evidence, and all of this is presented,
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.800]   and then through the whole trial it's clear,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.640]   without a shadow of a doubt,
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.800]   that this guy is guilty.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.240]   So by the time the sentencing comes,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.960]   he sits there and he just takes it,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.720]   whatever it may be, a life sentence,
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.640]   'cause he knows that he's absolutely guilty,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.720]   that he went through denial, shame, anger, justification,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.480]   and eventually he had to accept it,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.800]   because it's clear, and then he sits there silently
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.520]   as the judgment and the penalty is read out to him.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.280]   Everything that I just described to you
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.040]   is exactly what Paul has been doing for three chapters.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.240]   And as I mentioned to you last week,
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.160]   that's exactly what God has been doing
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.760]   in human history through the nation of Israel.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   He's been cutting through every part
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.000]   of the things that they have maybe have been justifying,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.200]   the shame that they've been hiding,
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.520]   the things that they've been comparing
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.000]   with other nations or other people,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.120]   and he's just chopping it down.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.600]   He's going into every crevice of their life
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.560]   that they feel like, you know what, these are things,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.760]   you know, I'm not as bad as them.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.160]   He's just kind of breaking it down.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.380]   And the reason for all of this is to bring us to silence.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.960]   Because until we are silent,
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.120]   until we recognize where we stand before God,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.060]   the good news of salvation really isn't good news.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.760]   You know, he said, the text that we just looked at
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.280]   this morning, it says, you know,
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.280]   those who are under the law can never be justified
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.660]   in his sight, since through the law
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.360]   comes the knowledge of sin, right?
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.840]   The reformers, John Calvin, it wasn't started
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.400]   by John Calvin, it was as early as Augustine.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   The church fathers put together a systematic understanding
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.600]   of how we are to understand the teaching
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.720]   of the law of the Old Testament.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.400]   There's a tendency today that we say,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.360]   well, we talk about the law,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.080]   immediately get a knee-jerk reaction
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.320]   that that's not meant to be practiced.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.880]   It's just to expose sin.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.800]   But they talk about three specific uses of the law.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.480]   And I'm gonna go backward.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.160]   The third use of the law, the ultimate purpose of the law,
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.440]   is actually that God intends that his people obey it.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.080]   It is what God intended.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.280]   And that's why Jesus says in John 14, 15,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.520]   if you love me, you will obey my commandments.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.600]   Now, I'm not gonna get too deep into that
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.960]   because that's not the point of this morning's text.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.720]   There's also what we call the civil law.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.920]   And that's the second use of the law.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.000]   And the second purpose of the law is to restrain evil.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.880]   Where God created a society, or community,
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.240]   where God says, if you commit this evil,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.600]   these things are gonna happen to you.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.000]   And so, even in the New Testament,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.440]   God says to submit to authority
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.160]   because all authority is established by God.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.400]   So that's the second use of the law.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.520]   But the third use of the law,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.080]   in reality, it's actually the first use of the law,
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.440]   'cause I read it backwards.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   Without the first use of the law,
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.920]   which functions as a mirror,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.240]   it functions as a mirror of God
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.200]   and ultimately mirror of who we are,
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.240]   that the other two use of the law,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.200]   whether it is a moral law or civil law,
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.560]   it will become absolutely useless.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.040]   Because the foundation upon which we build righteousness
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.680]   is first and foremost,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.240]   is based upon the first use of the law.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.240]   And that first use of the law is to reveal God's nature,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.520]   and by doing so, to reveal our sins.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.320]   Saint Augustine wrote,
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.120]   "The law's orders that we,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.760]   "after attempting to do what is ordered,
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.200]   "and so feeling our weakness under the law,
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.420]   "may learn to implore the help of grace.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.000]   "The law highlights our weaknesses
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.440]   "so that we might seek the strength found in Christ.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.280]   "Here the law acts as a severe schoolmaster
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.240]   "who drives us to Christ."
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.760]   You guys probably heard this phrase quite a bit
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.020]   from Thomas Watson, where he says,
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.520]   "Until sin is bitter, Christ will not be sweet."
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.960]   Until sin is be bitter, Christ will not be sweet.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.220]   No matter how much we highlight the love of Christ,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.840]   no matter how much we say how awesome his love is
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.120]   and how gracious he is,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.760]   until we come to a point where we recognize
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.240]   the bitterness of our sin,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.160]   grace is just words.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.280]   It's just a description of some theology.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.240]   It doesn't move us, it doesn't convict us,
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.220]   and even though we use the same words,
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.040]   justification, sanctification, glorification,
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.080]   these are just theological terms.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.560]   We don't respond in a way that somebody
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.440]   who has absolutely had no hope
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.680]   and can only find salvation in Christ,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.620]   in Christ alone.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.520]   In Romans chapter seven, seven through eight,
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.880]   it says, "What then shall we say,
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.040]   "that the law is sin?
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.320]   "By no means, yet if it had not been for the law,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.780]   "I would not have known sin,
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.220]   "for I would not have known what it is to covet
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.880]   "if the law had not said, you shall not covet."
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.100]   Let me stop right there.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.120]   He said, "If the law did not say you shall not covet,
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.100]   "I would not have known what coveting was."
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.920]   Are Christians the only people who know what coveting is?
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.880]   If you don't read the Old Testament,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   you say, "I didn't know that was lying."
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.240]   Adultery, I never read the Old Testament,
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.760]   so I didn't know, you know what I mean?
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.240]   Christian or not, whether you read the Old Testament
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.800]   or not, everybody knows what coveting is.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.000]   Everybody knows what adultery is.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.960]   Everybody knows what murdering and lying is.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.480]   So what does he mean when he says,
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.960]   "If it wasn't the law, I would not have known
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.200]   "what coveting was?"
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.080]   He's not simply talking about intellectually,
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.120]   because everybody knows intellectually
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.560]   that coveting, what coveting is.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.480]   Everybody knows it.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.300]   That's not just a Christian word.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.720]   That's just an English word.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.080]   It has it in every language.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.800]   What he is talking about is that conviction
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   of that particular sin,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   and how God views that sin through His holy eyes.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.880]   He said, "I would not have been convicted about this
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.520]   "if it wasn't for the law."
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.840]   That's exactly what, again, the author of Hebrews says,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.800]   in Hebrews chapter 4, 12,
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.960]   "For the word of God is living, and it is active,
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.760]   "it is sharper than any two-edged sword,
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.920]   "piercing to the division of soul and spirit,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.260]   "of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.720]   "and intentions of the heart."
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.320]   In NASV, the word for discerning is judging.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.960]   That the word of God is sharper than any double-edged sword,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.040]   and it judges the thoughts and intentions of our hearts.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.720]   It doesn't simply say, "Hey, this is what sin looks like.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.520]   "This is what coveting is.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.960]   "This is what murdering is."
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.200]   Because we all already know that.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.920]   What Paul is saying in Romans chapter 7 is,
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.400]   he says the word of God comes and convicts,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.840]   and he reveals to us the depth of that sin,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.900]   and how hideous that is before his eyes.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.360]   Same thing in the book of James, chapter 1, 23, 25,
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.720]   "For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.640]   "he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.500]   "in a mirror, for he looks at himself and goes away,
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.960]   "and at once forgets what he was like."
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.680]   The word of God functions as a mirror.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.760]   It reveals his holiness, and it reveals our sinfulness.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.280]   Every single one of you, before you came to church
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.160]   this morning, stood before a mirror.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.280]   I'm assuming every one of you.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.480]   Some of you may have not, and if you haven't,
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.600]   it's very evident.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.960]   Your hair's not combed, you got eye boogers hanging,
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.720]   you have no idea what you missed.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.240]   So everyone, we wanna avoid that embarrassment.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.920]   I mean, all of you guys have lived long enough to know
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.140]   that the good idea, right, is that you gotta stand
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.280]   before a mirror before you leave,
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.320]   and fix the problems before you come to church.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.080]   And years ago, when I was a youth pastor,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.240]   I remember having youth kids come to church,
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.440]   and you could tell right away those who just woke up.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.720]   And they didn't stand before a mirror
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.080]   because their hair is all sticking up on one side, right?
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.120]   And you could tell right away that that's the position
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.800]   they were in when they were sleeping,
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.520]   because their hair is all flat that way, right?
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.240]   And they just, basically, they realized
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.400]   they were late to church, they got up,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.160]   and they just came, right?
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.040]   They didn't get a chance to look into the mirror.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.920]   The Bible describes the law of God as a mirror.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.480]   And an individual who stands before the mirror
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.400]   and doesn't recognize their sin,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   and just walks away, is like that individual.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.480]   Who just kinda stand before the mirror,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.680]   it's like, oh, okay, there you go,
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.880]   and then you just walk away.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.360]   So when Paul says, without the law of God,
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.720]   we would not have known what sin was,
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.280]   he's not simply talking about the knowledge.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.660]   He's talking about the moral conviction
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.920]   over our sinful state.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.680]   That the word of God comes to convict us of our sins.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.040]   And so in 2 Timothy 3, 7, it says,
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.800]   in the end times, there's gonna be people
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.560]   who have a form of godliness and yet have no power.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.340]   It also describes it as always learning,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.300]   but never arriving at the knowledge of the truth.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.600]   Always learning, right?
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.640]   Now we could sit here and think,
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.900]   you know, I go to a Bible church,
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.500]   I attend Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.120]   Bible study faithfully.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.960]   I know what propitiation is,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.080]   I know justification, sanctification, glorification.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.200]   I know about dispensationalism versus covenant theology,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.640]   about pedo-baptism, believers baptism.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.660]   I know all of this.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.040]   I've been a Christian for a while,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.160]   maybe I even went to school,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.120]   took some Sunday school classes.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.080]   What do you mean always learning,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.880]   but not able to come to the truth?
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.040]   He's not simply talking about somebody who's at church
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.880]   and always, you know, like never attending Bible study
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.360]   and never reading and never having interest.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.000]   No, he says he's always learning.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.360]   He's always learning.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.720]   He's adding knowledge to knowledge.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.600]   Information upon information,
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.880]   but yet never coming to the knowledge of truth.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.640]   So what does he mean by knowledge of truth?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.140]   'Cause he's clearly not talking about information.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.120]   Knowledge of truth, again, is consistent
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.320]   with what he's been saying in Hebrews 4,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.080]   James chapter one, Romans seven.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.480]   Knowledge of truth is the conviction of sin
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.880]   to recognize who he is, not just intellectually,
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.160]   but morally, spiritually.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.500]   And as a result of that, you are convicted over your own sin.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:02.260]   You know, for Christians, for human beings in general,
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.320]   I think the hardest thing to do in life
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.760]   is to humble ourselves.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.040]   I know some of you guys are humble by nature,
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.320]   you know, or at least that's what you think,
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.760]   or people have told you that.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.560]   There's not a single human being who's humble by nature.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.420]   By nature.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.420]   Now, some of you guys, you know,
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.240]   are, tend to be more flamboyant,
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.800]   and you're more expressive, you know,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.860]   you talk more, and so, ah, that guy's not humble.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.620]   And then some of you guys are in the background,
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.100]   you know, like, quiet, and you don't talk a lot,
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.740]   so, oh, that person's very humble.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.020]   Nobody is humble by nature.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.620]   From the moment that we are born,
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.160]   we are motivated by self-glorification.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.340]   That's why you stood before a mirror today.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.160]   Because you want to make sure that
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.880]   people perceive you a certain way.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.200]   Even when you talk, it comes through a filter
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.840]   of self-glorification, because if I say this,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.980]   what are they going to think of me?
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.280]   So you've learned to adjust your language
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.160]   because you don't want to be perceived a certain way.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.840]   You're working hard at your work
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.000]   because you want to get better pay,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.920]   you want to be recognized, you want to move ahead in life.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.120]   You do certain things, or say things, or don't say things,
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.040]   and a lot of that, if not all of it,
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.300]   is motivated by self-glorification.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.840]   Humbling ourselves is the hardest thing to do.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.920]   You know, lying and stealing, stopping that
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.680]   is a lot easier than humbling ourselves.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.240]   Okay, let me tell you a secret.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.040]   If you're lying and stealing,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.400]   here's what you need to do.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.240]   Stop it.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.360]   Stop it.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.960]   That's a counsel.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.000]   We don't need to make an appointment,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.480]   I just dealt with that, right?
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.880]   Stop it.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.320]   Some of you have a hard time reading the Bible and praying.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.520]   There's an easy solution to that.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.720]   Read your Bible and pray.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.760]   There's no like this, oh, what's the secret?
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.200]   What, did you read Facebook today?
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.600]   Yes, well do that in front of the Bible, right?
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.320]   Do that in front of the Bible.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.760]   It's not a secret, it's not that hard to do, just do it.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.160]   It's just our problem is we don't have a priority straight,
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   and we get distracted, and it's just not important enough,
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.880]   and all this stuff, but in the end,
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.960]   if you really wanted to do it, you just do it, right?
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.400]   It's humbling ourselves, like reading the Bible,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.880]   praying, and disciplining, all this stuff
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.920]   is just a matter of you choosing to do it,
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.760]   and prioritizing it, and doing it.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.220]   But to humble ourselves before God's throne,
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.660]   it takes everything, because every inclination
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.560]   of who we are is to glorify ourselves.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.980]   Remember Adam and Eve's primary sin
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.300]   was they wanted to be like God.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.660]   The Tower of Babel, they wanted to be like God.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.460]   And human history, it's like we want a king
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.620]   like all the other nations.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.300]   We want this because we want to be more glorified.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.060]   What about us, is the kingdom now?
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.380]   Are you gonna restore the kingdom now?
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.620]   Everything is about self-glorification.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.960]   Even in our humility, we want to be recognized.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.220]   Nobody knows that I'm humble, right?
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.460]   I've been sacrificing so much, so selfless,
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.740]   and nobody recognizes it.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.360]   Even in our selflessness, we want to be recognized.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.200]   Even in our humility and gentleness,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.540]   we want to be recognized.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.780]   Every inclination that we have,
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.700]   innately, is self-glorification,
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.940]   whether you do it speaking loudly or softly,
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.420]   whether you do it publicly or privately,
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.980]   our inclination is about us.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.240]   We pursue righteousness for our own glory.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.820]   And so to humble ourselves,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.460]   and that's why we talked about 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.140]   one through three, we talked about how even,
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.380]   even if you speak of tongues of men and of angels
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.180]   and prophesy, even if you give everything
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.460]   you have to the poor, even when you are martyred
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.240]   for the name of Jesus Christ,
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.540]   we can do that all for our glory.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.380]   It's like, oh, I'm gonna go out in a blaze
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.700]   for name of Jesus, I'm gonna be martyred for Jesus.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.060]   But even in the context of being martyred,
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.680]   it could be for our glorification.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:27.580]   See, what Paul is doing, he's cut through all of that.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:34.220]   And the key to understanding our salvation
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.340]   is what he says in verse 19, and he says,
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.980]   "We know that whatever the law says,
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.980]   "it speaks to those who are under the law,
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.540]   "so that every mouth may be stopped,
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.860]   "and the whole world may be held accountable to God."
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.020]   Let me stop right there.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:53.820]   The whole point of what Paul has been doing,
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.060]   what God has been doing in human history,
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.140]   is summarized in verse 19, and I wanna apologize
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.540]   for what I'm about to say, so you don't get offended
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.620]   it's coming off of this pulpit.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.620]   Basically what he's saying is, shut up.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.580]   (crickets chirping)
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.940]   That's what he's saying, in a nice way,
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.300]   right, at least in the English version, right?
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.900]   Basically what he's saying is,
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.620]   after exposing all of our sins,
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.580]   after cutting through all of the justification,
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.660]   all of the anger, all of the excuses,
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.140]   and after cutting through all of that,
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.300]   he said the reason why he did that
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.860]   is to basically say, shut up!
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.580]   Listen, stop making excuses!
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.700]   See sin as God, see sin, do you recognize
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.660]   where you are before God?
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.660]   Keep your mouth shut, be quiet, I'm about to speak.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:54.220]   The greatest hindrance to our relationship with God
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.460]   is our self-justification.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:01.180]   Yes, we recognize sin, but we always have a stipulation.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.580]   Yes, I sin, but what about those people?
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.180]   Yes, I know I do what I, but isn't that just the way it is?
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.140]   Where do you draw the line?
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.340]   You don't know my circumstance,
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.860]   you don't know what my parents did to me,
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.060]   you don't know the background,
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.340]   you don't know the circumstance,
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.700]   you don't know my children.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.380]   The greatest hindrance in meeting Christ
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.020]   is self-justification.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.380]   You ever wonder the book of Job?
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.140]   Typically when people are suffering,
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.740]   we take them to the book of Job.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.660]   And we think, well, book of Job is about suffering
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.380]   and how God relieves suffering,
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.260]   how God has the answer for suffering.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.700]   Is that really the point of the book of Job?
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.060]   I want you to read book of Job,
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.740]   and on your spare time between break,
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.900]   just read through the book of Job,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.660]   and see if, forget all the sermons that you heard,
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.380]   forget all the Bible studies, just read the book of Job.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.180]   If you come out thinking, wow, in suffering,
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.740]   God is with us.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:08.700]   Because it begins with God opening the door to suffering.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.660]   Satan says, that guy is not,
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.060]   he's only righteous because you're protecting him,
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.260]   if you took away the hedge of protection,
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.140]   see what he does.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.660]   So he says, okay, and he takes it away,
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.140]   and God allows Satan to do all that he's doing.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.220]   But if you read the book of Job,
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.020]   Satan never appears again.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.580]   He appears in the beginning, and he begins the process,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.900]   and basically the whole book of Job
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.740]   is three cycles of three friends.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.340]   Nine separate times, three of his closest companions
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.780]   come to Job and saying, you are suffering
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.660]   because you must have done something wrong.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.140]   And each one of them, I mean,
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.340]   and the harder his life gets,
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.660]   the more harsher the criticism.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.740]   And it's three cycles of this.
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.980]   First, second, third friend, and then you think it's over,
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.700]   and then another, the first guy comes back,
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.020]   and first, second, third friend, and you think it's over.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.300]   And all this time, it's getting worse.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.380]   He loses his kids, his house, his wealth, his flock,
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.760]   his wife, he loses everything.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.180]   And at the end of it, you think,
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.980]   oh, his young friend Elihu comes,
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.300]   and he's gonna make things right,
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.540]   and he comes spewing, and say,
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.980]   oh, you guys are all wrong, and you gotta listen.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.100]   Basically, the accusation is,
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.660]   all this is happening because you must have sinned.
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.020]   You must have been faking it with all of us.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.420]   There must be something in your life
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.820]   that God is judging you for.
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.980]   So Job responds.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.780]   In Job chapter 31, verse six and seven, he says,
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.200]   let me weigh in in a just balance,
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.860]   and let God know my integrity.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.580]   In other words, you're wrong.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.940]   And he's gonna defend himself.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.940]   If my step has turned aside from the way,
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.700]   and my heart has gone after my eyes,
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.460]   and if any spot has stuck to my hands,
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.580]   then let me sow, and another eat,
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.740]   and let what grows for me be rooted out.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.660]   In other words, if I really did this,
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.180]   then I deserve this.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.260]   If what you're saying is true,
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.980]   there's some sin involved,
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.000]   and it was because of my sin I'm being judged,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.060]   then let me be judged.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.740]   So in other words, what he's saying is,
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.300]   but that is not right.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.620]   Because this is not true.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.500]   I am just before God.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.060]   And he's defending himself.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.340]   And he goes on and on.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.340]   Again, I only read you a small portion,
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.100]   but for chapters, he's going on and on,
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.980]   defending himself, and how righteous he is,
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.420]   and it is unfair for God to be judging him
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.500]   as he is being judged.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.780]   Again, Satan is never mentioned,
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.020]   because from the beginning, they recognize
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.380]   that only reason why all this is happening
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.940]   is because God is allowing it.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.580]   After he is done,
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.180]   God finally shows up in Job chapter 38, two through three.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.380]   It says, "Who is this that darkens counsel
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.940]   "by words without knowledge?"
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.640]   In other words, everything that Job's been saying,
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.780]   you have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.500]   "Dress for action like a man."
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.540]   I don't know why, every time I read that, it gets to me.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.980]   Dress for action, be a man,
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.140]   that's basically what he's saying.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.100]   "Pull up your skirts, get ready."
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.340]   Get ready, that's not what it says,
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.620]   I just read into that.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.940]   "Dress like an act, and act like a man."
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.420]   I will question you, and you will make it known to me.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.420]   You're questioning me, now I'm gonna question you.
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.740]   Now you answer me.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.140]   It says, "The Lord said to Job," in Job 41 through five,
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.100]   "Shall a fault finder contend with the Almighty God?"
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.800]   The fault finder basically means,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.520]   you've been accusing me now, right?
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.080]   All your friends have been accusing you,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.040]   and then now you're saying that all of them are wrong,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.080]   and now you're accusing me.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.660]   You, fault finder, now you're gonna contend with God, right?
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.000]   You're gonna make me justify myself.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.240]   He who argues with God, let him answer it.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.560]   Now you answer, you've been asking me,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.880]   now I'm gonna ask you.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.120]   Then Job answered the Lord and said,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.720]   "Behold, I am a small account, what shall I answer you?
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.960]   "I lay my hand on my mouth," in other words, I'm silent,
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.080]   now that God shows up, I have nothing to say.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.660]   How can I possibly contend with God?
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.140]   "I have spoken once, and I will not answer twice,
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.620]   "but I will proceed no further."
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.760]   In other words, okay, I'm gonna shut my mouth, right?
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.920]   Clearly, you're angry.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.080]   Clearly, I did something wrong.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.040]   I'm gonna shut my mouth, I'm gonna let you speak.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.380]   Then Job answered the Lord and said,
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.480]   "I know what you can do, all things."
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.960]   So I want you to pay attention to this,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.960]   because after what he says, God shows up
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.120]   and he basically reveals himself.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.760]   He says, "This is who I am, who are you?"
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.200]   And there's two, three chapters of this.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.000]   This is who I am, who are you?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.520]   Who are you to question God?
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.840]   Do you know who I am?
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.600]   Do you understand how this universe works?
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.520]   Do you understand the ways of the animals
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.880]   and the universe and the creation?
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.840]   And he just piles it on and on and on and on.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.040]   And Job, in the presence of the glory of God,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.280]   responds to him in this way,
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.980]   and I believe that this is the key to the book of Job.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.840]   Job answered the Lord and said,
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.640]   "I know that you can do all things,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.880]   "and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.020]   "Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.440]   "Therefore, I have uttered what I did not understand.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.920]   "Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.160]   "Hear, and I will speak.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   "I will question you, and you make it known to me."
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.320]   Instead of questioning you,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.440]   I'm going to ask you questions.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.920]   And there's a huge difference between the two.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.040]   One is a posture of humility.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.000]   I don't know, will you teach me?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.600]   Where questioning is, I believe you're wrong,
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.680]   so now I'm questioning you, and that's what he's saying.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.600]   I've been questioning you, but now I have some questions,
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.000]   and now I will listen to you.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.520]   He's humbled.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.800]   "I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.180]   "but now my eyes see you.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.640]   "Therefore, I despise myself,
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.260]   "and repent in dust and ashes."
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:02.880]   This is a man who experienced suffering like no other.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.720]   In our eyes, we look at it unjustly.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.100]   He was targeted because he was righteous,
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.780]   more righteous than other people in God's eyes.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.000]   But at the end of his life,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.600]   now after this, at the end, he said,
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.680]   "Oh, all these fortunes were restored and all this that."
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.920]   And we may look at that and say,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.060]   "Well, God caused him to suffer
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.100]   "so that he can give 10 children instead of five.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.960]   "Instead of 50 cattle, he got 100 cattle."
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.000]   Oh, that's what the suffering was about.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.400]   You know, that's what the health and wealth gospel
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.520]   people will tell you,
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.920]   but would you consider that a blessing?
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.560]   Right, I lost my wife, but I got two!
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.800]   (laughing)
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.320]   Is that the point of the Book of Job?
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.360]   The final point of the Book of Job.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.640]   This is the last thing that he says.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.400]   "Therefore, I despise myself and repent."
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.200]   What is he repenting of?
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.840]   What is he repenting of?
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.200]   Because the last thing he said prior to this was,
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.640]   "God is unjust because I am righteous.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.260]   "If I had done anything wrong,
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.200]   "yes, I would have deserved all of this.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.040]   "But he is unjust, and everything you're saying is wrong."
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.640]   But when God shows up, he realized,
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.500]   "I had no idea who you were.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.840]   "I've only heard of you, now I have seen you.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.680]   "I despise myself."
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.040]   And he repents.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.320]   He repents.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.320]   At the end of his suffering,
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.680]   the hideous thing that he went through,
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.240]   and there's no apology from God, there's no explanation.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.280]   Job's the one who repents.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.720]   You have to ask, when we study the Old Testament,
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.440]   you have to ask this big question.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.280]   You have to ask this every time you read the Old Testament.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.600]   How does this fit into the redemptive history?
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.520]   It's not like, the Bible is not like
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.680]   the chicken soup for the soul.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.680]   Where every chapter has its purpose.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.060]   You can go to chapter 20 or chapter three or whatever.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.520]   They all each individually have a purpose.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.000]   But all 66 books have a theme.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.120]   It is redemptive history.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:11.120]   God, in his sovereignty, is pursuing sinners.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.360]   So what purpose does Job have in this redemptive history?
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.840]   Is it just, if you suffer, God will be with you?
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.240]   Is that the point of the book of Job?
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.280]   How does that fit into redemptive history?
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:26.840]   If you read the book of Job carefully,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.320]   I think you will agree with me that in the end,
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.440]   and if you see the way that it concludes
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.960]   and what God says and what Job says,
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.100]   God doesn't show up and say, "Oh, you suffered.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:37.940]   "I'm with you."
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.880]   No, he doesn't say that.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.320]   See, you have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   You don't realize who you are
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.360]   because you don't realize who I am.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.380]   And then he repents.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:55.520]   Even a man who is righteous above other men
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.680]   in the eyes of God is deserving
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.480]   of the most hideous punishment.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.600]   Everything that Job went through,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.260]   as hideous and as difficult as that may be,
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.800]   without the blood of Christ,
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.680]   he will deserve that a hundredfold.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.000]   And that is only a taste of what all people
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.120]   will experience in eternity in hell and damnation.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.200]   And what he experiences is only a taste
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.440]   of what a sinner deserves without the grace of God.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.960]   And so he repents.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.040]   And isn't that the point of everything
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.980]   that God has been doing in history?
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.600]   The rich young ruler comes and said,
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.880]   "How can I earn eternal life?"
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.360]   Jesus said, "You must obey all the commandments perfectly."
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.520]   And in his arrogance, he says, "I did it."
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.760]   No man obeyed the commandments perfectly.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.660]   But in his arrogance, he said, "I did it."
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.000]   Jesus, knowing he's a rich man,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.300]   knowing he could not do what he was about to ask him,
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.680]   he said, knowing he was rich,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   "Then sell all your possession and give it to the poor."
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.960]   He didn't say give a tenth.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.320]   He didn't say be generous.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.000]   He said, "No, if you want to be completely righteous,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.260]   let go of everything," knowing he couldn't do it.
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.560]   And so what was his response?
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.900]   Silence.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.160]   Silence.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.940]   For the first time in his life,
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.180]   he ran into something he could not boast about.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.140]   He could not do.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.960]   And that's why the disciples look at that and say,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.340]   "Well, if a righteous man like that,
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.280]   if he can't get into the kingdom,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.680]   what about tax collectors like us?
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.880]   What about fishermen who have foul mouths?
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.260]   What about us?"
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.700]   He said, "What man cannot do, God will do."
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.160]   What was his point?
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.760]   Is to bring him to silence.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.440]   To stop making excuses.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.280]   Recognize who you are.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.320]   Recognize the sin.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.200]   Recognize the sin in our lives
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.520]   that we may come towards the beginning point of salvation.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.400]   A beginning point of sanctification
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.920]   is being broken over our own sins.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.280]   And coming to God in desperation,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.280]   I can't make it without you.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.760]   Remember John chapter eight, five through nine?
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.560]   Here's these people who are so angry
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.120]   because Jesus is exposing their sins.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.840]   He said, "You Pharisees, even in your prayer,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.620]   you're a hypocrite because you're doing it
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.880]   for other people to see.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.920]   Even when you evangelize,
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.880]   you make the converts twice as much
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.040]   sons of the devil as you are."
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.960]   And he's exposing their sins, so they're angry.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.040]   They gotta get rid of this guy
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.640]   because he keeps pointing sin out.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.240]   They come to Jesus and they wanna trap him.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.960]   He says, "Law of Moses says to sown
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.040]   a woman who's caught in adultery."
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.200]   And obviously the reason why they did that
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.840]   is because it was a trap.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.680]   If he says to sow her,
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   then he's gonna be guilty in the Roman government
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.200]   and he's gonna be guilty of murder.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.760]   If he says, "Don't stone her,"
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.320]   then all of the Jews are gonna recognize
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.560]   this guy's a lawbreaker.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.400]   So they thought, "This is it.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   We have the perfect thing to put him in jail
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.840]   and get rid of him."
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.640]   You know what he says?
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.020]   He turns around and he says,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.760]   "Let him who is without sin among you
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.840]   be the first to throw a stone."
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:19.960]   And at once, they became silent,
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.200]   they turned away, and they walked away.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.520]   When Jesus turned that spotlight,
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.720]   turned it around, and he says,
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.200]   "Yes, she may be deserving of it,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.240]   but what about you?"
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.560]   When he exposed their sin, they became silent.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.000]   Until we recognize who we are before God.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.680]   The gospel is just knowledge.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.700]   It's just information.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.800]   It's just theory, theology that we throw around.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.040]   We repeat, recite to one another.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.760]   But until we are broken over our own sins,
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.800]   our sins, my sins,
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.080]   the things that we've been working so hard to cover up,
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.220]   that we've been excusing and saying,
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.680]   "Well, I'm doing all of this.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.920]   Of course, I'm not doing good here,
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.720]   but what about all of this?"
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.800]   And we've been silently, quietly, subtly
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.840]   justifying our sins before God.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.400]   And there's nothing that hinders our walk with God
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.920]   more than self-justification.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.480]   The only way that we can come before God
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.360]   is to recognize our sins
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.480]   and come before him as a broken sinner.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.520]   I need you.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.340]   It's me.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.920]   Ephesians 2, eight and nine, it says,
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.840]   and this is not of your own doing.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.600]   It is the gift of God, not as a result of works,
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.120]   so that no one may boast."
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.720]   Boasting and Christianity are oxymorons.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.520]   Pride in our walk with God is an oxymoron.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.160]   You and I, every single person here,
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.040]   are saved because the son of God
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.640]   chose to walk off his throne and die for us,
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.160]   because there was no other way.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.640]   And to be saved and to boast about our righteousness,
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.720]   boast about who we are, it is an oxymoron.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.080]   First Corinthians 1, 28, it says,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.320]   "God chose what is low and what is despised in the world,
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.480]   even things that are not,
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.200]   to bring to nothing things that are,
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   so that no human being might boast in the presence of God."
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.880]   He deliberately chose the foolish,
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.440]   the greatest of sinners, as Paul says.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.040]   He deliberately did that,
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.800]   because he knows that our natural inclination
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.440]   is to glorify ourselves.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.720]   Even in the context of building church,
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.080]   even in the context of missions,
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.080]   we have a tendency to say, "Look what I am doing.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.600]   Look what I have done."
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.360]   We have a tendency to glorify ourselves,
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.440]   even in the context of glorifying God.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.680]   That's why Paul says,
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.520]   "God deliberately put a thorn on his side
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.000]   to keep him humble, for when I am weak, he is strong."
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.280]   It is when I am weak that he is strong.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.800]   That is the beginning of our salvation.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.000]   It is the beginning of our sanctification.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.920]   You see, when David confessed his sin,
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.200]   I don't know if he was justifying,
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.040]   but he suppressed it,
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.840]   because who could challenge David for what he did?
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.840]   Finally, it's kind of like what I mentioned in the beginning,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.040]   he shows a videotape, and Nathan illustrates,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.680]   "Now here's this guy who took his sheep,
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.840]   and he said, 'How dare he?'"
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.560]   And then he says, "No, you're that man."
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.680]   And he's convicted.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.520]   But if you look at his confession,
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.240]   his confession goes far beyond just the act of what he did.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.080]   In Psalm 51, three to five, it says,
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.440]   "For I know my transgressions,
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.840]   and my sin is ever before me.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.760]   Against you and you only have I sinned,
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.480]   and I've done what is evil in your sight,
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.360]   so that you may be justified in your words,
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.720]   and blameless in your judgment."
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.040]   So in other words, you are the only one who is just.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.320]   And then he says, "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.760]   and in sin did my mother conceive me."
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.800]   Why bring your mother into it?
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.960]   I mean, leave your mom out of it.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.840]   You did it, right?
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.280]   Why, why, why?
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.360]   My mother's womb, like it was partially my mom's fault too.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.720]   You know?
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.560]   Why does he bring his mother into it?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.240]   Because David recognizes that his sin
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.320]   is more than just that act.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:31.800]   He doesn't sin, he's not a sinner because he sinned.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.640]   He sins because he's a sinner.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.680]   He recognized the corruption
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.800]   that is at the core of his heart,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.360]   that causes him, and that causes him to desire
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.400]   to do these things, that he is corrupt to the core.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.040]   So his repentance wasn't, "I shouldn't have done that."
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.720]   That's true.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.080]   He needed to repent of that.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.000]   But his repentance goes far deeper than that.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.600]   This is who I am.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.800]   That's the beginning of salvation.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.480]   That's the beginning of maturity.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.920]   Even in our righteousness, even in our hard work,
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.760]   and in our discipline, if it doesn't begin
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.440]   with our brokenness over our own sins,
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.840]   it tends to be for our own glorification.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.040]   That's why Paul's been laying this foundation
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.920]   for three chapters over and over again.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.120]   No, you are guilty, you are guilty with the law.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.520]   You are guilty without the law.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.120]   You are guilty by creation.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.560]   You are guilty by morality.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.200]   You are guilty by the law.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.920]   You are guilty in your heritage.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.120]   You are guilty from birth.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.400]   You are guilty, you are guilty, guilty.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.720]   So that you may stay quiet.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.680]   Because he's about to introduce to us
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.600]   the answer to all of this sin.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.400]   He's about to get to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.520]   But if this is gonna make any sense to you,
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:55.280]   you have to first be quiet and listen.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:02.240]   The irony of all of this is that in the previous passage
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.840]   that we looked at, he mentions,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.760]   no, none is righteous, no, not one.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.040]   No one understand, no one seeks God.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.320]   All have turned this way together.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.520]   They have become worthless.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.000]   No one does good, not even one.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.720]   And then verse 13 and 14, he says,
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   all of this corruption is expressed by our tongue.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.200]   Their throat is an open grave.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.360]   They use their tongues to deceive.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.520]   The venom of asthma is under their lips.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.400]   Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.600]   And so here's these sinners, like justifying,
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.200]   condemning others, slandering.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.840]   The sinners who really should be quiet and just listen.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.820]   And yet there's only one person,
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.240]   one person who's ever walked this earth
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.000]   who had the right to speak.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.520]   There's only one person who could have spoken
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.360]   and he could have easily justified himself.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.080]   One person, you know who I'm talking about.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.600]   There's only one man who lived a perfect life.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.920]   One man who could stand before the Father
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.200]   and say, I am innocent.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.280]   And yet in Isaiah 53, seven, it says,
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.280]   he was oppressed and he was afflicted,
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.300]   yet he opened not his mouth.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.560]   Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.720]   and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.880]   so he opened not his mouth.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:25.360]   Do you not see the irony of sins?
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:31.440]   The sinners who's trying so hard to justify, nullify,
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.760]   to minimize our sins and yet the one who is perfect
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.320]   and holy chooses to stay silent
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.300]   so that he may be led to the cross,
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.960]   so that he may speak on our behalf before the Father.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.560]   How can we not worship this God?
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.280]   How can this not change us?
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.240]   How can this not break us?
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.240]   All of this was a foundation
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.800]   upon which he is going to build
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.600]   of why we need Jesus.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.720]   But first and foremost, to bring us to the point
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   where every single person in this room,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.640]   whether you have been disciplined or undisciplined,
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.520]   whether you've been distracted or not distracted,
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.120]   wherever you are, all have sinned
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.880]   and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.160]   Every single one of us,
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.140]   that we come before his throne of grace,
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.360]   seeking mercy because we have a high priest
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.280]   who sympathizes with our weaknesses.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.320]   So we pray that again, as we continue to study,
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.360]   that our exposure to the word of God
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.740]   is not just simply adding more knowledge,
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.320]   that you and I would come to a deep conviction
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:46.160]   of who he is and who we are in the light of that.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.520]   Let's take a few minutes to pray
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.960]   as we seek the Lord together.
