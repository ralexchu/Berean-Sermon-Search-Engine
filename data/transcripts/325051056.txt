[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   You have no guarantee at 40 or at 50 you're going to be walking right with the
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.720]   Lord. I don't necessarily know that either. I mean, so how do we best prepare
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.980]   and ensure for success is what we're going to be talking about. You know, I have
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.320]   a couple friends, they actually dated each other. They were both committed to
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.680]   long-term missions. They're my classmates. The guy ended up going to seminary
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.560]   but he had a problem with alcohol so he ended up just dropping out, becoming a
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   bartender, opening up a couple restaurants, failing in them, teaching at
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.620]   a learning center and then opening up like an exercise place and then failing
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.680]   in that. He's still single. That girl that he dated also was at the same seminary.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.040]   They went, they both graduated from Berkeley with me and then they ended up
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.400]   going to the same seminary. She is currently a fugitive of the law. I kid
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.020]   you not, she's hiding out at Indiana. Far removed, both of them, from where they
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:12.720]   said they would be when we were all 20 years old. My roommate, who was also the
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:23.120]   praise leader at the time, he got into a rage and just driving somewhere with his
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.960]   girlfriend, got so mad at her he pulled the car over and physically like
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.840]   assaulted her. And now he's not really walking well in the Lord. He has a lot of
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.980]   money. He married well in terms of financially. So he's off and everyone
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.040]   that, whenever we have little class reunions, we think of like what happened
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.960]   to the fire that we saw. So the people that are sitting with you at your tables,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.240]   are they gonna be here 10 years from now faithfully walking with the Lord? I hope
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:05.640]   so. I expect so. But knowing my own heart, I get entangled so easy and I drift and
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.080]   I wander so quickly. And I'm realizing I'm not smarter than Satan. I don't know
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.840]   the Bible as well as Satan. I'm not as relentless as Satan. I'm not as resolved
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.440]   to keep myself alive as much as Satan is resolving to put me and everyone around
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.400]   me to death. So I need help. And I know that you guys do too, right? So today,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.520]   we're gonna be talking about a lot of spiritual warfare-related things. We're
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.840]   gonna look through a lot of Bible passages and we're gonna see, I mean a
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.160]   lot of the unobvious ones. The obvious ones that you guys clearly like already
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.880]   assume everyone struggles with, I'm not gonna spend that much time on. Is that
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.160]   okay? I'm gonna be focusing a lot more time on other stuff. And there's
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.800]   gonna be like—I have about 18 slides with a lot of text and information. So you
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.880]   don't need to copy everything down. We are gonna try to record this thing and
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.600]   I'm gonna give you the PDF version of the slides so you can see all the
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.400]   reference verses and everything and study it on your own time. But we are
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.920]   looking at Lard Minds and Lions. And can you turn this on? And some people were
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.760]   very confused about the title and like all the announcements kind of kept
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   getting confused. And I'm kind of glad, but hopefully it'll help you remember
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:44.040]   the Lard Minds acronym. Hold up real quick. If you have your—if you are—actually
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.520]   you actually don't need to turn in your Bibles, I have it texted. But if you have
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.480]   your Bibles, turn to 1 Peter chapter 2. Is this not connected in?
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:07.040]   And let me give you a little context of 1 Peter chapter 2, or 1 Peter in
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:15.440]   general. 1 Peter was written to an area of very diverse Gentile, mostly Gentile
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:24.080]   Christians in the Roman Empire. So this is very diverse. And this is one of the
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.400]   later letters written amongst all the letters. And there's a growth in
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   misunderstanding of and hatred toward Christians. Okay? So these Gentile
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.360]   Christians, imagine, they're all from all kinds of different cultures. And so they're
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.640]   bringing their cultures and values into the church, even though the gospel
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   message was the same. And they're living— some of them are rich, some of them are
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.500]   poor. And there's a growing just confusion of what Christianity is about.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.360]   And would you guys agree that even in today's society, there's a growing
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.800]   confusion in the church? Would you guys agree with that?
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.200]   So the people in the Holy Roman Empire, they thought that somebody
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.840]   caught wind that Christians were homosexuals because they practiced
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.920]   brotherly love. So people were confused at this new religion, these followers of
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.320]   the way, and they're thinking—some of them because they practiced homo—like
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.200]   Philadelphia, they were homosexual. Some people caught wind that at these
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.120]   meetings, when they got together, some people would eat of someone's flesh,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.400]   drink of someone's blood, and what would that end up making you think they are?
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.920]   Cannibals. They thought they were cannibals. And so there was this
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:02.280]   misunderstanding and growing confusion about what Christians did. And so
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.520]   Emperor Nero hated Christians. For some reason, he hated Christians, and he
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.000]   started severely persecuting them. He would throw them to lions. He would throw
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   them in the gladiator ring, and if you guys think of just kind of movie scenes,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.200]   you could picture Christians being the ones being torn to animals, or thrown to
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:30.960]   animals. Christians were also like put on these giant stakes, and they served as
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:39.800]   human, like, light poles. And he actually had a road that was lit with Christian
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.760]   corpses that were burning. Is it working? Okay. Hallelujah. See, their spiritual
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.200]   warfare has already begun. Okay? And so there's a lot of severe suffering and
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.400]   persecution. What happens when there's a lot of suffering and persecution in the
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:07.520]   church? Some people panic. Some people are thankful. Some people, like, fall away. So
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.680]   this is a very hostile environment into which Peter writes. Okay? So we're gonna
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.120]   read verses 9 through 12. I'll just read it for you. And so Peter talks to this
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.760]   mostly Gentile people. "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.240]   nation, a people for God's own possession, so that you may proclaim the
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.680]   excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.600]   For you once were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.640]   You had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. So, beloved, I urge
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.720]   you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.360]   the soul. Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.680]   which they slander you as evildoers, they may, because of your good deeds, as they
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.080]   observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation." So what he is saying here is
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.840]   you are God's wholly set-apart people, so don't give into the flesh. Because
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.200]   especially right now, the more you give into the flesh, the more you're gonna
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.720]   react to these sufferings and persecutions wrongly, and then you're
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.360]   gonna dishonor God. And then chapter 5, he talks about, "Therefore, humble
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you at the proper time,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.280]   casting all your anxiety on him." And their anxiety is like, imagine our church
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   is getting—we've come together, and all of a sudden, police run in and
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.000]   take away all the pastors and leaders. How would you guys feel about that? Please
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.040]   do not say happy. It'd be a traumatic experience. How about some
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.160]   of you get taken away? Let's say some of the married couples get taken away. Even
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.320]   some of the kids get taken away, because you would use kids as leverage. So
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.940]   all of this stuff is going on, and so he's saying, "Casting all your fears and
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:04.320]   anxieties on him, because he cares for you. And be of sober spirit. Be on the
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.280]   alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.840]   someone to devour." So guess what? The devil wants you dead. The devil wants
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:22.080]   the name of Christ to be dishonored, and he's relentless. He's hungry. So don't be—
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.120]   don't be that weak prey, okay? "Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.080]   experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.840]   the world. And after you've suffered for a little while, the God of all
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.320]   grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself perfect,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:48.120]   confirm, strengthen, and establish you." Now, landmines. If you knew—if you were in
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.560]   battle, and you knew that there was a field of mines, how would you guys
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:58.000]   proceed? You would do a little, like, a jig around it? No, you would be very
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.400]   careful where you stepped. You would try to see any lumps in the ground, because a
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:09.680]   landmine that is obviously a landmine is not going to do its job, okay? So landmines
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.720]   kill you immediately. And I believe that sin would have fewer takers if its
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.640]   consequences were felt immediately. So Genesis 3:4, the serpent says to the
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.400]   woman, "You surely will not die." When God told her, "Eat of the fruit and you will
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.680]   die." So the devil's been lying and up to no good from the beginning. So what he's
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.920]   telling you probably is, "Oh, you do that. You watch that. You engage in that. You buy
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:42.760]   that. It's not gonna harm you," is what he says. And next thing you know, you end up
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.000]   having drifted so far away. And that's what our church is like. We're on this theme of
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.680]   drifting, right? Sin would have fewer takers if its consequences were felt
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:58.520]   immediately. Imagine if you, like, as guys in the summer, sisters or, like, girls—
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.960]   sisters dress modestly—but girls are dressed a little bit, like, funky, and then
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.800]   you look and all of a sudden, like, you're in jail for, like, some kind of
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.200]   lewd act. Let's say, like, you feel hostility toward that brother or that
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   sister, and next thing you know, like, you're convicted as a murderer. Like,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.400]   because people don't go from A to Z overnight. It's a gradual drifting. So sin
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.760]   would have definitely—would have fewer takers if the consequences were felt
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.160]   immediately. But we're not dealing with spiritual landmines. What we're dealing
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:41.800]   with are lard mines. Repeat after me. Lard mines. And what are these? The
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:49.280]   definition I put up here. "Traps and temptations that the enemy sets to
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:55.600]   destroy your prayer life, rob you of your joy, and to kill you and everyone around
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.880]   you." So is this serious stuff? Yes, it is. "Traps and temptations that the enemy sets
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.000]   to destroy your prayer life, rob you of your joy, and try to kill you and
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   everyone around you." You probably know this feeling. When you commit a sin and
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.320]   you liked it, there is some shame, guilt, justification involved in your heart, but
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.940]   what's the first thing you stop doing? You don't pray. So think through all the
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:33.600]   stuff in your life that prevents you from prayer, and that's gonna be the
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:39.920]   stuff we're gonna be looking at today, okay? The first thing that lard mines
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.240]   will do is it'll take away any desire to meet God face to face. You're not gonna
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.520]   be like, "God, search me and know my heart," because you don't want Him to do that. So
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.160]   you're gonna not pray. But what is usually accompanied by a lack of prayer?
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.760]   You don't want to read what? You're not gonna want to read His Word,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.880]   because you don't want to hear that. And if you haven't prayed, and if you haven't
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.200]   read, but you're in a small group, what happens in a small group? You're gonna
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.840]   have to show faith, and so you're gonna have to share your prayer requests, so
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.920]   you're gonna make something up. And then next thing you know, you're gonna keep
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.640]   having to come to church, and then at some point you're gonna think, "Why do I
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.240]   keep going to church? I don't even feel God. Oh, Pastor Peters or Pastor Marx or
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.920]   whoever's, like, message was just, 'eh.'" All he does is preach judgment. I don't
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.560]   want to hear this anymore. And then there's a gradual drift. But the first step is
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.720]   whatever kills your desire to pray. And he does not want you to talk to God,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.840]   because the more you don't talk to God, everything else is a domino. So those are
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.800]   what lard mines are, and they kill you slowly. If I hated your guts—I love David
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:51.080]   Jung, so I'm gonna use him as an example. If I hated David, okay, is it better for
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:57.920]   me to, like, just chop off his head? Or is it better for me to infect him with a
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.400]   virus that he doesn't know that is in him, and then over the course of a month
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.960]   or so, he destroys everybody around him. All his co-workers, all his friends, even
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.640]   the perpetrators around him, everybody. They all just get wiped out. If I was
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.520]   Satan and I hated his soul, I would not try to kill him right away. What would I
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.960]   try to do? It's like, you know, you guys ever see those cockroach traps? The
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.720]   cockroach traps that just get the cockroach just stuck like this isn't
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.240]   really effective. So over time, they've developed cockroach traps that actually
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.840]   look like they're just eating the food, and what do they do? They go back into
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.160]   their nest, and next thing you know, they all die, right? That's Satan's strategy.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.040]   You are dying, and he doesn't want you to realize it until you've killed everyone
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.240]   around you. That's Satan's strategy. So, lard mines are very dangerous things.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.120]   They're not real. If you look at a dictionary, it's not gonna come up. This
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.500]   is just an acronym, but just think like that. As soon as that kills your desire
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.440]   to pray, that is not a good thing, okay? And so we're gonna be taking the time to
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.520]   look on this. And so these lard mines, they prey on what your flesh desires, and
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:15.000]   you instinctively believe to be good. Money, good or bad? Money, good or bad?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.280]   Thumbs up, thumbs down. Good? Yeah. Money is not evil, okay? The love of it is evil.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:34.040]   Sex, good or bad? Good. Friendship, good or bad? Good. I don't know. I mean, whatever is
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:40.720]   good, the enemy is gonna either try to corrupt or to twist and pervert, okay?
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.400]   That's what he's been doing from the very beginning, and we're in no different
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.920]   situation. So, I'm gonna use an illustration that hopefully you'll
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:16:00.800]   remember. Can you see what this is? Oopsie. Shoot. Give it away. So this is a dagger
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:10.000]   dipped in blood, okay? And in areas where Eskimos live, they traditionally -- you ever
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.800]   wonder how they got all of their furs? It doesn't look like they're particularly
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:20.440]   fast. They're usually stout, right? So the way Eskimos hunt their prey is by using
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.380]   what they call a blood popsicle. And what a blood popsicle is is -- why are you
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:33.500]   moving by yourself? Okay. A blood popsicle is a dagger dipped in blood and planted
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:41.240]   on the ground. So a wolf, let's say, will walk by, smell the blood, and then what's
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:49.320]   he gonna do? He's gonna lick it. Tastes good. But the more he licks it, the more
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:56.160]   warm it is, the more bloody it becomes, the more it tastes good. So after about
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.320]   two or three hours, and then he'll try to bite it. And then gnaw on it a little bit.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.280]   And then like -- some of you guys who are visual learners are like, "Ah!" They lick this
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:14.440]   blood popsicle until their tongue is shredded. Because in the cold, it's numb.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.120]   What happens if that wolf is doing this for two, three hours? It
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:27.920]   bleeds to death. And then the fat Eskimo comes, takes it on the shoulders.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.320]   And sometimes, even if it's not dead, guess what it is? Stop moving by yourself.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:40.160]   It's -- I think I copied and pasted this picture, so -- but what happens? They're --
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:48.040]   they don't have blood, so they're weak. This is the enemy strategy for you. So
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.880]   the Eskimo just kind of finishing blow. And the wolf, what's it gonna do?
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:18:04.440]   They'll be like -- they're powerless. Satan wants to do this to you by baiting you,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.720]   not with stuff you don't like. Satan never tempts me with alcohol. Do you know
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:20.520]   why? I don't really like alcohol. Okay? Zero desire for it. That is not my
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.120]   weakness. I've got plenty others. I'm gonna share some while we talk about
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:32.240]   this. But for you, your instinctive pleasures look very different from mine.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.840]   And do you think the enemy who wants you dead doesn't know what your Achilles
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:44.560]   heel is? Yes, he does. Right? So that's how he wants to kill you. So the first thing
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.000]   that we're gonna look at is El Lus. And I'm not gonna spend too much time with
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.720]   it because you guys already mentally know where we're gonna go with this. Okay?
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.680]   You're gonna remember your body is a holy temple. You're
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.360]   gonna know all of these verses because you guys have already thought through
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.840]   them. But, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.740]   flesh to lust which wage war against your soul." I'm gonna stop there. "What are
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:16.280]   lusts? Whatever things your flesh craves which you know are in direct opposition
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.260]   to God." And these are not just limited to sexual sins. Now, all of these lard
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:26.100]   minds, there is some overlap. Okay? So you will see how one thing leads to another.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:33.840]   But so, for example, purity and dating engagement. Sometimes when you are in a
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.840]   dating relationship, this gets elevated. If you're already struggling with purity
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:44.200]   and you start dating, there is a struggle.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:50.240]   You know, at my wedding, so my wife and I met in '99 and then we started dating in
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.040]   2004. We got married in 2007. The very first kiss we ever shared was on our
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   wedding day. And I actually, like, I went in for the kiss and then she backed away
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:05.520]   and everyone just laughed at me. But anyway, so it was very awkward. But that
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.760]   was our very first kiss. And Pastor Peter actually shared that. And everyone's like,
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:15.040]   "Wow!" And then my non-Christian guests who had come, they're like, "So our pastor is
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.920]   supposed to not have any, like, hormones or, like, lusts, right?" I'm like, "Nah, dude." But the
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.800]   reason I told Becky, like, "The first kiss is gonna be on our wedding day because I
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.560]   don't trust me. And I've made too many mistakes in college. I do not trust me."
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.520]   And one of the benefits was, the girl that brought me to Berean, we dated, but I
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.680]   kept that same line and we remained friends because there were no lines
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:46.200]   crossed. So in dating, you have to be careful because if you engage in
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:54.560]   physical, any kind of physical affection that is not healthy, you're not gonna
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.040]   want to pray. You're not gonna want to share. Okay, so that's something you have
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.080]   to be careful of. Sisters, my encouragement is, just generally, this is
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.720]   not in terms of dating, please dress modestly. Okay, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 8,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.920]   "I will never eat meat again!" if that's humble somebody. You know, girl, sometimes I
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.320]   hear this, like, "Well, do you want me to dress like Laura Ingalls Wilder on Little
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:22.600]   House on the Prairie?" No. But dress where everything is covered and you're not
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:30.580]   stumbling anybody. And guys would appreciate that very much. Don't arouse
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.720]   lust in other people. Guys, same thing. Appropriate interactions with sisters.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.800]   The way they wrestle with lust, there's some similarity, but there are many
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.960]   differences. Do not interact with them in a way that causes their heart to kind of
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:51.920]   long to know you better, unless your intentions are clear. Song of Solomon
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   says it three times, "Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires." So those
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.560]   are things my encouragement, and this is the only thing I'm gonna spend—this is
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.920]   the only time I'm gonna spend on this issue, because you've probably already
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.280]   studied this. Some of you guys share about this regularly with people. Do not—
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   do not—just be careful with this one, because this is gonna mess you up. Okay?
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:23.560]   Next, A is your affiliations. I'm gonna read 1 Corinthians 15, 33 to 34.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.080]   Like I mentioned to you, all of these things are gonna be put on the Facebook
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.600]   page, the slides, so just write down what you feel like will help your discussion.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:38.960]   It says, "Do not be deceived. Bad company corrupts good morals. Become sober-minded
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   as you ought and stop sinning. For some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.720]   your shame." So what are affiliations? Friendships and relationships that
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:58.760]   taint, distract, or divide. Every person that you have in your life has been
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:05.080]   ordained by God, for whatever the reason. And whatever that person is, is he's
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:12.000]   either part of the harvest field, part of the missions field, your missions endeavor,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:21.840]   or someone who's gonna sharpen you in your walk. Any other relationship is gonna
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:29.040]   make you distracted. Any friendship or relationship has to be either this
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.320]   person is a soul I want to come into the light—that's my mission field, that's my
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:41.960]   harvest—or that person is someone who's gonna sharpen you in your faith.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:49.920]   Those are the two only real affiliations you guys should have in your hearts.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.440]   Because friends that you just hang out with may end up killing you. I mean, not
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.720]   literally, hopefully not. Right? They're gonna make you stray, and they may be in
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:09.560]   the church. Again, either they are your harvest mission field, or they are your
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:17.360]   co-laborer in Christ. If you define them any other way, that's gonna bite you in
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.280]   the butt. It's gonna numb you, and that's a lick that you're gonna take, and then
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.160]   you're gonna bleed out. Be careful with the affiliations you should make. So first
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:33.800]   of all, Colossians 4 or 5 says, "Be wise how you interact with the outsiders,"
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:40.640]   non-Christians. So when you have non-Christian affiliations, you need to
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.800]   make sure all of your conversation is seasoned with salt, that no unwholesome
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:51.240]   talk comes out of your mouths, that you are expecting this person to have, like,
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:58.880]   like, be bound in sin. So your interaction with that person has to be, "How do I
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:07.600]   share the love of Christ with that non-Christian person?" Now sometimes it
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.960]   takes time to build trust, right? That's why I'm actually against getting a new
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.320]   job and cold turkey sharing the gospel on your floor to all the new co-workers.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.960]   You know why? That's not necessarily unbiblical. That's kind of stupid, because
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:25.600]   then basically everyone has labeled you from day one, "Oh, you're the overly
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.960]   zealous." You could tell them you're a Christian, you go to church, but don't
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:34.020]   start just, "Bababababababababababababababababababa! No, no no no, no, no, no!" Right? 'Cause you're gonna be labeled. Be
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:39.760]   wise as you interact with nonbelievers. I actually say, "Think twice before you
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.100]   share the gospel." I don't ever say, "Don't share the gospel." I say, "Think
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.380]   about how you're gonna share it so it's effective. Christian affiliations that are
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.220]   either distracting or divisive. Some of you guys are very close and very good
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.800]   friends with each other. Yes or no? Some of you are like, "No I don't have any friends here."
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:02.400]   No, you guys are getting closer. And the closer you become, what happens? You enjoy
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.600]   just hanging out. My best fellowship happens with church people. My most
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.440]   favorite hangouts and my laughter is loudest with church people. And that's
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:21.600]   fine. But if your relationships start to be all about just hanging out, you're
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:28.320]   gonna all go down. And some friendships that are even in this room, I will say
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.120]   right now, you guys have to be careful not to just hang out. Because the more
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.520]   you hang out, you get addicted to hanging out and you stop hanging out with
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.480]   non-Christians that you're supposed to try to win to Christ. Right? Whenever you
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.080]   have free time, you're not thinking about that non-Christian that you should maybe
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.120]   like just pursue. You're thinking, "I wonder what so-and-so is doing. Hey, you
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.600]   want to watch Captain Marvel? You want to go eat BCG? Hey, Diamond Jamboree." And then
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.760]   most of your waking hours become just hanging out. And that's where young
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:03.080]   adults start to fall. Because you don't like work. Because everyone around your
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:08.600]   work is stinky. They cuss. They make crude jokes. Their like values are
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.080]   different. So I'm like, "Ugh, I have to endure." And then you go to your friends,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.560]   "Oh, I could be myself." But there is no Christ in either. You have to be careful
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:23.680]   with that. And who are our influencers? Who has a hold of your heart? Good and/or
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:34.720]   bad. Be discerning. Proverbs will say, "Bad company" or the like the associate--I
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.560]   forgot the proverb--but if you walk with the wise, you will go rise. Right? But a
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.200]   friend of a fool, something. Usually something to do with
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:49.720]   disruption. Right? Okay? Who you interact with, you have to be careful. Are you
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:57.440]   guys following this? Satan will let you sometimes just enjoy each other's random
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.520]   hanging out, and he will even let you maybe call it fellowship and leave it be.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.480]   Because he knows where that's gonna go. Okay? So be very discerning. Either a
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:15.400]   relationship is a pursuit for the soul or an iron sharpener. But if that
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.800]   relationship is anything else, you can drift because of that friendship.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:29.960]   Not sure if this makes sense. Okay? Third, "R," religion. Here's Ephesians 2, 8 to 10.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.720]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   a gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast." You guys have
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.400]   memorized this probably as a kid. "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.680]   Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, so that we will walk in them."
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.440]   So I love verse 10 because sometimes my people that I know who are all about
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.120]   like cheap grace, "Oh, it's been by--we're saved by grace and faith alone." I'm like, "Yeah, but
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.880]   for what purpose?" Verse 10 says, "Good works." But some people will skip verse 8
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.120]   and 9 and they will focus on verse 10. I have to do good. Okay? So how does
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:15.520]   religion mess me up? First, what it is is religious activity or response rooted in
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:26.800]   a desire to appease God or to please man. Religious activity or response rooted in
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:34.120]   a desire to appease God or to please man. It sucks sometimes to be a pastor because
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:40.800]   my job is religion. Okay? It's very difficult. So pray for us. Because it's
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.960]   not always easy having a wholehearted devotion to the Lord, because--and
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.600]   even if you don't, you have to put up that face. And sometimes that's
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:54.240]   very difficult. It's a struggle. But religious activity or response rooted in
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.640]   a desire to appease God--and what does it mean to appease God? To pay him back for
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.520]   something. Or he's judging me. He's about to be like--he's about to just
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:09.200]   ruin my business. I'm about to get laid off. So you're trying to stop his wrath.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:15.080]   Or you're trying to impress people. Outward religion to impress those in the
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.920]   church. The Pharisees were experts at this. So I'm not saying don't serve the
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.860]   church. But some of you guys, if your identity is rooted in, "I want to be
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.880]   known as that guy who serves all the time at church," you're in dangerous ground.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:38.720]   "I want to be the girl who's known as a prayer warrior, so I will pray so that
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:45.240]   everyone will know that I pray." Pretense and lack of confession for fear of
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:52.800]   judgment. When we sin, we're terrified to share because we're afraid of being
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:58.640]   judged. So over time we start developing a habit of using Christianese and
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:05.560]   sharing. Like I remember just thinking--I was sitting in a small group once. I'm
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:11.040]   like, "It is so clear to me right now that none of you guys are praying. Because if
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.120]   you were really praying, all of these prayer requests would not even come up."
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.080]   What is prayer? Is it a wish list? "Help me to have good health. Help me to have a
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.400]   good job. Help me to do this." No, it's not. Prayer is, "I am weak. I need
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.040]   intercession. I need someone to come and lift up my arm so I could pray." But what
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.480]   happens is, if we're not walking well with Christ but we feel the need to make
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.040]   sure that we're not church-disciplined, or like the pastors call you and go, "Hey,
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.120]   let's meet up." You're like, "Why?" Right? Sometimes you guys feel that way when we
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.960]   text you. I texted someone this morning. Minsoo Kim. You know who he is? He has
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.640]   three sons. I was like, "Dude, Minsoo, like I dreamt about you last night." I mean, that
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.320]   sounds so weird. But you were--I don't remember what it was, but his
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.240]   face came into my mind. So this morning I just texted him. I was like, "It's been a
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.600]   while. I haven't actually--we haven't sat down for a conversation since we came
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.840]   back from Korea. Let's get together." He said, "Oh, okay. Is it something that you need
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.920]   to talk about?" I was like, "No, no, no, no. I just want to hang out." So I had to tell him about my
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.900]   dream. And he was like, "Dude, you're weird." I'm like, "Thank you." So we're meeting up, okay?
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:21.120]   But if you are not walking well, you're afraid to talk to a small group leader,
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.980]   you're afraid to talk to a praise leader, you're afraid to talk to a spiritual
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.560]   leader. True or false? Why? You feel like you're gonna--
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.800]   they're gonna be judged. And our pastors are not that
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:39.320]   judgmental. We're pretty gracious dudes, okay? But you in your heart feel like, "I
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:46.400]   have to make sure I'm in the positive with pastor. Because if I'm not, like,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.160]   they're gonna talk about me, they're gonna be worried about me, they're gonna
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:55.920]   come after me." That's there, okay? James 3 and 5 says, "Confess your sins to
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:03.000]   each other." Because we all stumble in many ways. But religion is, "I will do the
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:12.440]   church stuff so that I don't have people on my case." Or the "just enough" mentality,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:19.560]   "I will do just enough where people don't call me out." And for the rest of your
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:29.640]   life, you're in spiritual mediocrity and God hates that. You guys follow me? This
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.760]   is a very dangerous thing. This is why I wanted to spend time on these large
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.080]   minds because large minds don't--you're not--it's not decapitating you, it's
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.880]   killing you slowly. Have you met people who've done church for a long time and
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.920]   they've drifted, they've fallen away, now they're like, "I hate church." You know how
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.480]   hard it is to come back after you leave the church for a while? Because you're
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.760]   like, "Oh, I've been there, I've done that. Yeah, I've prayed. I've cried my tears at
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:01.080]   retreat. I've done all that. Yeah, I'm beyond saving or reconciling." And that's
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.360]   the hardest person to win over because they've given it a try and it hasn't
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.000]   worked. But what they've given it a try is churchianity. They didn't give
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Christ a chance, they give religion a chance, churchianity a chance. And you
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:22.400]   know people like this. What's L? Lutz. And even for your small groups, discuss it
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.440]   if it is something that's killing you. But try to do the other ones. Spend more
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:33.200]   time on the other subtle ones, okay? What's A? Affiliations. Are all my friends,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:40.880]   brothers, and sisters in Christ? Or my mission field? Or are they just my
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:47.080]   buddies? Okay, dangerous stuff. Religion is a third one. Fourth one, the D. Are my
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:53.520]   duties. Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.600]   bring peace but a sword. For I came to set a man against his father and a
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.120]   debtor against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.960]   and a man's enemies will be the members of his household. He who loves father or
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.800]   mother more than me is not worthy of me, and he who loves son or daughter more
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.640]   than me is not worthy of me, and he who does not take his cross and follow after
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.240]   me is not worthy of me. He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.440]   lost his life for my sake will find it. If this was the only Bible passage that
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:25.000]   you had available to you, God would sound like a selfish jerk. But this is one of
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.360]   the only few passages where he actually talks about how he is above your family.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:35.320]   For the most part, God wants you to have a good family, yes or no? Is that a
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:41.600]   qualification even for any service in the church visible, yes or no? Yeah. And if
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:48.680]   I'm honest, I'm most real with my wife. So sometimes I don't want you to ask my
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:55.600]   wife how I am at home because that's gonna taint your image of me. But if she's
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   very happy with me, I'm gonna be like, "Go ask her. Go ask her." And I've like washed
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.320]   the dishes, I've taken out the trash, I played with the kids, I put them down.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:08.800]   Even before she asked me, "Go ask her." Right? But I am the most real with my
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:15.680]   family. And as my kids get older, they're either gonna be—they're gonna have to
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:23.240]   love God. They're either gonna love the Lord more through my faith or despite my
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:30.000]   faith. How I treat them is either gonna hinder their walk with God, or that's
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.400]   something they have to overcome, or it's gonna bless them. Family knows you best.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.240]   So this is not a passage that's speaking against having good family
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.240]   relationships. Some of you guys who are church rats, you need to be more at home.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:48.680]   Right? So there are times where I've actually told some people, "Don't serve in
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.480]   this way. You're doing too much. Spend your Saturday at home with your family
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:58.320]   who's not a Christian." Okay? And so do you guys see how these are all kind of
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.240]   interconnected with the religion and all this stuff? Yeah. So duties. So what they
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:09.200]   are are responsibilities that either become idols or smoke screens.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.800]   Responsibilities that either become—or actually grammatically should be "become
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:25.920]   either"—become either idols or smoke screens. In the OC, family-first mentality
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:31.320]   is actually a very dangerous thing. And there are families at our church that I
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:37.800]   feel like are very close to, if not already idolizing their family. Happy
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.520]   wife, happy life mentality, I ask you never to say "happy wife, happy
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:49.280]   life," especially after you get married. That is actually worldly wisdom that I
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:38:05.120]   understand. Okay? It's "worshipful couple, happy life." Doesn't rhyme. Okay? If you
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.000]   get the happy wife, happy life mentality in your head as a girl, you're gonna
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.080]   slowly think that your husband exists to please you. And if you're a man,
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:22.360]   you're gonna slowly start to think that whatever my wife wants comes
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:27.640]   first, because God said, "Love your wives as yourselves." You have to be very careful.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:32.320]   It can even be in the form of irresponsibility. Okay? And that's another
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:38.240]   one, like, shirking your duties. 1 Timothy 5:8 says if a believer is not
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.720]   concerned about his own relatives—this is about widows, okay? They're like, "Before
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.640]   you put them on the list of widows supported by the church, make sure that
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.400]   they have believing families. Check to see if they have believing family
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.600]   members or not, because those believing families should actually take care of
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:57.200]   those widows before the church does." Okay? So that's an—and if a believer, or if a
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.520]   man does not take care of his own family, he is worse than an unbeliever. That's
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:04.200]   what he says, because even unbelievers take care of their own. Or jobs have
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:11.600]   become more than jobs. That's another duty. Okay? What is your job? I mean, I'm
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:18.480]   not like, teacher. No, I'm not talking about that. Your job is your tent-making
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:27.080]   industry that helps you to eat. True or false? Is your job your identity? No.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.760]   Especially some of you guys who are at an age where you want to be defined by
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.560]   your career. Your job is not your identity. Your identity has to solely be
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:41.160]   on the cross of Christ. But some of you, especially those of you who are more
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:49.560]   successful or are smart, jobs can become more than just a job. And we're gonna
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:56.160]   talk about this, but you're gonna think that the opposite of poor is rich. The
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:03.400]   opposite of failure is success. It's actually not. It's freedom. The opposite
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   of poor is freedom to serve, to give. The opposite of failure is freedom, right?
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:18.120]   Success is not like having a PhD or this and that. So when your job becomes more
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:24.080]   than your job, be very careful because that's gonna be your pitfall. But you
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.480]   will never say, "I think I'm idolizing my job." No, you're saying, "I'm gonna, yeah, I'm
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.040]   gonna try to pursue my career so that I have a bigger platform to give God more
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:40.080]   glory." It never works that way. Usually you bear fruit when you're faithful. You
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:48.280]   don't ever plan to bear fruit. Does that make sense to you? What I've seen on
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.680]   the missions field in different countries and many churches is you bear
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.160]   fruit because you're faithful. You don't bear fruit because you strategize. Some
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:02.200]   of the most fruit-killing people are people in churches who have PhDs. When I
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.440]   was in Korea doing my job, I hated taking profs abroad to see the poor because
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.200]   they're always trying to teach. They always think they know more. I'm like, "You
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:18.000]   are such a hindrance to our group right now."
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.680]   Success, don't mistake that with duty, okay? Especially for you guys who have
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.720]   Asian backgrounds, this is a little bit tough. Your priority has to be God and
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:35.920]   then family. But don't use your family as a god. So your responsibilities are
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.080]   either become idols or things you hide behind. A lot of young couples, after they
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.600]   have kids, they hide behind their kids' nap times. They hide behind their kids.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.440]   And it's hard. I will tell you, it's really hard to be a parent and to be a
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.920]   good one and to manage everything. But sometimes as a parent, you can hide
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.800]   behind the kids. And that's a very—and so I would encourage you guys, if you have
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.000]   really close friends who are parents of toddlers, that's a very difficult stage.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.520]   Pray with them. Sometimes be like, "I will sit in the cry room with your kids so you
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:11.360]   can come in to worship," if they're like one-year-old. That's really difficult. And
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.640]   then what happens, you start developing a pattern of—you know what, I'm gonna put
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.160]   my wife a little bit on the spot. So in Korea, we would go to a new church and
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.760]   she would not want to talk to anybody. So you know what she would do if she
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.800]   doesn't want to talk to anybody? Just grab one of our kids and be like, "Ahh."
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.120]   I'm like, "What are you doing? You're feeding him a cracker. He doesn't want to
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:35.360]   eat that." She's like, "Be quiet. You don't know." I'm like, "All right." You can either hide
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:44.600]   behind or idolize something that is good, a duty. Okay, next thing, materialism.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.960]   1 John 2:15-19. "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.840]   the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.760]   lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life." Okay, they're all
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.400]   interconnected. "Is not from the Father, but is from the world. The world is
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.000]   passing away, and also its lusts, but the one who does the
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.080]   will of God lives forever. Children, it is the last hour. And just as you heard that
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.440]   the Antichrist is coming, even now many Antichrists have appeared. From this we
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.480]   know that it is the last hour. They went out from us, but they were not really of
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.920]   us. For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But they
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.280]   went out, so that it would be shown that they all are not of us."
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.120]   Why are these things together? If you actually look at your Bible, they're
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:35.760]   separated. But there's a logical flow. Materialism often leads to apostasy, if
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:43.440]   not at all, all times. Would you guys agree? The more materialistic you get, the
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.480]   less important your faith becomes, because you stop hoping in heaven, you
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.720]   start hoping more on earth. And that's how people drift out.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.560]   Verse 18 is all about Antichrist and apostates. So the more materialistic and
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.120]   the worldly that your heart becomes—and I won't be able to tell if I'm looking at
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:06.320]   you, unless you're wearing something really fancy, okay? But it's gonna cause
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:14.840]   you to drift. So it's a worshipful desire for riches we hope will enable us to
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:23.360]   have greater pleasures, stability, and comfort. And where does that stem from?
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:28.560]   Ungrateful hearts. We feel that God—we deserve more than God has already
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:37.000]   given us. So ungrateful hearts is the stem and the root. You guys know the
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.240]   parable of the four soils? We looked at this at the retreat. The third soil—the
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.960]   second one was where it was persecution, right? What's the third one? The worries of
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:52.760]   this life—desire for riches and pleasures. They come and choke the word,
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:45:02.160]   and so it bears no fruit. Worries of this life, riches, pleasures choke the fruit.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:13.680]   And that is not a Christian. So be careful that you are not being choked
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:19.120]   and proved to be an apostate. And remember, the opposite of poor is not
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.480]   rich. It is enough. Some people are, "Where do you get that in the Bible?" I'm like, "Alright,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:29.160]   I'll show you, okay?" I look for it—I mean, Luke 3, where the people are repenting. The
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.640]   tax collector comes and repents. He's like, "John the Baptist, what do I do?" He says,
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:38.200]   "Give to the one who has need." The guy who has the tunic. "What do I do? What do I do?"
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.560]   If you have two of them, give one of them to that guy. So he doesn't say give both
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:51.120]   away. You have one, you have one. It's to have enough. 1 Timothy 6, 8 says, "Godliness
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.880]   with contentment is great gain." Verse 10, "The love of money is a root of all kinds
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.960]   of evil, and many have fallen into that trap." Verse 17, it says, "Command those who
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.600]   are rich in the present age not to be arrogant." Because people who are rich,
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.100]   what do they have a tendency to think? They deserved it. They worked hard for
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.560]   riches. They got it because they're better people. That's what gets
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.760]   into their mind. So, "Command those who are rich in the present age not to be
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:27.480]   conceited, nor to put their hope in God, or no, sorry,
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:33.640]   nor to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God who
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.920]   gives everything for us for our enjoyment." So if you guys are struggling
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.000]   with like, "Well, does that mean I can't watch a movie? I can't go on a vacation?"
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   No! 1 Timothy 6, 17, if you guys memorize it, first, if you have money, don't think
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.640]   that you deserved it. Two, don't put your hope in it. Three, enjoy it. But verse 18
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.960]   talks about, "Be generous and be willing to share." Some of you guys are rich. You
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:07.320]   might not think it, but last week for our James study, if you make, how much are you
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:13.040]   top 1% in the world? 40,000. If you make $40,000 per person for your
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:18.240]   family, you are top 1% in the world. You are ridiculously rich. Enjoy it, but give
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:23.300]   it away. Whatever you don't have it. So the opposite of poor is enough. Everything
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.800]   that God has given you that is outside of enough, you're called to use it for
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:32.200]   ministry. That's why your affiliations are important. Okay? Everything outside of
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.900]   is enough is supposed to be used for ministry, to win these souls to Christ, to
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.800]   feed the poor, because that's true religion. It's not supposed to be for you
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:49.720]   to enjoy beyond what you can enjoy. All the stuff that you've been given,
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.920]   everything beyond enough is for the purpose of ministry and building up the
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:01.380]   body of Christ, building up his church. Orange County will tell you all of the
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:09.420]   stuff that you get is so that you can enjoy ages 65 to 100. Probably not 100 yet,
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:18.600]   90. Retirement? I hope none of you guys retire. I mean, you're like, "What?" No, no.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:24.800]   What I'm saying is that you're active at 65 just as much as you are now in
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:32.000]   ministry. It'll look different. But with whatever you've been given, retire. My
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.240]   hope for retirement is just that I'll have just enough where I'm not a burden
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:45.080]   that I could still minister. So I'll preach till I die. Opposite of poor is not rich.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.920]   It's enough. And this isn't something that you guys who may be struggling with,
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:54.280]   because remember, affiliations, duties, responsibilities, all of this stuff is
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:02.840]   interconnected. Aye, we're almost done. Image. Do not be afraid when a man becomes
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.880]   rich, when the glory of his house is increased. For when he dies, he will carry
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.600]   nothing away. His glory will not descend after him, and though while he lives he
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.000]   congratulates himself, and though men praise you when you do well for yourself,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.600]   he shall go to the generation of his fathers. They will never see the light.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.960]   Man in his pomp, yet without understanding, is like the beasts that
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:30.040]   perish. For some reason, Orange County, we worry, especially in the Asian culture, a
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.960]   lot about your image, what people perceive of you. So it is a desire to be
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:44.560]   worshipped. They say before marriage, guys work out really hard to be like--to impress
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:51.040]   the girls. After marriage, guys work out really hard to impress other dudes.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.320]   Yeah, look at my chest, right there. Right? Because then you can't impress girls
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:02.360]   anymore. I'm trying to work out so I don't die. I've learned. So if you see me
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   at the gym, it's these lightweights. I'm like--I'm just trying not to die,
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.720]   basically. And I've gone every day to the gym this whole week, except yesterday,
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.800]   just trying not to die so I could be more effective with my time here, okay?
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:22.600]   But a lot of times when people work out, it's not for health, it's for aesthetics.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.040]   So they'll look better in there. You know, honestly, they make nicer clothes for
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:33.120]   skinny people. I hate shopping for clothes because it hurts my esteem. I'm
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:39.440]   like, man, and even if I don't breathe, it still sticks out, right? I'm like, this
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:46.840]   sucks. But why? For me, it's because maybe in my head I want to appear more machismo
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:51.800]   or more handsome. But for what end? You know, my wife's not gonna love me more or
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:59.840]   less. But we have that in us, a desire to be esteemed. Some of us want to be
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.000]   respected as a guy who knows his theology. Some people want to be
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.320]   respected for a guy who's really successful. Some want to be respected as
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.280]   the guy that all the girls are like, "Oh!" over, right? You have that. Girls, same thing.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:17.840]   Some of you want to be esteemed as the girl who's such a good servant.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:23.560]   Some girls are esteemed as always being the girl that everyone comes to
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:30.520]   for makeup tips and beauty suggestions and shopping. And you know, we all
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:36.080]   wrestle with our perception that we want to give off to other people. Remember, our
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:40.400]   identity is in Christ. We have died with Christ. We have been raised with Christ.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:51.500]   You're all just really cool spiritual corpses. Right? That's your image. But
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:56.040]   anything beyond that is folly because you're not gonna take that with you.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:04.200]   Satan's favorite sin was his desire to be worshipped, his image, our ambitions, our
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:12.880]   accolades, our accomplishments. Is your pursuit, your lust to be the best guy?
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:18.920]   I've long since stopped trying to be the best guy at something because -- so for
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.680]   example, I used to love volleyball and basketball because I used to jump high.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:29.040]   Now, I can't even touch the net. It sucks. So I don't play basketball anymore. And
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.560]   then in my head, I'm still like a 22-year-old, like, young spry guy. And then
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.160]   when I'm on the court, like, five minutes in, I strain a hamstring. It sucks. So I
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:45.800]   don't play anymore. I don't play sports. I hurt my pride. Okay? There is a desire in
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.600]   us to excel at whatever we do, not because we want to be useful to the Lord,
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.520]   but sometimes because we want to be known as that person. So ambitions,
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:53:03.000]   anything, accolades, accomplishments, are you in it for that? That's a lard mine. A
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:11.160]   religious image that you want people to know of you, right? I worship even angels.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.720]   I have the gift of tongues. You want to hear me pray? It's not so much at our
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.640]   church, but at charismatic circles, people who have the gift of tongues, they pray
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.520]   louder. I'm like, I have no idea what you're saying, and I can't even hear what
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.720]   I'm saying. Stop, right? Because in Korea, a lot of people pray charismatically
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:32.040]   because the more passionately they pray charismatically, they want to say, "I
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.080]   have a closer relationship with God than most all of y'all." And it's a religious
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:42.320]   image you want to portray. Same thing. Like, some guys are very good at
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:48.560]   pretending to be humble. Oh, no. That's all a fake show. I mean, not all, but what I'm
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:54.800]   saying is, if your desire is to be known as a person who is like this, it's a lard
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:05.440]   mine. Your identity is in Christ. Next, nuptials. N-words are hard. That's why the
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:10.800]   R--one of the N-words I changed to R. That R used to be, I think,
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:16.720]   relationships. What is it now? Huh? Yeah, it became religion, so I had to do a
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.680]   little bit like a mix-and-match. N-words are hard. That's why you have lard mines.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:25.240]   But it works. Okay, nuptials. "But this I say by the way of concession, not of
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:29.160]   command. Yet I wish that all men were even as I am. However, each man has his
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.840]   own gift from God. One in this manner, another in that. But I say to the
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:37.400]   unmarried and to the widows that it is good for them to remain them if they
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:43.120]   remain even as I." So an unhealthy obsession that sees you into thinking
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:48.640]   that marriage is the golden life and that you are incomplete without it. Some
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:53.520]   of you guys may, in your early 20s, not really think this is a big deal. But when
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:55:00.160]   guys hit 35-ish and girls hit 28-ish, and that's completely
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:05.400]   subjective, right? You feel like, "Oh, I gotta meet somebody. Oh, I
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:11.720]   gotta hurry up and settle down." And there are sisters who are tempted to
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:19.640]   just settle because they feel like, "I might miss out. If I don't
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:24.920]   start dating now, I'm gonna miss out." And that is a real struggle I know that
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:31.240]   exists at our church in a lot of our ladies and our guys as well. Guys, "Oh, I
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.200]   can't get married right now because I don't have enough of a stable job," or "I
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.040]   don't have enough this," or "I don't have enough that." That's your insecurity
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:42.160]   speaking. And insecurity is wounded pride. It is not humility. And yes, you do have
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:49.320]   to have a degree of visible responsibility, but don't make marriage
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:55.880]   ever the goal of your life. You know, one of the best words of advice Pastor Peter
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:04.400]   Ayer gave me when I was 24 was this, "Peter, for 50-plus years, you're gonna be
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:12.760]   married. So while you're single, just be useful." So he didn't mean it to say that
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.120]   I'm not gonna be useful as a married man, okay? There are clearly things that
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.680]   married men do better than single men just in terms of like their level of
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:27.520]   understanding. But marriage sometimes destroys people's faith, okay? So don't
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:32.240]   make marriage the goal of your life. So unhealthy obsession that deceives you
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:36.520]   into thinking that marriage is the goal and that you are incomplete without it.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.200]   And you know what happens to married couples after two, three years? What
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.080]   becomes the next "the goal"? Kids. So if they don't have kids, they're like, "Oh, I
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.280]   feel so incomplete." I'm glad we didn't have kids for eight years. I mean, we
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.760]   cried a lot, but I'm glad we didn't have kids for eight years because I wouldn't
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.160]   have learned and experienced the things I did. The only regret is now I'm kind of
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:00.560]   older, so if we wanted more kids, it's like it's less likely to happen because
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.720]   I'm gonna be six years old when I take them to high school. No, thank you very
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:11.600]   much, right? But kids is not the end goal. So marriage is good.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:19.280]   Singleness is just as good. Right now as a single, if you have a lot of money in
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:24.320]   your account, don't blow it all on your wedding. No, don't do it. Travel the world.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:29.880]   And I'm not talking resorts, okay? Some people love to travel to fancy schmancy
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.160]   places that all look the same, just depends on the food. The food is
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:37.440]   different. The ocean scenery is different. No, travel to see God's heart for the
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.800]   world. And you can't do that from a resort taking pictures of your feet with
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:53.600]   the ocean in the background, okay? Do short-term vision trips with some
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.640]   friends. You know what? Let's go visit and see what we can do about the poor and the
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:06.120]   widows in El Salvador. Hey, let's check out this trip to India. Because right now
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:13.120]   you don't have to ask permission on how you spend your money. Becky goes,
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.560]   "Wait, so you're gonna take people to Haiti? Who's paying for that?" I'm like, "We
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:26.060]   are." "Why?" I'm like, "Well, you end up having to have a discussion." But when you're
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:29.200]   single, you don't have to answer to anybody. And you don't have to take care
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:34.240]   of your kids' swimming lessons, gymnastics lessons. So while you can, money comes
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:39.800]   and goes. And while you are still by yourself, this is the most freedom you
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.960]   will ever have. This is the most, I mean, for you guys who are financially strapped,
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:48.640]   I'm just generally, okay? But your single young adult age is where you're gonna
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:54.560]   have the most time and money that you could spend however you want. Do it for
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:00.200]   the kingdom, don't do it for you. Because marriage is gonna happen, houses are
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.200]   gonna happen, life is gonna happen, but this period, this window of time, you
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:10.600]   might miss out if nuptials are your obsession. Maximize your freedom. And I'll
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.420]   tell you right now, if you're a malcontent as a single, you'll be a
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:18.360]   malcontent as a spouse. A malcontent basically means you're always kind of
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:24.160]   unhappy. You're a curmudgeon, okay? If you're an unhappy single, guess what's
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:28.120]   gonna happen when you get married? You're gonna take that unhappiness and affect
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:33.240]   your spouse. Work on being happy now. Yeah, this is not some prosperity gospel
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.960]   teaching. I'm just, like, practically speaking, be delighted in the Lord now. Be
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:43.080]   satisfied in the Lord now. And then be satisfied in the Lord more as a unit and
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:50.080]   as a family unit. It's different, it's not better, okay? We're almost done. E,
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:56.280]   entertainment. This is a description of godlessness in the last days. Treacherous,
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.440]   reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. We will not
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:09.640]   call it pleasure. A lot of us who work will call it rest. True or false? We will
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:18.960]   not call it indulging. We will call it, like, releasing pressure. We won't call it
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:29.840]   idolatry. We will call it, like, unwinding, alright? I know people who really
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.680]   wrestle with video games. I know people who really wrestle with Korean dramas,
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:39.080]   movies, and all of these things. And this is what Charles Spurgeon said a hundred
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:45.280]   plus years ago, but it's very, very apt. If our church members fall into the habit
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.520]   of frequenting the theater, we shall soon have them going much further in the
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:56.880]   direction of vice. And they will lose all relish for the ways of God. If theater
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.000]   going became general among professing Christians, it would be the death of
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.680]   piety. Yet one finds a taste for such things increasing on every hand. What is
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:17.320]   theater today? Is it Netflix? Before, you had to look like a gamer. If you're
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.920]   sitting in front of a TV playing games, you look like such a loser. If that's all
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.720]   you do. But now, I know married dudes who go to the bathroom so they can play
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.920]   their game away from their kids. And then they're like, how many times a day you
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:35.000]   gotta go poo, right? You gotta, like, you're in there for 45 minutes. It looks
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.240]   different and it's a lot more sneaky now because you can just do it on your own
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.440]   phone. You know, when I was wrestling with games, I hated games that you play this
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.880]   way. You know why? Games you play this way, what happens? You look like you're
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:53.200]   playing a game. But games that you play this way, I just look like I'm, uh, like
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.600]   writing an email, okay? And I sometimes pretend. So my Becky doesn't, like, get on
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:04.360]   my case. I've since deleted games from my phone because it kills me. And I try to
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.960]   limit what I watch. I try to limit, like, even going out to a movie with my wife.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.960]   I'd rather, I realize it's better to take my wife out for dinner and coffee than to
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:19.560]   a movie where we're both just like, right? We feel better about the evening if we
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.120]   just engage each other. And it's not to say the movies are bad. And you guys know
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:31.000]   where we're going with this. But though not sinful in and of itself, it is
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.040]   idleness masquerading as rest. That's entertainment. And some people get
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:46.680]   addicted to rest/idleness. Though not sinful in and of itself, entertainment is
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:52.840]   idleness, the filling of time that is masquerading as rest. The funny thing is, I
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:58.320]   know people who are addicted to shows, movies, and games. Does it help you rest
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:06.200]   more or less? You sleep less when you have a game on your phone or a movie on
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.840]   your phone. Internet -- some people's entertainment is actually reading
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:19.880]   through, like, blogs. You're less likely to sleep on time, true or false? Yeah.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:25.280]   Poor stewardship of time leads to poor stewardship of everything else. Agree or
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.640]   disagree? Yeah. Do you guys have more hours a day than me or less hours a day --
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:39.000]   a fewer hours a day than me? This is exactly the same. Okay? You have the
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.040]   same amount of time as everyone else. So what do you do with all the time that
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.440]   you can use freely? Do you engage your heart? Do you engage your spirit? Or do
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:55.240]   you indulge the flesh? And acting our age. And men, ladies, we need to grow up.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:02.080]   If you saw me playing with Legos right now and my kids weren't around, you would
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:07.400]   judge me. If you saw me playing with G.I. Joe action figures and my kids weren't
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:14.840]   around, you would judge me. Rightfully so. Do not be entertained by things you were
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:23.960]   entertained by at age 12, now at age 25. Grow up into him who is the head, grow up
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:31.200]   into maturity. Secularism, last one. You are the salt of the earth, but if the
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.280]   salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.920]   for anything except to be thrown out and trapped underfoot by men. You are the
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.760]   light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden, nor does anyone light
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.480]   a lamp and put it under a basket. But on the lampstand it gives light to all who
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.920]   are in the house. Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.120]   see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven. What this is is
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.800]   it's a call -- we are to live in the world and yet not think like those who live in
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:00.120]   the world. Living in the world and not thinking like those who live in the
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:07.000]   world. So how do you do your life? You lead it quietly and faithfully. Don't
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:15.120]   have ambition. Be careful. Chip on the shoulder, the world may say it's a good
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:23.480]   thing. Scripture will say that's folly. Life approach. 1 Thessalonians 4, 11, 12, in
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.360]   the NIV it says, "Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and to mind your own
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:32.760]   business and to work with your hands." It's kind of ironic. "Just be faithful" is
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:39.160]   your ambition, what Paul says to Thessalonica. Ministry approach. Though we
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.440]   walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.680]   of our warfare are not of the flesh. They are divinely powerful for the
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:52.440]   destruction of fortresses. So even when we plan church growth, we don't plan like
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:58.160]   the world. We don't use worldly marketing tactics to build a church. Sometimes the
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.600]   things that you feel like the leaders may be doing may make no sense and
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:09.080]   that's foolish or slow. We don't operate under worldly values of advertising,
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.800]   church growth. We don't work under those principles. We work
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:19.000]   under what Scripture prescribes for us.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.080]   That's why I think seeker-sensitive movement is so stupid. You don't see
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:31.040]   Jesus being seeker-sensitive. Like, "Just get them fed. Just get them to follow me,"
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:35.040]   he said to 20,000 in the crowd. No, he actually keeps running away from them.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:46.160]   They keep following him. And your life should not be defined by social causes,
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:53.440]   by your political affiliations, by emotional relativism. And what that is
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:59.360]   is like, even like things like mental health issues, depression, all that kind
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:05.720]   of stuff, your life needs to look different. That's why I feel so angry
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.560]   when I read about pastors who commit suicide. But what gets me even angrier is
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:15.040]   that the people who are like, "Even pastors struggle too." And for some reason that
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.880]   annoys me so much because that guy should never have been a pastor to begin
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:26.080]   with. Why did you put him there? Because he can give a good sermon? If I really
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.760]   struggle with clinical depression, please don't let me step on this pulpit. Because
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.960]   I need to sort some things out first. And if a pastor commits suicide, guess what?
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:42.240]   He enables everyone else to do. Even if a pastor who's a man of God can, like, it's
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:49.040]   okay, I guess. No. So emotional relativism. And this world is becoming more and more
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:55.640]   confused. You cannot think like the world. LGBTQ issues. Scripture is very clear.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   So there are things that are in the world that are influencing the church in terms
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:13.320]   of causes. Women are precious, absolutely unequal with man. Women have dignity.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:19.800]   They deserve to be honored, and they deserve their esteem and their worth.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.600]   And yes, there have been many abuses for generations, and women have been
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:30.120]   oppressed and wrongly abused, backed up by bad uses of Scripture.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:37.400]   That's all true. But the Bible says a man is a man, and a woman is a woman,
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:43.640]   and the functions are different. Not better or worse, different.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:51.240]   So for ladies, do not let Facebook or CNN or Fox News even or whatever have you
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:56.120]   dictate what it means to be a woman, a modern hip woman of God.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:03.800]   That doesn't make any sense. And guys, we need to man up because there's becoming a
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.760]   less and less...like, we need to be chivalrous. Walk the ladies to the cars.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:14.680]   Open doors, even if they think you're weird. We need to...and I know heebie-jeebie way,
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:21.080]   where you're like, "Hey." No, I don't know about that. But we need to man up.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   Because if men man up, women naturally are...they don't have a problem following.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:35.400]   But because men don't stand up, women are like, "We got to take their space."
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:44.560]   And you think they enjoy that? No. I think we need more godly men so that
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:52.800]   we can have more godly women. It's just...the definition of manhood,
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.080]   womanhood has been kind of confused because of secular thinking.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.280]   I mean, secularism is broad, but you guys know where I'm going with this, right?
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:05.880]   What the world tells you is wisdom is folly. Stick to God's word.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:16.160]   So how do we combat this? Flee. The Greek word...okay, number one,
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.520]   flee from. This is not on the chart. And I'm going to send this to you,
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.600]   so you don't need to...just pay attention. You're going to write it down.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.480]   Sometimes you need to flee from the devil. Did you know the Bible never tells you
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:30.440]   to engage the devil? "Hey, yo, Satan, I got this.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.120]   Jesus is behind me. I got...what's up?" You know, that's not what you're
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.920]   supposed to do. Even the archangel Michael doesn't do that.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.480]   He goes, "The Lord rebuke you." No one, even in the angelic realm,
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:48.280]   can face Satan alone. So for a church that actually teaches you how to cast out demons
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:52.920]   and all this stuff, that is very dangerous territory because you end up possessed.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:57.920]   Okay? That's where cultish practices become very psycho and crazy.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.400]   But you're supposed to always be running away from him. If you see him...
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:07.120]   If there was a lion that actually came into our...some of you guys are probably
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.080]   scared of dogs even. But if there was a big animal that walked into this door,
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:17.200]   you know where all of us would go? We would all go there. If the lion moves this way,
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.960]   you know where we'll all go? We will all go here. Forget the lion,
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.800]   maybe like a hippo or an alligator. If they were there, we would all go
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.840]   as far away as we could. True or false? Yes. You wouldn't be like,
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.600]   "Well, let's see how close I can get to the lion without getting bit."
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.920]   You would not do that. Run away. Because the Greek word for flee is phwege,
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:41.840]   where we get the word fugitive. What happens if a fugitive gets caught?
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.400]   Well, today it's incarcerated. Back in the day, it was executed.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:50.360]   Phwege, run away, like your life depends on it. And flee to God.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.840]   Three, if you need to fight, because sometimes the Bible says you need
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:58.080]   to fight, fight smart. Do you guys know what the sword of the Spirit is?
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.560]   Like, what does it say in Ephesians 6? What's the sword of the Spirit?
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.320]   The Word of God. Why do you need to obsess over getting the Bible in your head?
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:12.200]   Because when you try to search through it and you're being attacked, it's too late.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:20.800]   So, a soldier, he goes into war. When does he put the bullets into his gun?
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:30.360]   When the bullets start flying? No, they go in ready. So, the way you need to fight is
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:36.280]   through his word and prayer. Fight smart. But then fight sober.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:42.280]   Because if you fight encumbered, you're going to lose. So, and what happens
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:50.560]   if you lose? You die. Remember how the Eskimo kills the wolf.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:57.520]   That is closer to how Satan goes after us than most illustrations I've ever heard.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.160]   How does Eskimo kill a wolf? By appealing to its lusts.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:06.280]   By appealing to its instinct. By appealing to what it thinks is good.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.680]   So, what you guys are going to do is, I ran over about 10 minutes.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:15.080]   If in your groups...hopefully this was a helpful workshop.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.720]   It's not like a boring one, right? Okay? In your groups, hopefully there's enough
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.680]   information that you guys can go over with each other. You don't need to go
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:29.160]   through all the large minds because you don't have time. I mean, today.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:36.200]   But write down one trap, at least five, in your groups. Write down maybe five traps
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.560]   that you feel like are laid out for you. And like I said, for me,
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.640]   alcohol is not it at all. You could drink in front of me, I'm like, "Pfft."
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.440]   I mean, don't do that because you're just going to stumble other people.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.920]   But I'm like, "It doesn't bother me at all." It never has.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.880]   But there are other things that will derail me that might not derail you.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.400]   Fourth season, actually, it was Legos. I have a really big Lego collection
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.600]   at home that I'm not proud of that I'm saving for my kids. Okay?
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.480]   But for some reason, all my free money...don't look down on me.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.720]   I bought the newest Legos when I was in college. Okay? Yeah, dork, huh?
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:21.400]   Don't judge me, dude. All right? So what is your instinctive lust Achilles heel?
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:27.560]   Write down about five. What are you inclined to pursue of these
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:37.080]   lard minds? How do you think practically to battle it? It is not to try harder.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.280]   How are you going to flee? Who are you going to flee to?
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.280]   How are you going to fight? Oh, sorry, I'm supposed to point here, right?
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:53.880]   How are you going to fight? And what are some memory verses that you
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.040]   can think of and you can look through the scriptures and commit to memorizing this
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:04.280]   at some point that'll help you fight? The people who've done Proverbs with me,
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:09.560]   I make you guys memorize one proverb per chapter per day. Why?
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.080]   Because you usually will memorize what you feel you need.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.960]   So write down a verse that you need, or two, or five, and commit them to memory
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:25.240]   so that all of your, like, faculties are awake so that you can fight better.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.440]   Sounds good? And the more honest you guys can be with each other, the better,
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.160]   because I will guarantee you, you are not the only one struggling in this.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.560]   The enemy likes us isolated because it's easier to knock off somebody when he's
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.400]   by himself than when there's a team. Okay? So share, pray.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.800]   And if you can get through, like, nine, I mean, I'm sure you can't,
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.960]   but just, I mean, whatever you can do, but at least maybe five that you can share
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.360]   with each other. And then in the back, on the bottom,
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:57.400]   it says, "Even in your group, break off into twos or threes and come
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:02.280]   up with some kind of system that after today, someone can check up on you."
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.000]   How are you doing with that? "Dude, I'm struggling."
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.560]   Yeah, me too. "Hey, let's get up and let's keep moving,
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:12.680]   because struggling is better than dead." I appreciate it when you guys struggle,
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:18.200]   because that means you're alive. Okay? And you struggle hardest when you're
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.880]   at the beginning of death. You're like, "Mm," right?
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:27.520]   You're fighting. Don't weaken. And help each other not to weaken.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.960]   Fight together. Okay? So find out how you guys can keep each
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.440]   other accountable, pair off, and this is after you guys have a
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:44.520]   group discussion. And then have lasting, like, accountability friends that will
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:50.720]   help you. All right? So let's pray, and then we'll break you off.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.440]   And then what time did we say? Who gave the announcement?
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.720]   Did Sarah? Marsha? What time did we say we're going to have lunch?
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.960]   - We're going to have lunch. We're going to pick up at 12.15.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.240]   - 12.15? Okay.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.840]   - And then we'll be done by 12. - Okay.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.520]   Then at 12.10, let's get back together, and then we'll have a time of just final
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.160]   praise and just a time of prayer, and then we'll break it off.
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.680]   At 12.10. Try not to come later. And if you guys are all going to lunch,
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:24.080]   if you go with different people, share. Share some of the stuff that you wrestle
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.400]   with because I guarantee you, I'm not the only one who struggles
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.520]   with all of these. Raise your hand if you think you struggle
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:34.120]   with all of them. Yeah, some of you are like, "I don't struggle
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.960]   at all. I am saved." But just remember, Colossians 2, 9 to 15,
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:43.160]   you are not condemned. He has canceled the certificate of death
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.400]   that consisted of decrees against us which stood opposed to us.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.440]   He took it out of the way, nailed it to the cross. So there is no ruler authority,
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:55.440]   no demonic force that is over us. But we'd like to submit ourselves
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.520]   under them again, right? Satan has zero control over you.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.560]   And that's something to remember, Colossians 2, 9 to 15. Amen?
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.120]   Let's pray. Father, thank you.
