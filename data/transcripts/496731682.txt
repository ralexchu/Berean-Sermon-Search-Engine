[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to 1 Peter 4, verse 7.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.080]   Because it is a new year, we want to introduce our theme verse and the focus that we were
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.200]   trying to establish in 2021.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.560]   We have no idea what's going to happen in 2021, but we want to be intentional in what
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.880]   we're pursuing.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.640]   And so each year we do an evaluation of where we are as a church and according to our fourfold
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640]   vision, what are some areas that we need to be strengthened in.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.120]   And so this is the verse that we want to focus on, "Watch and pray."
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.480]   So you've probably seen our artwork.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.800]   And so that's going to be something that you're going to see.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.760]   And so I wanted to introduce that to you before I jump back into the book of Hebrews.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.400]   So we're reading 1 Peter 4, verse 7.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.520]   The end of all things is near.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.520]   Therefore be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.520]   Let's pray.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.960]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your grace.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.720]   And we pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit would open our eyes.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.320]   Convict us, Father God, that we may see your glory, that we may have a greater and greater
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.560]   deepening appreciation and love for who you are, that our whole life would simply be a
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.280]   reasonable response to what we profess to believe.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   We thank you for your grace in 2020.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.000]   And we pray, Father God, that same grace would continue to guide and lead your church in
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   2021.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.160]   Lord, as we give our first fruits to you, may it be multiplied.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.080]   May it be something, Lord God, that you push our church toward and asking, Lord, for your
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080]   help to do so.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.080]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   Amen.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.040]   So the theme for 2021 is "Watch and pray."
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.320]   So prayer is our primary focus that we want to push in 2021.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.960]   Every year we look at our church, we look at, you know, our strength, our weaknesses.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.240]   We have meetings, we take evaluation and say, you know, these are things that we should
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.400]   focus on.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.680]   And obviously there's a lot of things that we can give our attention to, but this is
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.160]   something that we've actually pushed and talked about for many years.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.000]   And if you've been at our church for more than three, four years, you know, probably
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.840]   this has been our theme going forward each year.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.680]   And so, but as we evaluate, we come again that this is something that we really need
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.840]   to give our attention to, not just to talk about it, not just to give sermons about,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.120]   but really give attention to.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.280]   You know, every person has a blind spot.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.020]   You know, there's certain things that you're kind of aware of, but you don't realize how
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.320]   bad it is until you get married.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.280]   And then your wife or your husband will make sure you know, right?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.600]   And so that's a benefit of being married in some sense.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   And whenever you live in a community, right?
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.400]   When you're a community, you have blind spots that you kind of get poke at.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.080]   So if you're humble, you'll receive it.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   And if you're not, you'll fight back.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.880]   We have a blind spot in the Western church that we are aware of, but I don't think we
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.760]   know how serious it is.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.680]   If I came up here on Sunday, this morning, and I say, you know what?
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.200]   I didn't have any time this week to prepare for my sermon.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.520]   I didn't get to read my Bible.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.880]   I'm just going to wing it.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.960]   I'm going to let the Holy Spirit speak this morning.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.280]   Every other week it was me, but now I'm going to let the Holy Spirit speak, right?
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.440]   I think most of you, you know, who came to hear the Bible and said, what are you doing
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.440]   up there?
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   Right?
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.800]   If you didn't prepare for the sermon, don't get up there and waste our time.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.460]   Just pray and get off.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.760]   Because we value the word of God.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.520]   The word of God needs to be exposited.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.120]   We need to have high priority in making sure that the word of God is taught, preached.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.640]   And in order to do that, I need to prepare.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.040]   But in the Western church, including our church, you know, if I said, I didn't have time to
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.680]   pray, I didn't spend much time in prayer, I didn't think about it, you know, say, yeah,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   it's understandable.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.280]   That's a discipline that we're weak in, and then we just move on.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.680]   Prayer in scripture is just as important a proper exposition of God's word.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.240]   In the Eastern church, you know, in the Asian churches, they tend to be strong in prayer,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.400]   maybe weak in theology, but very strong in prayer.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   Their response would be exactly the opposite.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.200]   The pastor came up and said, you know, I didn't prepare and I didn't pray much and I haven't
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.600]   been praying at all, you know, and they said, what?
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.640]   What are you doing up there?
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.520]   How can you be a pastor and be preaching a sermon if you're not praying?
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.020]   And in the same way, this blind spot in the Western church is not a small problem.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.560]   I would say it is the problem in the church.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.000]   The Bible says you did not have because you did not pray.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.440]   Our typical response to whenever there's a problem is let's get organized, let's have
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.360]   a meeting, let's see what theological things that we've missed, you know, let's have a
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.000]   class, let's train these people, let's do these things and let's get to it, right?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.440]   And let's do a good job.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.640]   And that's our typical response.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.860]   And none of that is wrong.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.300]   And there is a place for all of that.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.460]   But if you know the scriptures as well as I do, right, which, you know, all of you know
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:40.100]   the scripture and you've read it, the Bible places prayer just as high as value as the
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.460]   Word of God.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.820]   So that is a big blind spot in the Western church.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.220]   And part of the reason why we talk about the weakness of the church is probably that.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.300]   Without prayer, we automatically become anxious.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.540]   When things happen and things don't go according to plan, we become anxious because we're not
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.040]   sure where God fits into all this because we haven't been engaging with God.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.140]   In fact, sometimes it's even worse when you are successful and things are at peace because
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.340]   we automatically think it must be because something I'm doing.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.740]   So either we are prone to anxiousness or we're prone to pride, thinking that we know the
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.540]   answers.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.280]   Either way, when we don't pray, it is detrimental.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:34.300]   Knowledge and experience without prayer causes us to rely on knowledge and experience.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.780]   If you think you have greater intellect, if you have more experience, maybe you're a bit
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.640]   more gifted.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.260]   Without prayer, it automatically leads to self-glory.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.940]   It leads to pride.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.540]   Prayer is essential, not important, essential in our walk with God.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:02.020]   Without it, we don't even know if we're right with God or not right with God.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.220]   So this is a glaring weakness in our church.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.180]   And so this is something that we've, every time we talk, it's like this is something
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.180]   we need to deal with.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.180]   This is something we need to deal with.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.180]   This year, we're hoping that we would do more than just give you a verse or give a sermon
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   and to encourage you to pray.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.020]   We've tried to implement morning prayer, Friday night prayer.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.180]   We had praise and prayer implemented, but I think all of that is just a slight nudge
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.660]   and we want to do more than that.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.360]   We want to emphasize prayer to the extent that we emphasize the Word of God.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.760]   And so that may not happen overnight, but we want to make sure that we're headed there
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.340]   as a church because I believe, and I think we all believe, that it is that important.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.500]   And it is a weakness in our church beyond anything else.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.340]   1 Peter 4, 7, the text that we want to focus on this morning, he says, "End of all things
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.340]   is near.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.580]   Therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.220]   So I want to break this down into three parts.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.100]   First, the motivation of prayer, right?
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.540]   Why we should pray.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.420]   Second, preparation for prayer.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.460]   What is it that we are called to do?
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.020]   And then third, the power of prayer.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.480]   And that's the outline for this morning.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.460]   The motivation for prayer is pretty simple.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.340]   He says, "The end of all things is near."
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.220]   Peter wrote this 2,000 years ago.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.660]   If the motivation is that the end is coming, well, 2,000 years have passed, so how can
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.940]   we have any kind of urgency talking about something 2,000 years ago and then say, "Well,
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.940]   end of all things is near."
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.020]   Clearly, it didn't end.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.660]   So how are you going to preach a sense of urgency in prayer when 2,000 years have passed
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.500]   and clearly things didn't end?
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   What does he mean by that?
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.020]   And is this relevant to us today?
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.140]   Well, some people have thought that maybe the end that he's referring to is the physical
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.220]   death of the Christians, which was exactly what was going on.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.660]   First Peter has written during the period when Nero's persecution was intense.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.760]   People were literally being torn apart by lions.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.800]   They were being crucified on the cross publicly to shame them.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.820]   This is the period when the apostles are starting to get caught and beheaded, and one by one,
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.700]   the church is being destroyed.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.780]   So some people thought that maybe what Peter is saying, the end, meaning physical end of
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.720]   Christians is near, so you better be ready.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.780]   Some people thought that maybe this is referring to the end of Israel, that the old covenant
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.140]   is ending, and so Israel, there's no place for them anymore, and so we know what happens.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:42.500]   This is written around 65 AD, and in AD 70, the Romans come in, completely abolish the
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.160]   nation of Israel.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.460]   They got sick and tired of their many rebellions, and they came in, destroys the temple so that
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.340]   they can't worship, and Israel as a nation just disappears.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.020]   So they scatter all over, but as a nation, they disappear.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.660]   So some think that Peter saw this coming and saying, "The end of all things is near, so
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.840]   you better get ready."
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.060]   The word that is used here for end in Greek is telos, where we get the original word is
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.060]   teleos.
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.260]   And I think I mentioned this to you before.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.820]   Back in seminary, this word was so significant in our understanding of the New Testament
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.860]   that I did a whole paper just on this particular word, teleos.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:27.220]   The word teleos is never used in the New Testament to refer to the chronological end of something,
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.180]   that there's a beginning, there's a middle, and there's the end.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.180]   So it can't be referring to the nation of Israel where there was a beginning, there's
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.340]   a middle, and then now he's going to abolish the nation of Israel.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.940]   The word teleos doesn't mean that.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:46.460]   The word teleos basically means a completion or consummation of something.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:52.620]   So when the Bible says that the end is near, it's that God's intended purpose or what he
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.900]   was trying to accomplish is coming to an end.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.100]   He says in 1 John 2, 18, "Children, it is the last hour."
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.980]   The last hour he's talking about is not the very last chronologically.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.820]   He's talking about the last period.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.740]   In God's salvation history, there's the last thing that God is preparing and trying to
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.740]   get the church ready for.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.900]   He says, "It is here."
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.900]   And what he says, again, the end of all things is near.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.820]   That's exactly what he's referring to.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:28.780]   And that's why Peter is able to say in 2 Peter 1, 3-4, "Seeing that his divine power has
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:35.260]   granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:40.180]   him who called us by his own glory and excellence."
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.860]   He says, "Everything that you and I need for life of godliness, for our salvation, for
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.100]   our sanctification, for our glorification has been given to us."
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.440]   They are no longer waiting for something to happen.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.020]   The Jews were given the law, but the law was not the end purpose of that.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:03.420]   The law was for the preparation of the coming of Christ so that they would see sin as utterly
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.020]   sinful.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:11.980]   But all of that is to bring Christ, and so in his death and resurrection, he would complete
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.300]   what is necessary for salvation.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.540]   That's what he means.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:22.860]   So when he says, "The end of all things is near," he's meaning that what God had ordained
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.500]   is about to be consummated.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:31.700]   That we are no longer waiting passively, hoping the Messiah would come and deliver us.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:37.140]   We're no longer waiting for the Holy Spirit to be indwelling in us to give us power so
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.180]   that we would become witnesses in Judea, Samaria, and the remotest part of the world.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.400]   We're no longer waiting for the new covenant.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.780]   We're no longer waiting for the establishment of the church and the apostles, and we're
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:54.380]   no longer waiting for the word of God to be given explaining the mystery of the gospel.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.140]   He says, "All has been given to you that is necessary."
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.060]   That's what he means by teleos, the end.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.060]   The end is here.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:08.420]   So the challenge that he's giving to them is not, "Life is hard, but you hold on to
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:14.820]   the hope of Christ, and hopefully you hunker down, find a good cave somewhere, and just
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.820]   hold on to the word of God and make it to the end."
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.820]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.520]   The end of all things is near, so you better just hold on to Christ.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.820]   This is a battle call.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.840]   And that's why Jesus says at the end of his ministry, "Go therefore and make disciples
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.340]   of all the nations."
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.980]   He says, "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.140]   The statement there is not a defensive statement.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.580]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to build my church so that you can gather together when the world
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.220]   is falling apart."
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.700]   He says, "When the world is falling apart, you guys gather together, hunker down, create
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.620]   a little bubble where the outside world is not going to be able to attack you."
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.620]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.180]   He says, "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.120]   No matter what is happening outside, they're not going to be able to prevail against the
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.120]   church, so gear up.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:10.040]   So this is not a call to escape to Colorado.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.240]   You know, I know there's a lot of temptation with all that is going on around us, that
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.520]   we want to find a cave somewhere and just hunker down for a period, but he says, "No,
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.280]   the suffering is coming."
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.400]   He says, "What God has consummated at the end time, the establishment of the church
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.560]   to take the gospel and be the light in the darkness."
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.200]   So the darker the world becomes, the greater necessity there is for the church to be in
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.840]   that darkness.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.960]   And that's what he means when all things is near.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.920]   In Romans 13, 11, it says, "Do this knowing the time that it is already the hour for you
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.800]   to awaken from sleep."
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   That if you've been sleeping, if you've been just kind of wandering around in the darkness,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   he says, "It is time to be awakened."
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.680]   And when he says to be awakened, he's not simply saying to be alert and open your eyes.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   He's saying, "See the times."
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.120]   Everything that you and I need for a life of godliness, everything that you and I, to
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.000]   be the light to the world, has been given to us.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.440]   Now the ball's on our court.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.440]   And that's what he means to gear up, right?
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.160]   Get out of your shelters.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   You don't need to wait.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   The Holy Spirit's been given to you.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.120]   Get out of your shelter and gather together.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.520]   And so he says, "So we need to pray."
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.600]   Because of the pandemic, one of the most common questions that I've been getting outside of
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.720]   is our church going to be open or closed, right?
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.960]   That's probably the number one question.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.200]   The number two question is, do you think Jesus is coming?
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.520]   And of course the answer is yes.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.480]   Of course the Bible says he's coming.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.480]   The next question is when?
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.280]   Now if I tell you when, you shouldn't listen to me anymore.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.680]   The Bible says I will not know the time or the hour.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.320]   But we should be able to tell the signs of the time.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.440]   And so whether he comes in our generation, next generation, there is more awareness of
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440]   something going on.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.380]   In fact, more and more non-Christians are asking the question.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.400]   There must be something beyond this world.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.540]   Now the fear of death and this pandemic has caused people to be more aware of the finiteness
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.960]   of our life.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:25.440]   And so he's basically saying, "Gear up, open your eyes, be ready."
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.120]   Because the end of all things is near.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.600]   Persecution is going to increase, but the opportunity to share the gospel is also going
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.680]   to increase with the persecution.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.760]   And he's basically telling us our motivation to pray, to gear up for this spiritual battle
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.600]   that he called us to.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:50.100]   When we are not in battle mode, if we're constantly living in a state of seeking the
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:55.860]   comfortable, most comfortable place for us, then there's no need for prayer.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.220]   You know how to find jobs.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.180]   You know what to do to get good grades.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.180]   You know how to make money.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.300]   You know how to make friends.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.240]   You know how to get organized.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.460]   You don't need Jesus for that.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.680]   Sometimes the way that we pray, we kind of sprinkle Jesus on everything that we do.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.300]   We sprinkle in Jesus' name, kind of like the Catholics.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.180]   I cringe every time I see somebody do that because they think that this has some sort
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.180]   of power.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.140]   But the thing is, the Protestants do the same, in Jesus' name.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.500]   You attach Jesus' name, kind of like doing this.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:31.980]   As long as I sprinkle Jesus on our fellowship, sprinkle Jesus on Bible study, sprinkle Jesus
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.140]   on this, then God is obligated to answer our prayers.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.700]   So the kind of prayer that he's calling us to pray is a battle cry.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.060]   And that's why he tells us to gear up.
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:47.180]   And so the motivation is, get ready because in the end times, God is going to establish
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.280]   the church and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   You know what that means?
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.820]   That the gates of Hades are going to try.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.340]   Gates of Hades is going to do its best to break down its walls and destroy the church.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.260]   But he said, because I will establish my church, they will not prevail against it.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.140]   So he says, that's where the motivation is.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.220]   So if we're not aware of the times, if we're living our life to be as comfortable as we
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:19.220]   can, making sure we have the best life that we can during this life, then again, not only
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:24.020]   is our perspective wrong, it will affect the day-to-day way that we live our lives.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.980]   We're going to look for caves to hide in.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.860]   We're going to go to only places where we are safe.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.440]   We can only share the gospel if we are welcomed into that area.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.540]   And we will constantly live our lives based on the value that we have.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.540]   But he says, no.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.820]   That's one of the benefits of persecution and hardship because it forces us out of our
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.820]   comfort zone.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.260]   And that's what he's speaking to.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.780]   He's speaking to a group of people whose lives have been torn upside down because of the
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.780]   gospel.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.440]   And he's saying, good, get ready.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.280]   Get ready because the time has come.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.000]   The end has come.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Motivation for prayer.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.860]   Secondly, he says, to prepare.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.540]   If you're properly motivated because the end of all things is near, he says, you need to
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.980]   prepare for prayer by being of sound judgment and of sober spirit.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:22.180]   Sound judgment in Greek is sophroneo, which literally means to be wise in thinking.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.900]   And that's what it means in Romans 12 when he says, do not be conformed to the world
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.780]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.980]   Renewing of your mind.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.200]   And that's where we are committed to the Word of God to make sure that we have a biblical
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.260]   perspective.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:43.000]   That our opinions are not based upon what's happening around us politically, socially,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.840]   economically.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:51.600]   If we're not in the Word of God, we naturally are going to have a different perspective.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.060]   Where does your knowledge, where does your truth come from?
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.080]   But when he says, not to be conformed by the renewing of your mind, some of us may think,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.600]   you know, I've been studying the Bible for a long time.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.680]   I know this text.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.840]   I know the biblical principles.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.320]   I know the theology.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.000]   You can have all of that and be completely wrong because the Bible says in the book of
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.840]   Hebrews the Word of God does what?
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.600]   First and foremost, judge the thoughts and intentions of my heart.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   If we pray, when somebody is studying the Bible without much prayer, typically what
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:32.920]   happens is the Word of God is used to judge the thoughts and intentions of others' hearts.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.800]   Because I know the Bible, it becomes a tool to weed out sin in our community.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.440]   It becomes a tool to weed out sin in other people's hearts.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.760]   But we are completely unaware of what's going on inside of us.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.520]   So that's what happens when you study the Bible without much prayer.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:56.960]   In fact, I will say it is dangerous to study the Bible without prayer.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.320]   It is dangerous to have right theology without prayer because right theology gives you self-righteousness
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.620]   to judge other people.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:12.720]   The primary purpose of the Word of God is to keep us sober, sober in judgment.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:20.680]   You know, again, the benefit of hardship that we faced or some people faced in 2020 and
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:26.320]   even prior to that, many of you have experienced hardship unrelated to the pandemic, just your
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.780]   family economically, maybe something else happened.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:37.960]   But there are times when God, when we are sober and in our right thinking, we recognize
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.660]   that what God is doing in the hardships and the world that He's shaking up is actually
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.960]   the best thing that could have happened for us.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.440]   When we're not sober, our greatest concern is our safety.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.800]   When we're not sober, our greatest concern is making sure that we have our best life
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   now.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:03.480]   But when we are sober, we recognize that we're going to live in eternity in Christ, whether
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:09.760]   you live 90 years or whether you live 50 years or 30 years, it is trivial in light of eternity.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.180]   So our greatest concern should not be that I'm going to be living a healthy life till
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.100]   I'm 90.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.240]   But when we're not sober, that becomes our primary concern.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.120]   When we're not sober, the primary concern is, do I have enough money to take care of
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.120]   my family?
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.640]   Am I going to be able to buy this house or am I going to be able to invest in this?
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.800]   Am I going to have enough for retirement?
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.640]   In and of itself, there's nothing wrong with any of that.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   We should be wise.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.160]   We should be shrewd with the things that God has given us.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.400]   But from an eternal perspective, all of that stuff, according to Apostle Paul, is rubbish
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.560]   in light of knowing Christ.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:49.120]   So when we're not sober, we're naturally given to worldly concerns.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.940]   And so that's why he's saying the end of all things is near, so therefore be sober in your
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:23:00.800]   judgment so that what we are thinking, how we are feeling, is being dictated by what
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.160]   we profess to believe in eternity.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:12.360]   You know, it is the most, when we are the most frustrated, when we long for eternity.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.600]   And that's the best thing that can happen to Christians.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:25.760]   So God will allow you to feel frustrated because it shakes us up from our temporary safety.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.400]   People who can't gather together long for fellowship.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.780]   One of the benefits of when our church shut down for a period when people couldn't come,
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.340]   one of the things that I kept on hearing is how much they love the gathering of the church.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.560]   I didn't hear that before.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.600]   Not that it wasn't there, but it brought it out.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.560]   I didn't realize how important fellowship was until it was taken away.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:53.040]   You ever see videos of people who don't have direct access or easy access to the written
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   word of God?
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.640]   You ever see videos of that in remote parts, even some parts in China where they don't
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.720]   have the written word and they get the Bible for the first time and it's just amazing how
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:09.080]   much they cherish the word of God because they didn't have access.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:14.280]   Part of the benefit of the persecution and the hardship that is here and that will continue
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.680]   to come is that it causes us to long for eternity.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.960]   That's what he means by being sober in our judgment.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.720]   That we should not be shaken back and forth by what's happening outside the world.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.360]   The Bible says that that was going to happen.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.440]   We shouldn't be taken off guard by that because it's been here in the scriptures all along.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.680]   Sometimes, God will allow certain things to happen.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:49.000]   When we are sober, when we are biblically sober, spiritually sober, it causes a hungering
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.520]   and thirsting for righteousness that probably wasn't there before.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.480]   And that's what he means, to be sober in judgment and then to be sober in spirit.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:02.520]   In the King James Version, literally it just says to watch, to be sober-minded and to watch,
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.520]   to look carefully.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.740]   The former emphasizes internal thinking and internal feeling.
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:14.200]   The second part, the latter, is talking about clear judgment in the way that we live, to
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   be self-controlled.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:23.520]   Ephesians 5.15, it says, "Therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise."
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.320]   You know, remember Pastor Nate's sermon last week when he was giving the sermon about the
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   ten virgins?
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.840]   He had the five wise and the five unwise.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:38.440]   And he said that the difference between the wise and unwise is preparedness and unpreparedness.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.880]   And preparedness and unpreparedness is directly linked to what you value.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.160]   If you value something, you prepare.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.000]   If you don't value it, you don't prepare.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.280]   And a distinction between the virgins who are saved and the virgins who are not saved
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.560]   is how they live their lives to prepare for the coming of their master.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.320]   And that's exactly what he is saying, is be careful how you walk.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:06.920]   Is the way that we live our life consistent with the second coming of Christ?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.680]   Is it consistent with the gospel that we profess?
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.400]   You know, let me talk to our young families.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.840]   When I say young families, I'm talking about all of us.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.040]   We're all part of that, right?
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.120]   The danger when we're young, when we're starting to raise our children, or even when they get
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:32.200]   older, is that raising our kids and protecting them, providing for them, becomes our greatest
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.160]   value in life.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.920]   It is important, but it becomes the greatest value in life.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:47.080]   And we evaluate what is godly and ungodly based upon, am I taking good care of my kids?
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.120]   Now, does the Bible teach that?
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:55.600]   Yes, there are times when the Bible says that in order to be an elder in the church, you
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.560]   have to have, right, you have to manage your household well, right?
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.800]   Not to aggravate your children.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.160]   There's many commands in the scripture telling us to be good fathers.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.520]   But at the same time, it also says, "He who loves his father and mother more than me is
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.840]   not worthy to be my disciple."
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.640]   And so the Bible tells us both ends.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.680]   And so sometimes living in Orange County, we think that providing what is physically
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.280]   best for our children is what it means to be godly.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.300]   We have to be careful that we do not get fooled.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:37.040]   And Satan often uses that to distract us from our primary pursuit of honoring and glorifying
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   God.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:45.320]   And what is best for your children is what causes them to love Christ the most.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.600]   And it's not always the physical safety.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.240]   It's not always the best schools.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.360]   It's not always teaching them everything they need to know.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   Do they love Christ?
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:02.560]   That's when, so when he says to live in such a way that we recognize that it is temporary,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.800]   even if they go to the best schools, even if they get the best education, even if they
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:12.840]   get the best job, even if they have the best marriage, that is not our primary goal.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:19.200]   Our primary goal is, are they also walking soberly with Christ?
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.680]   What's the difference between foolish and prudent living?
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.120]   Are we preparing for what is coming?
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.640]   Or are we preparing for a better life here?
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:36.040]   But third and finally, the motivation of prayer is clear.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.720]   Preparation of prayer to live righteously, to be sober in thinking, to engage in the
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.800]   word of God, to memorize it, to meditate it, to apply it, let it judge the thoughts and
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.160]   intentions of our heart.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.320]   If I stop the sermon here, it may be good to say, "Okay, I like a few things that he
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   said.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   Yes, we need to be righteous.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.480]   We need to disciple people.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.760]   We need to be able to do this and that."
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.240]   But you've missed the whole point.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.360]   Because the conclusion of what he says here is so that you can pray.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.920]   He says the reason why you need to be sober is not simply so that you can walk around
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.120]   and say, "I'm sober.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.440]   I'm studying the word.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.520]   I'm biblically sound.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.880]   I have the right theology."
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   He says, "No.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.920]   All of that has to happen," for what?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.720]   So that you can pray.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.680]   So that your prayer life will be effective.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.560]   So if you're studying the Bible, have the right theology, memorizing scripture, even
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.360]   teaching other people about scripture, and yet we do not pray, you missed the whole point.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.840]   Because the power is not me and you in our discipline.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.880]   The power is not in the training or in the organization.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.600]   The power is always in God.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:48.640]   You notice here in 1 Peter 3, 7, and I'm going to give you a warning ahead of time.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:54.080]   If you have any feminism in you at all, the word of God is going to blow it out of the
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.080]   water.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.040]   If not, I didn't do my job.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.440]   Now you're nervous.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   Now I'm nervous.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.120]   All right, 1 Peter 3, 7.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:12.200]   You husbands in the same way live with your wives in understanding way as with someone
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.320]   weaker since she is a woman.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.640]   You nervous now?
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   Okay.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:24.000]   Let me read it again for emphasis, all right?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.680]   You husbands in the same way live with your wives in understanding way as with someone
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.360]   weaker since she is a woman.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.080]   Now if I stop right there, some of you guys are going to say, "That's in the Bible?"
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.480]   We should switch to NIV or something, you know what I mean?
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   In this day and age, you're going to write this and you're going to read this and you
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.880]   think we should be okay with this?
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.600]   When you understand what's going on culturally, you read this completely different, right?
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:00.240]   You know, you guys all know like we live in what we call a cancel culture.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.680]   And so we have the new generation who's judging the old generation of certain things that
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.840]   they used to say and now it's like it's unacceptable, perfectly acceptable 20 years ago but you
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.360]   can't say it now, right?
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.400]   One of the clearest things that I've noticed in the last 20 years is that you can't say
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.400]   Oriental.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.360]   Some of you guys are in a generation where the Oriental is offensive to you.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.920]   I heard that growing up, you know, since I was a kid, Oriental.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.920]   There's that Oriental kid, it's like, "Yeah, right here," right?
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.200]   Because that was not a problem, right?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.600]   In fact, when we lived in Kansas, my teacher, you know, I was still using my Korean name
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.200]   at that time, she couldn't say my name so she would just say, "That China boy back there."
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.120]   And I don't remember standing up thinking like, "China boy?
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.200]   You racist."
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.120]   Whenever she said, "China boy," I said, "Here?"
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.800]   Because I was the only Asian kid in that room and she wasn't being racist, she was, you
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.960]   know, she was just distinguishing me because she couldn't say my name.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.360]   So I didn't feel the need to like, "Oh, I got to confront her."
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.480]   I never even thought twice about it until, you know, I got older and I said, "Yeah,
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.040]   she used to call me China boy."
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.280]   I don't think it was anything derogatory.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.760]   Now if she said, "That greasy Chinese kid over there," that would have been, right?
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.960]   That would have been racist.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.760]   But I didn't hear it that way because in that culture, it was just, you know, maybe there
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.960]   are some things that are positive that progress that maybe we shouldn't say.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.640]   But the fact of the matter is today, we have a younger generation who grew up in a different
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.360]   culture judging the older generation saying, "You did this, you did that, that's unacceptable,"
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.360]   right?
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.320]   And sometimes I think we get way carried away with that.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:39.080]   Now I say all of this because the Bible was written 2,000 years ago in a completely different
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.700]   culture.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:47.240]   You have to understand that when this passage was written, women had no right to vote.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.560]   They had no right to own property.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.360]   They were actually considered property of the man.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.480]   So if she didn't cook the food right, he could have just said, "You know, I don't like her,"
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.600]   and send her off.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.040]   And because she had no right, she was forced to either be homeless or sell her body to
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.240]   take care of herself and possibly her children because the wife and the children had no rights
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.240]   of their own.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:16.280]   That's why when they had the, if you're eating under 5,000, they only counted the men.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:22.000]   With 600,000 people went into the desert, they only counted 600,000 men.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.440]   And that's the culture that they lived.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:30.600]   So when the first century Jew read this passage, this is how they would have read it.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.320]   You husbands in the same way, live your wives in an understanding way as with someone weaker
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.200]   since she is a woman.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.560]   Of course.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.360]   That's what they understood.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:46.400]   And show her honor as fellow heir of the grace of life.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.640]   What?
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.720]   Fellow heir?
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.040]   You know what a Jewish male used to pray?
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:03.840]   "Thank God I'm not a Gentile, a dog, or a female."
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:11.240]   And the reason why they prayed that is because they were treated so poorly by the Jewish
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.800]   community.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.920]   So it wasn't necessarily that they were being, you know, like harsh.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.920]   It was just, "Thank God."
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.040]   It's just like somebody who you see suffering.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.080]   "Thank God God didn't make me like them."
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.480]   That's where the women were.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:30.960]   So what would have shocked a first century Jewish male is not they are weaker because
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   they're women.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.200]   Of course they are, because we see it.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   We see it.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   They get treated poorly.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   They're living homeless.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.840]   They're prostituting their bodies because their husband who was a jerk let her go because
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.680]   she burned food.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:52.880]   But the shocking part of it is, "Show her honor as fellow heir of grace of life."
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.880]   And so the way that we respond to this text is exactly the opposite of how the Jewish
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.200]   male would have read this text.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.760]   Because what God was doing was completely revolutionizing that the value of a woman
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.280]   is not dependent upon her physical strength.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:16.160]   But she has value because God says she is a fellow heir of the grace of God.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.160]   Fellow heir.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   There is no male or female in the kingdom of God.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:29.720]   And so he was demolishing the prejudice of men at that time that might is power.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.440]   And so what he was doing was completely the opposite.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:37.280]   So when we read this with a feministic mindset, we say, "How can he possibly say that?"
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.240]   Not realizing it was because of Christ, he completely revolutionized not only Christianity
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.120]   but world itself.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:53.160]   Because Christianity was the first religion, first paradigm shifting toward female.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.920]   It was because of Christianity.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.840]   Now why do I say all of that and what does this have to do with anything?
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.680]   Because he says, "All of that, treating your wife with honor," which would have been very,
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.360]   very difficult for them to do in the first century.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   He says, "So what?
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.560]   So that your prayers would not be hindered."
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.240]   Think how radical that is that God elevates women to the point that if you don't take
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.680]   care of your wife, you can't even pray.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.560]   And the reason why you need to honor women is so that you can be effective in prayer.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.080]   That's how much he was elevating women at that time.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.900]   But the point of it is so that you can pray.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.440]   We need to live righteous lives.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.680]   We need to understand scripture.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.720]   We need to have right thinking.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.360]   All of this so that we can pray.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.840]   Because the power is in prayer.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.800]   Think how feeble you and I are.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.040]   Have you ever seen with your own eyes the coronavirus?
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.520]   I mean, I'm not talking about on the screen or television.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:02.040]   They call it the coronavirus because corona in Spanish is crown and if you look at the
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.720]   virus it looks like a crown, right?
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.440]   There are certain parts of it and that's why they call it coronavirus.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.080]   You and I have never seen that with our eyes.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.760]   It's so small, I mean, we don't know until we see the effects of it.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.320]   Well that tiny little thing that you and I can't even see with our own eyes has shut
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.960]   down the world.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:29.800]   You get sick enough, you know, you could even die from that.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.080]   That's how weak and feeble you and I are.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.960]   That's something that tiny can destroy us, mankind, period.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.800]   And so for us to think that if we get organized, if we're smart enough, if we're educated,
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.280]   if we have the right teaching, right theology, that we're going to change the world.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.760]   He said, no, all of that has to happen so that we can pray.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.120]   In the Bible it says in a large house there are articles of ignoble things and noble things.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:59.800]   He says, if you want to be used by God to get rid of ignoble things, so that we can
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:06.120]   bring an empty container, an empty container, not filled with, you know, I got this experience,
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.980]   I got this talent, I've done this, I have that.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.720]   And then we bring a container that's full and he says, all that is ignoble.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.440]   He says, no, empty yourself.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.240]   That's why the Bible keeps telling us, humble yourself, humble yourself.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.400]   And that's why the Word of God first and foremost judge the thoughts and intentions of my heart.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:30.240]   If the primary concern that we are overly concerned about is other people, you're probably
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.160]   missing the whole point.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.560]   You're not wrestling with your own sins.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.040]   You're not wrestling with your own pride.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:42.700]   You're not wrestling with your own inclination to be proud because the primary problem with
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.280]   mankind is mankind.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.960]   And that's why he says, so that you can pray.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.240]   John chapter 15, the whole chapter is about abiding in Christ.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.800]   You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in Christ, right?
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   He doesn't say it's hard.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   He says, you cannot if you do not abide in Christ.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.400]   But after he says that, what does he say?
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:12.280]   John 15, 7, if you abide in me, my words abide in you, then ask whatever you wish, it shall
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.880]   be done for you.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.200]   Why do we need to abide?
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.060]   So that we can be effective in praying.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.800]   So if we get into theology and we get organized and we have all these proper training and
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.400]   Bible classes going and we're doing all this kind of discipleship and yet we are weak in
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.480]   prayer, we missed the whole point.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.160]   The whole purpose of salvation is so that we can come to God so that God can do his
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.520]   work.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.280]   And when we don't pray, naturally we want to be worshipped.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.560]   When good things happen, we want to be recognized.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.400]   The very core of human rebellion is wanting to be glorified.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:00.080]   And so when good things, godly things happen, when we bear fruit or seemingly bear fruit,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:04.840]   church grows, discipleship happens, people acknowledge us and thank us, and we're not
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.400]   praying, we naturally think, I had some part in that.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.880]   So even the good things that happen in our lives, it leads to self-glory.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.960]   Some of us are more sophisticated so we don't say it in our mouth, but you know it, you
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:29.280]   feel it, you think it, and that thought of I did something is ruining us and we don't
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.400]   even know it.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:40.320]   Just like Jesus said, it's like a small yeast, right, leavens the whole bread.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.120]   I don't bake so I don't know how small it takes.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.160]   I've just seen baking happen.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:51.280]   It only takes a tiny little bit for that whole thing to rise.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:59.640]   It only takes a tiny little, tiny little pride, ruins everything that we're doing.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.840]   That's the primary reason he says don't establish young Christians in leadership because he's
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.960]   going to fall into the same temptation as the devil, that he wants the glory.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:12.160]   So one of the biggest struggles as leaders in the church, especially, you know, since
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:19.520]   I'm the senior pastor, the greatest struggle is not to get people sober, is not evangelism,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.200]   the greatest struggle is not training, Bible teaching, all of that is important.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.360]   The greatest struggle is I need to stay humble.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.600]   I need to recognize that I'm just a vessel for him to use.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.920]   And so that's why this is so, so important because the point of what we're doing is to
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.480]   bring us to God and be dependent upon him and him alone.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.080]   See, in John chapter 16, 20 through 24, Jesus says, "In that day you will not question me
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   about anything.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:51.800]   Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   it to you.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.960]   Until now you have asked for nothing in my name.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.960]   Ask and you will receive so that your joy may be made full."
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.200]   He said, "Up to this point, you've been praying from a distance."
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:06.240]   It wasn't an indwelling of the Holy Spirit that's groaning on our behalf.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.880]   But because the end of all things is near, because Christ has given us everything that
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.040]   we need for life and Godliness, now you can pray in my name.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.440]   So in my name, you can come.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.840]   So up to this point, you've been praying from a distance, but now you can draw near.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:28.380]   So the greatest benefit of our salvation is that we're able to pray unhindered.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.200]   That's the gift of salvation that God has given us.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:37.080]   So if we do all these other things and yet we are weak in prayer, we are weak in everything.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.860]   Ephesians chapter 6, 18 to 19, after he says, "Gear up for battle, put on the full armor
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:46.520]   of God," and he concludes by saying, "With all prayers, petitions, pray at all times
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.260]   in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.220]   for all the saints and pray on behalf that the utterance may be given to me in opening
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:01.500]   my mouth to make known what boldness the mystery of the gospel."
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:06.420]   He ends this spiritual battle by saying, "Put on the full armor of God, helmet of salvation,
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:13.740]   breastplate of righteousness," and then he says, "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:19.500]   After you've done all of that, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:24.780]   Whatever is happening in your life, whatever is happening in your life, if you're not praying,
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.720]   your primary problem is you're not praying.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:33.920]   Whatever is happening in our culture, whatever that may be, if you're not praying, the primary
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.080]   problem is we're not praying.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.860]   Whatever you notice in your marriage that you're frustrated with, whatever you are
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:47.140]   thinking about your husband or your wife, if you're not praying, the primary problem
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.000]   is we're not praying.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.860]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:57.060]   And then when you ask, you're not sober.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.060]   You're not sober.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.060]   You ask for your selfishness.
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.900]   So the primary problem of politics is we're not praying enough.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.880]   The primary problem with fellowship is we're not praying enough.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.740]   The primary problem with discipleship is we're not praying enough.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.820]   The primary problem with our children is we're not praying enough.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:25.780]   Until we have prayed and we have devoted ourselves to pray, until we have committed ourselves
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:32.620]   and are known for prayer as much as we are known for Bible study, everything else is
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.940]   going to be impotent.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:42.140]   Because what you and I do with our own strength is like trying to jump the Grand Canyon by
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.980]   running faster.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.300]   You and I do not have that power.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.620]   And so we recognize that this is our weakness.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.620]   This is our weakness.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.620]   This is my weakness.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.260]   This is the weakness of our church.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.980]   This is something that we've recognized for years.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:08.180]   But I feel that we've gotten to a breaking point as our church continues to grow, you
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:12.340]   know, and we have a lot of different thoughts and opinions of what we should do or should
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.340]   not do.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.140]   We need to focus on this and focus on that.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.040]   And, you know, we have all kinds of opinions.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:21.660]   Even with this pandemic, we have extremes.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.400]   Some people who are angry that we're not meeting.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.260]   Some people who are angry that we are meeting.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.860]   Some people who are angry because we don't pay enough attention to social justice.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:35.740]   Some people are angry because we're not—we're paying too much attention.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:41.580]   Out of all the different opinions that we have, there's one opinion that I welcome,
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.660]   is that you desire to pray.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.140]   We do not pray enough.
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.700]   You're absolutely right.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.700]   We need to pray.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.260]   We need to be devoted to prayer.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:46:00.620]   And until we pray, until we really give ourselves to prayer, everything that we're doing is
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:05.340]   just man's struggle.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:14.780]   You cannot bring somebody to Christ by being articulate.
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:20.700]   The Holy Spirit is the one who judges people of their sins.
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.300]   And let me tell you something that you and I absolutely cannot—we do not have the power
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.700]   to love people that are hard to love.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.340]   We can like people.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.920]   We can tolerate difficult people.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.580]   But the Scripture says that the world will identify us by love, but not any kind of love,
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.020]   but the love that Christ practiced.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.900]   The love that he says in Romans 8, "In that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.340]   us."
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.140]   You don't have the strength to do that.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.740]   I don't have the strength to do that.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:57.340]   The best that you and I can practice is love people who are likable.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.340]   Tolerate people that are difficult.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:04.820]   And try not to slander people who have hurt us.
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:11.140]   But to practice the love that Christ practiced with us, that's not in you, and that's not
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.420]   in me.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:22.500]   So until we humble ourselves and recognize that we are feeble and we are desperate, until
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:31.940]   Christ intervenes, we may have a form of godliness, but not know the power.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:36.380]   Let me finish with this, 2 Corinthians 7, 12-16.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.380]   Right after the temple was built by Solomon, in dedication, this is what the Lord says
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.780]   about the temple.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:47.880]   "The Lord appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, 'I have heard your prayer and
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.680]   have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:58.140]   If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:05.380]   the land, or if I send pestilence among my people, and my people who are called by my
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:12.260]   name humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:17.700]   I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:22.420]   Now my eyes will be opened and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.'"
