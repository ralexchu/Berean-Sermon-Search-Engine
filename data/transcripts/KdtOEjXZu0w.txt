[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:05.480]   - All right, good morning.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.440]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.960]   As you guys know, this is our Christmas service.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.120]   So the order of worship and the program
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.920]   is a little bit different today.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.640]   We're gonna, after the worship set,
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.060]   we're gonna have our children come up here
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.360]   and they're gonna do their annual presentation.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.920]   So I don't know where the parents are.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.840]   So if you're gonna come up to the front
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.320]   to do it before, and then you can take your pictures
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.440]   and videos at that time.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.400]   So it's gonna be after the worship set.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.360]   But let me give a few announcements before we get started.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.380]   Next Sunday, we're gonna be collecting
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.300]   our annual Christmas offering that we will be using
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.340]   to support the missionaries from our church.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.800]   And so next week, if you can be prayerful,
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.840]   again, this is something that we do annually
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.520]   to support the missionaries that are out there
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.840]   that were sent out.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.400]   And so if you guys can be prayerful about this.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.600]   So next Sunday, we will be collecting that offering
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.080]   during the regular offering time.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.720]   And please make that a distinction.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.460]   Again, we'll announce this again from the regular offering
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.840]   so that we know that that is going to the mission's offering.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.560]   Next members session, it's gonna be a members meeting
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.100]   session, sorry, members membership class
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.920]   is gonna happen on January 16th.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.140]   It's an eight week course from nine to 1020.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.240]   And so second floor of the building, this building,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.400]   so where the children meet.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.320]   And so Pastor Nate is going to be in charge of that.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.920]   So if you want to become a member,
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.560]   this is a membership class.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.160]   If you want to become a member, the next session
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.400]   is gonna be starting on January 16th.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   I'm told that the ping pong tournament,
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.360]   the last day to sign up is this coming Friday.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.280]   So if you don't have someone to play with
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.400]   and you just want to play, you can sign up
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.180]   and they'll connect you with somebody else
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.020]   that you can play with.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.000]   It's just an opportunity to come and meet different people.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.800]   And so if you haven't signed up, please do so by this week.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.960]   And it'll happen at 6 p.m. in the cafe side.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.080]   And then afterwards, we have a New Year's service
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.400]   that will be taking place in this room at 11 p.m.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.600]   Okay, so again, if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.440]   please sign up for that.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.360]   And then lastly, our first Peter Bible study,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.880]   the next Bible study session is gonna happen
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.640]   on January 19th.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.080]   And so if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.700]   and even those of you who have been in the same home group
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.980]   for many sessions, if you guys can help us sign up for that
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.260]   because we do need to expand and move some things around
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.060]   and make sure that we have enough small group leaders.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.360]   So even if you are already signed up
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.500]   and you may end up staying in the same group,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.420]   we need you to re-sign up for that as soon as possible
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.300]   because we need to make sure that we have enough groups,
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.540]   enough homes to handle that.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.180]   So if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.100]   please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.680]   And then again, the next session will be on January 19th.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.920]   Okay, all right, so let me pray for the offering.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.760]   And then those of you who are new to the church
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.200]   or just visiting us, if you have a physical offering
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.560]   to give, we have an offering box over there
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   decorated kind of like a Christmas box.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.760]   So that's our offering box.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.560]   And then for the rest of us,
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.920]   we'll give you a minute to give electronically.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.120]   All right, let's pray.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.560]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.720]   for what it is that we celebrate today.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.200]   Help us to glean from your word.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.640]   Help us to understand, Lord God, deeply
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.040]   what it is that we have in you.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.220]   That all that we do would simply be an overflow
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.480]   of the gratitude that we have for our salvation,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.500]   for the grace that you give.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.560]   I pray that even this offering,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.600]   help us to give it to you as an act of worship,
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.920]   an act of adoration of who you are
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.280]   and may it be multiplied for your use, for your kingdom.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.440]   (gentle piano music)
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.520]   (gentle piano music)
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.600]   (gentle piano music)
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.680]   (gentle piano music)
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.760]   (gentle piano music)
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.040]   (gentle piano music)

[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   (gentle piano music)
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:49.280]   Let's all rise together, church family,

[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   As they were up here, kind of reminiscing over our very first Christmas presentation
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   from our elementary department. And as long as you guys, our church was, I think,
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   probably no more than about 30, 35 people back then. And the first presentation was
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:33.800]   to basically our family member kids, Nathan, Matthew, Jeremy, Zachary, Faith.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   Isaiah obviously was not born. I don't think Faith was there yet. But I was just kind of
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   reminiscing and thinking about that. And Faith now is one of the teachers who kind of leads
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   the seed. So she was here helping out with the first. So, making me feel old.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   [laughter]
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   But time has passed. Again, we, you know, just in the last, I think about six weeks,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   we've had eight births at church. And so we have many more coming. So you are being
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   fruitful and multiplying, obeying God's creation mandate. And again, you know, one of the
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   things that we keep, we want to keep reminding our church is, as our children come into our
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   church, obviously they're pre-members of the church. And we want to make sure that
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   everything that we're building and laboring for is going to transfer up to the next generation.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   You know, and it'd be tragedy for us to labor and to try to build a church and then
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   it gets disconnected with the next generation. So, you know, each one of these children are
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.800]   the ones who are going to take the baton for the next generation to continue to be the
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   light in the generation that they're growing up in. And as you guys know, as our culture
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   is straying further and further away from Judeo-Christian values, that we really need
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   to pray for these kids who are up here because they're going to have it tougher than what
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   we had when we were growing up. So please continue to keep them in your prayer.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter 1, we'll be reading from verse 21
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   through 25.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   Matthew chapter 1, verse 21 through 25.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   "So she will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   from their sins. Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   the prophet, 'Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son and they shall
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   call his name Emmanuel,' which translated means God with us. And Joseph spoke from his
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   sleep, Joseph woke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   took Mary as his wife, but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a son and he called
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   his name Jesus." Let's pray.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   Heavenly Father, we pray for continued grace as we celebrate the birth of Christ, Emmanuel.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   Help us to understand the impact of what it is that we celebrate this holiday season.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   Help us to know the meaning of Christmas, that not only for ourselves, but for all those
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   around us that we may be a good witness, the aurum of Christ. May your blessing be upon
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   this time, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   Now that I have children who are a bit older, I am able to get legitimate gifts.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   Where prior to every Christmas it was just one-way street.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:35.800]   So now they have their own jobs and they have money in their pocket, so each time they come
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   around they're asking, "What do you want? You want shoes? You want this? You want that?"
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   And so I'm actually benefiting from Christmas now.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   I remember years ago, I forgot how many years, maybe about three years ago,
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   they asked, three or four years they asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I think
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.800]   I told them I wanted shoes and they mustered up whatever money that they had and they bought
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   me a used pair of booster shoes. You know the Adidas? Ultra Boost. Booster, Ultra, whatever.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   Right. It's probably one of the most comfortable shoes I had, but I would never wear used shoes.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   But I wore it for a period because my children got it for me. It's the first time they were
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:22.800]   able to muster up money and get me something and so I did my best to wear it as long as possible.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   But you know when our children were younger, they would ask, "What do you want for Christmas?"
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.800]   And I'm sure some of you parents can relate, you know, because we know they don't have resources,
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   they don't have money, and so typically what I would say is I want peace and quiet.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   Right. And so they know that, "What do you want for Christmas?" It's like, "Well, only thing that you can afford
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   to give me that I'd want is peace and quiet." Well, how do you get peace and quiet?
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   Just be good to your brothers, good to your sisters, right? Because when the children are young,
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   so much of your energy is given to take care of your kids that any little help is going to be beneficial.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   So we would say, "Okay." You know, it's half joking, but seriously, we say we want some peace and quiet.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   Right. To be good to your brother, to be good to your sister.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   Christmas is the only holiday where we celebrate someone else's birthday by giving presents to other people
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   other than the person that we celebrate. Right. Christmas is a day we celebrate the birth of Christ,
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   but all of our attention is given to our brothers and sisters and friends and family
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   and to make sure that they're well taken care of. And I think it's appropriate.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:39.800]   It's appropriate because God spends so much time and energy taking care of us.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   What is it that you and I could possibly give to God that He doesn't already have?
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   He doesn't need finances. Right. There's nothing that we have that He doesn't already have in abundance.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   But for us to join Him in taking care of His children that He cares for and loves.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   And so this is a special day as we come together and celebrate Jesus's birthday.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   But I want to make sure that we understand what it is that we are really celebrating.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   And none of the things that you'll hear today is going to be anything particularly new.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.800]   How many Christmases that you've gone through.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   But I think the depth and the impact of what it is that we talk about this morning is important for us to visit.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   As Jesus was being prophesied that He was going to come, obviously He was named Jesus, Savior.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   But He said the title that was given Him was a title that was prophesied in the book of Isaiah,
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   that His name would be Emmanuel. And Emmanuel basically means that He is God with us.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   God with us. And it's important for us to understand what that means because as simple as that is,
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   and you've probably heard that word many, many times, sing it every Christmas.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   But what is the real impact of this?
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   So this morning I want to try to unpack this word Emmanuel and what does that have to do with Christmas.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   First meaning behind the title Emmanuel is pretty obvious.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   It means that Jesus is God.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   No surprise to any of you, right? You wouldn't be here if you didn't believe that.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   But the impact of that meaning, you know, again, we live in a culture where that's being challenged,
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   that sometimes even inside the church.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   Years ago I was out on campus at UCI trying to share the gospel and I met a UCI professor
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   who was challenging us and saying that Jesus never claimed to be God.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   He claimed to be the Son of God. He claimed to be a God, but not God Himself.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   At that time I wasn't versed well enough in scripture to be able to open the Bible and argue with Him.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   And I remember going back to my professors at Biola asking, you know, can you help me to understand it?
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   And he opened up a few scriptures and it was crystal clear, but at that time I couldn't.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   And I was looking, every time I go on campus I look for Him.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   You know, now I'm better equipped.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   But of all the things that I can point out, to me the greatest and the most clearest place
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   where Jesus declares to be God Himself is Matthew chapter, sorry, in John chapter 5, 21 to 23.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   This is what He says about Himself.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes."
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   That statement alone, where Jesus says, God has the power to give life and so do I.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   That statement alone would have gotten stoned.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   Because only God is the author of life.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   And He says, God has the authority and so do I.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   In verse 22, "For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son."
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   Now if the first statement wasn't blasphemous enough, the second statement He says,
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   I do even what the Father doesn't do.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   I have the authority to judge.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:03.800]   And then third, in verse 23, "So that all will honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him."
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   Do you remember how many times in the scripture where a prophet would declare God's word or they would perform miracles?
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   And they would bow down in honor of the prophet and the prophet or the angel in fear would beg them,
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   "Get back up! I'm a man, I'm a servant just like you.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   If you worship me, you will be judged and I will be judged."
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   But Jesus here says, "If you do not honor me, you do not honor the Father."
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   And so He places Himself to be equal with God.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   So any one of these statements would have been blasphemous enough because it was crystal clear.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   And that's exactly how the Jews understood it.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   Because they said, "We want to stone you, not because of the many miracles,
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   but because you being a mere man, claim to be God."
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   So Jesus made it crystal clear who He is.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   In John chapter 1, verse 1, it says,
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   You notice here He says the Word, in reference to Jesus, was with God,
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   and yet He was also God Himself.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   So we see in the very beginning of the gospel, there is a statement of His Trinitarian relationship with God the Father, the second person.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:28.800]   Because He was with God, and yet He says He also is God.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   The Bible is not ambiguous about this.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   When we say that Jesus is Emmanuel, it's declaring who He is.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   Even in our wildest imagination, we can't create something bigger than God.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   You know, like recently, we had all these Avengers movies coming out.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   I know Spider-Man is very popular right now, but among the Avengers movies, about these superheroes, right?
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   We would ask our questions, just as a fun question, you know, what superhero would you want to be?
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   What powers do you want? Right?
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   So if you're going to pick one, you're going to pick one with the most power.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   Superman. Maybe Captain... Captain Marvel, right?
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.800]   Not Captain America, Captain Marvel, right?
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.800]   So who are the most powerful?
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   Well, in recent history, they came up with another character, not necessarily a superhero,
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   but a character that can demolish all other superheroes.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:30.800]   Thanos, which happens to mean in Greek, death.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   And so they created this figure.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   If you have the five stones, that basically by clicking the finger, you can destroy half the world.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   And all the powers of the other superheroes, imaginations of all the other superheroes,
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   could not overcome this power of Thanos.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:55.800]   Even in our wildest imagination, even with all the power that Thanos has, with all the stones,
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.800]   it still functions within God's creation.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   So even in our wildest imagination, the most powerful being that was created by some of the most creative people in the world,
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   created a being that is a tiny little figure in God's creation.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   To say that Jesus is God, we need to understand the gravity of what that means.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   In Colossians 1.16, it says, "For by Him all things were created, both in heavens and on earth, visible and invisible."
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   Everything that you and I know of, plus the invisible world,
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authority, all things have been created through Him and for Him.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   I want to show you a video to illustrate, because sometimes it's easier to visualize.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   If you can play the video.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   I want you to see the gravity of what I'm talking about.
