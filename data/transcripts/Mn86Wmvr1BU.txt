[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   As we begin our worship, we're gonna sing this first song.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   It is good to praise the Lord.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   It truly is that we're gathered together
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   as the corporate body of Christ,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.360]   that we have this ability and this privilege
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.360]   to sing these songs and to honor our God.

[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   Welcome to Berean Community Church,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   for you guys who are here for the first time or visiting.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   If you are in the process of looking for a church
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.360]   and you wanna check out Berean
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   and find out more about it,
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   we do have a welcome table.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   You passed it on the way in under the blue canopy,
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   and you can find out more information about the church.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   And there is a lunch for you, if you are new,
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   on July 30th, where all the leaders will be there
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.360]   and just a good number of our church members will be there
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   to just answer any questions
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   and you can find out more about the church
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.360]   on July 30th at our welcome lunch.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.360]   I do have a few announcements.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   This summer, between July 19th to August 9th,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   if you are a brand new Christian
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   or if you're not a believer but you're seeking,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   there is a group specifically designed for you
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   to field any questions,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.360]   to explore different answers and truths.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   And so you can find out more about that on our website.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   For people who are in the family ministry,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   if you're married, you have a family,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   there's just an informal gathering
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   at Bolsa Chica Beach on Saturday,
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   this coming Saturday.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   The time says 10 to two, but it is a beach,
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.360]   so you can hang out there as long as you see fit.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   And if you have any questions,
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   you could sign up, contact the people there as well.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   If you're a member of the church,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   we have a mandatory important members meeting
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   next Sunday at 1.30 p.m.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   And we will introduce our new members
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   and we'll find out a little bit more
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   about the upcoming retreat in a month,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   amongst other things.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   So please do keep that in mind.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   I do want to welcome our Korea team back.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   They've been gone for three weeks.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   And they arrived probably around midnight last night
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.360]   in Orange County, or like today.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   And so they're probably, if they have a glow,
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   and if they look sleepy, that's probably them.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.360]   Okay, but they will share a little bit
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   over the course of the next couple weeks.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   And we just finished our VBS,
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   so all of you who've helped out at that,
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   thank you very much.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.360]   We had about 105 students at the VBS,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   so we had 130-something volunteers,
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   which means our children were really well loved upon.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.360]   And so I believe it to be just a very fruitful time.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   And so thank you for praying,
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   for those of you guys who prayed with us.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.360]   We're gonna take a time of offering,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.360]   and if you have a physical offering,
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   we have a box in the back for you.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   You can drop it off at your convenience.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   Otherwise, you can just give an offering
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   electronically via our Zelle.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   After our offering and after our time of musical worship,
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   our brother Miguel is gonna come up,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   share his testimony, and then be baptized.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   So let's pray together.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   Father, it is just a wonderful joy
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   to gather together as the family of Christ
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   here on Sunday.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   And Lord, we acknowledge this morning
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   that we're here to celebrate you.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   We're here to worship you.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   We're here to hear from you
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   and respond appropriately in a way that magnifies you.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.360]   And so we pray that you would feed us,
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   you would bless us,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   cause us to leave here having given,
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   just worship that is given in spirit and in truth.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.360]   And Lord, we bring our offerings just to say thank you.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   And Lord, give us wisdom to steward our money,
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   our resources, our time, our opportunities,
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   and even all the people that are in our lives.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   Help us to steward them well for your glory and for our joy.

[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:09.360]   (bell tolling)
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360]   - Good morning, everyone.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.360]   My name is Miguel, and this is my testimony.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   When I began college, I was a very bitter and anxious person.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.360]   My bitterness came from placing my trust on a pedestal.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   Having felt betrayed in the past, I only trusted those
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   who I felt worthy of having my trust,
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   and deep down I had hate for the ones that hardened me.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   I couldn't let go of the grudges in my heart,
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.360]   and I hated myself for it.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   As for my anxiety, it came from not knowing
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   what I was going to do in the years to come.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.360]   I remember overthinking specifically about my identity,
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.360]   not being able to understand who or what I was.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.360]   Some days I thought I was a loser.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.360]   Other days I gained confidence
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.360]   and walked around with a puffed-up chest.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   The labels I gave myself--
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.360]   sorry--the labels I gave myself were constantly changing,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.360]   always fluctuating inside.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   I couldn't help but notice the lack of structure in my life,
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   and I hated myself for that too.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   My life had no foundation, and quickly I became envious
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.360]   of those whose lives seemed like smooth sailing.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.360]   I was quick to compare my life with theirs
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.360]   and noticed all the things others had that were not in my life.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   Social media was also showing the lifestyle
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   that I believed I was missing out on.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   So my worldly desires and my fear of missing out
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.360]   led me to chase treasures on Earth.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.360]   I began a journey of seeking my own pleasures,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   trying to find ways to make me happy by my own rules.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   I trusted my thoughts and I followed my heart.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   I was too prideful and arrogant
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.360]   to see the damage I caused to those around me.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   I acted on my compulsion,
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.360]   going to parties when I felt like it,
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   getting drunk or high when I wanted to.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   At this point, my identity was placed in the things of the world.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   I was drawn by crowds and seeking worldly benefits.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   I placed my belief in the things of the world,
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   and my ideals were built in sand.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   And soon I would find out that they would all fall apart.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.360]   When I was away from all the pleasures I was seeking
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360]   and alone with my sober thoughts,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   the bitterness and anxiety caught up with me
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   with an even greater impact than before.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.360]   Nothing filled the void in my heart, and I was confused,
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.360]   feeling completely lost and alone.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   I saw no direction, no purpose, and my life to me was colorless.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   In my ignorance, I continued to chase the world,
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   thinking that it was bound to be satisfying.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.360]   I continued this way until the end of my sophomore year.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   In this process, I brought lots of stress to my parents,
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   and deep down I knew I was causing harm with my selfishness.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   But during the summer of last year,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   I was heartbroken and depressed.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   It was the most emptiness I had probably felt.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   I saw no end to my negative thoughts,
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.360]   and I almost came to conclude
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   that I would live my life like this until death.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.360]   Deep down, I still had hope for an answer,
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   but I had no clue what it was.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.360]   A few months went by, and I was still too prideful
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.360]   to accept that I was broken inside.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   In my search for an answer,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   I was eventually led to read a Bible I had.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.360]   I didn't think much of it.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.360]   I had thought the Bible was outdated
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.360]   and that we as humans evolved to a more modern mindset.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.360]   This was false, and in time I came to find out
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.360]   that my understanding was far from the truth.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.360]   I started reading the Word,
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   and I was having trouble extracting the messages.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   But within two weeks, by God's grace, I met a stranger.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.360]   My conversations with the stranger
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   went into some oddly deep talks,
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   but I sensed genuine intentions from him.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   This stranger, now a beloved brother,
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   invited me to a large group on campus
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.360]   where they went over the first epistle of John.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   It was the first time that someone explained
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   God's love for His children and the joy that comes from that,
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.360]   and how His children rejoiced in His promises.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   It was the first time I saw
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   the chains of sin cuffed onto me as well.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   1 John 2, verses 9-11, and verses 15-17 say,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.360]   "The one who says he is in the light,
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   "and yet hates his brother, is in darkness until now.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   "The one who loves his brother abides in the light,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   "and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.360]   "But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   "and walks in the darkness,
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   "and does not know where he is going
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.360]   "because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.360]   "Do not love the world, nor the things in the world.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.360]   "If anyone loves the world,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   "the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   "For all that is in the world,
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.360]   "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   "and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father,
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   "but is from the world.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.360]   "The world is passing away, and also its lust.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.360]   "But the one who does the will of God lives forever."
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.360]   In these few verses, my entire reality was explained.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.360]   The emptiness and ambiguity of my life
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.360]   was caused because of my hate in my heart,
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   the pride that I waived carelessly,
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.360]   my love for the world, and much more.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.360]   I was in complete darkness
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.360]   when the word of God restored me with hope.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.360]   I wanted to know God and understand who he was from there on out.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   That same weekend, I attended Berean for the first time.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.360]   I was welcomed with warm greetings and smiles,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   and there was a sense of genuine intention
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   when I spoke to the brothers and sisters.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   A brother came up to me, and at the end of our conversation,
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   he encouraged me to read Romans.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   As I read through the weeks to come,
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   I came across Romans 7.23.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.360]   I see a different law in the members of my body,
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.360]   waging wars against the law of my mind
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.360]   and making me a prisoner of the law of sin,
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.360]   which is in my members.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.360]   In reading this, I understood
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   that God always knew that there was a war in my body.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.360]   He knew I would sin.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.360]   He knew that sin separated me from his love.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.360]   He knew all these things before I ever existed.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   He understood my weakness.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.360]   He came to my rescue.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.360]   I came to understand that God's love is unselfish,
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   it's righteous, and it's beautiful.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.360]   God sought in my heart, and he taught me how to love.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.360]   And in receiving Christ, I am set free from the chains of sin.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   When all my hope was close to God,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.360]   Christ restored it, and he added color to my life.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   He has given me a new life, and his promises bring joy.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   His foundation never fails, and he will always be my light.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.360]   Thank you.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:28:01.360]   [applause]
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   [water pouring]
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.360]   >> Thank you for the testimony.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.360]   You understand that when you go into the water,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.360]   you're being united with Christ in his death,
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   and when you come out of the water,
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   you're being united with him in his resurrection
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.360]   so that you can walk in newness and light.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.360]   >> I do.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   >> I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.360]   and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   [cheers and applause]
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.360]   >> It's a very encouraging and real testimony.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.360]   Praise God for that.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.360]   If you guys have your Bibles,
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.360]   please turn with me to the book of Philippians,
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.360]   and we're going to be in Philippians
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   for the bulk of the morning.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   And so Philippians chapter 1, verses 9 to 11,
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.360]   and let me go ahead and read that for us,
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   and then we'll ask the Lord to feed his sheep.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.360]   Philippians 1, 9 to 11.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   "And this I pray, that your love may abound
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.360]   still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   so that you may approve the things that are excellent
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.360]   in order to be sincere and blameless
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   until the day of Christ.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.360]   Having been filled with the fruit of righteousness,
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.360]   which comes through Jesus Christ,
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   to the glory of God and praise of God."
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   Let's pray together.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   Father, we ask for you to minister through your word
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   this morning that you would feed us,
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.360]   and that Christ would be exalted,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.360]   and that we would leave here understanding
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   a little bit more of your heart for your own glory,
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.360]   your compassionate broken heart for us.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:26.360]   And I pray, Father, that you would really grow your people
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.360]   through this time.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.360]   We entrust it into your care,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.360]   and we pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   If I were to say the words "honeymoon phase,"
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   most of us in this room would understand the meaning.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.360]   A honeymoon phase or a honeymoon period
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.360]   usually refers to like a very happy beginning period
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.360]   in a couple's relationship where everything is good,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   where everything is fresh and fun,
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   and the other person in the relationship
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   can seemingly do no wrong.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   And it's hard to find anything to be unhappy about
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   in the honeymoon phase.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   And a honeymoon phase is generally meant as a good thing.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   It's a wonderful time and a beautiful period.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   And it's not just limited to romantic relationships, right?
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   A honeymoon phase is also used by people to describe
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.360]   how happy they are at their new jobs,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   at new settings, or other new situations.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.360]   And I've actually heard it also being used to say,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.360]   "Oh, like I'm really enjoying the church."
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   It's like a honeymoon.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   And the honeymoon phase is often the happiest phase,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   and it's at the height.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   And this height is at the very beginning.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   And we implicitly know that because the honeymoon
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.360]   is at such heights from the very get-go,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   it's usually just all downhill from there.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   And I'm sure you've also heard the phrase,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   "The honeymoon is over."
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   Things are no longer as good,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   and this means that now flaws are highlighted,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   weaknesses are more glaring,
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.360]   imperfections are more noticeable.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.360]   And discontentment in varying degrees starts to creep in.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   So the "Honeymoon is over" statement
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   usually means that a person has come down from the clouds
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.360]   and is now living in reality.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   And in most of our minds,
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.360]   the word "reality" usually has negative connotations.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   And both consciously and subconsciously,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.360]   every single person, Christian and non-Christian,
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   knows that we all live in a sin-corrupted
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.360]   and a very broken reality.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   And we are surrounded by imperfection,
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.360]   and we are surrounded by ugliness.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.360]   Life's default settings are imperfection and ugliness.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   And sin, the Christian knows,
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.360]   ruins and destroys everything,
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   especially everything that we celebrate
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.360]   as a good gift from God.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.360]   And we all live in this very tainted, broken,
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.360]   and ugly world.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   And we aren't just surrounded by brokenness,
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   we are broken.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.360]   We've been damaged and impaired.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.360]   And because of that,
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.360]   one of the greatest tragedies of the fall of man
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.360]   is that pleasure and enjoyment
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.360]   and even the best of things and the best of blessings
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.360]   is always short-lived.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.360]   The best of feelings comes to an end.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.360]   And you and I are experts at getting tired of things
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   and then taking even the best of things for granted.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   And that, I believe, is a tragic result of the fall.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   So think of the last amazing meal that you've had,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   maybe at a Michelin restaurant,
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   or just a wonderful vacation that you've gone on.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.360]   Are you still receiving pleasure from those experiences?
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   Think of the last thing that you really wanted to own
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   and that you saved for and that you purchased.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   Think of something that you once thought would be amazing
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.360]   to possess and now you have it.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   Is that excitement of possessing that thing still there?
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.360]   Has the excitement increased over time?
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   Probably not.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.360]   In 2009, I saved up gift cards
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.360]   and I bought this cool thing called an iPod Touch.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.360]   And I carried that and my flip phone around with me everywhere
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   and I thought I was cool guy, right?
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   And then I met someone with an iPhone 3.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.360]   I was like, "You don't have to carry two things."
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.360]   And I was dissatisfied from that point on.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   And eventually I got myself an iPhone 3
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.360]   and I was happy with it in China
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.360]   until I saw someone with an iPhone 4.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   And you know how that goes.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.360]   Even relationships are the same.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   New friendships, new relationships are great.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.360]   And I remember like the early days of dating
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.360]   when Becky called me on the phone,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   I would clear my throat actually before I answered.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.360]   And I would give her my full undivided attention
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   and I would try my best to keep her on the phone as long as I could.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.360]   And that was 2003.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   20 years have passed.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   And for sure the affection has deepened
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   but the thrill and the newness and the excitement
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   admittedly is not the same.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   Don't judge me, all right?
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.360]   My wife was in first service.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.360]   She heard it. She still loves me. She's fine.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   So even the best of things, the best of experiences,
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.360]   everything loses its luster over time.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.360]   And in our sin-corrupted flesh and in our sin-corrupted hearts,
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   we have the inability to enjoy anything or anyone consistently for long term.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.360]   And that's our reality.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:16.360]   So it does seem like every honeymoon comes to an end.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   So in this kind of reality,
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:25.360]   is it possible for a love to not only grow
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:31.360]   but to abound and then to abound still more and more?
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   Husbands, I have a question for you.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   Does your love for your wife abound still more and more
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   from your wedding day?
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   Parents, has your love abounded still more and more
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.360]   for your children over time?
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   We have a lot of new people at the church,
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   and people are excited at the church,
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   but there's a lot of us that have been here for a while.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   So for you who've been here for a while,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   does your love for this church abound still more and more today?
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   In your minds, there might be a little bit of an objection,
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   and you have the word "deepen" in your head.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:27.360]   But is abounding still more and more synonymous to deepen?
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   Because in this passage that we're reading today,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   it does not necessarily mean to deepen.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   And when we read a passage like Philippians 1, 9 to 11,
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   we acknowledge it sounds nice.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.360]   And because passages like this,
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.360]   they feel a little bit detached from our sin-tainted reality,
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.360]   so we just skim or gloss over it,
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   and we discount it as being too idealistic.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   And we may quickly and wrongly think that a passage like this
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   of Scripture is not a passage that we can apply.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   And we may put it up on a frame,
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:13.360]   but we won't think to apply it to our lives.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   And when we see passages of Scripture
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.360]   that set the bar a little too high,
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   or feel unattainable, or like too far removed from our reality,
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   we will read it, but we can be left unchanged,
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   unconvinced, and unfet.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   So this morning, I want to spend some time in Philippians 1, 9 to 11
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   just digesting it together, looking at what it means,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.360]   and thinking through how we can make application of it
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.360]   to the realities that we're currently in.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   And let me read the passage again for us.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.360]   Philippians 1, 9 to 11, "And this I pray,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.360]   that your love may abound still more and more
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   in real knowledge and all discernment,
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.360]   so that you may approve the things that are excellent
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ,
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.360]   having been filled with the fruit of righteousness
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.360]   which comes through Jesus Christ,
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.360]   to the glory and praise of God."
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   And that's a mouthful.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   It's one long sentence.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   But Philippians 1, 9 to 11 has been called
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.360]   one of Apostle Paul's richest and most outstanding prayers
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   for his churches.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   And Paul isn't just being idealistic here,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.360]   he is praying with expectation.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.360]   He is praying for a Christian reality.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   And he is praying this in a real context,
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.360]   in a real setting, to a real congregation,
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   to real, residually sin-tainted members.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.360]   And in this prayer, he communicates to the Philippian church
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   that he's praying specifically for two things.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.360]   And those two things are a little harder to discern in the English,
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   because verses 9 to 11 just reads like one long run-on.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   But in the original language, you'll see that he prays for two things.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:14.360]   He prays for, one, an exponential increase in their love,
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   and two, he prays for a perseverance in their holiness.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   And these two things are connected.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.360]   So two components to Paul's prayer.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:30.360]   One, an exponential increase in their love,
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.360]   and a perseverance in their holiness.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   So first he prays that not only that they love one another,
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   but that their agape love will abound,
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   and then abound still more and more.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   So Paul prays for something supernatural here.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   He actually doesn't command this.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.360]   He prays this.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.360]   And he prays that God will not just help them preserve
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.360]   or maintain a status quo level of love,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.360]   but rather that their love would increase
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   and then abound still more and more.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:16.360]   And that love is both rooted in and it spurs on holiness.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.360]   And that love moves its recipients toward greater holiness.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.360]   So those are the two things that Paul is praying for
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.360]   in this one long run-on sentence,
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.360]   abounding love and persevering holiness.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   And there is a build-up and a moving towards
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:37.360]   the exaltation of Christ in this long prayer.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   But before I dive into the passage,
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.360]   I want to familiarize us a little bit with the Philippian church
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   so we understand where our similarities actually are.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.360]   So the Philippian church was indeed a good church.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   It was a healthy church.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   And the epistle to the Philippians is one of Paul's
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.360]   most uplifting letters among all the epistles.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.360]   But even in this healthy church,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.360]   even though it was a healthy church,
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.360]   it wasn't free of conflict.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.360]   And there were a few things happening internally in the church.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   So first, for whatever the reason,
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.360]   there appears to have been some grumblers in the congregation,
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.360]   some minor tensions among the members.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.360]   And we know this because Paul briefly addresses this
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.360]   in chapter 2, verses 14 to 15.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:32.360]   "Do all things without grumbling or disputing
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.360]   so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent."
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   And this is the second time the word "blameless" is found in Philippians.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   The word "blameless," some of you may have caught this,
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   was found in that prayer that I just read.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   "Holy people ought not to grumble," is what Paul is saying here.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.360]   Secondly, in this church, two prominent women
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.360]   have become so embroiled in some sort of disagreement
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.360]   that Paul has to publicly call them out by name,
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.360]   Euodia and Swintike.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.360]   They're not bad women.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.360]   They're not troublemakers.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   We are led to understand that they are both godly women
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.360]   who love the gospel, supported Paul's ministry,
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   but it appears that something has caused them to be divided.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   Philippians 4, 2 to 3,
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:32.360]   "I urge, Euodia, and I urge Swintike,
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.360]   to live in harmony in the Lord.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.360]   who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.360]   together with Clement, also, and the rest of my fellow workers
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.360]   whose names are in the book of life."
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.360]   So there were things happening in the church.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:57.360]   There were also real pressures and threats from outside as well.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.360]   As was typical in the climate of the times,
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   those outside of the church were hostile toward the cause of Christ.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   And we glean as much from what Paul writes elsewhere in the letter.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   So first, the Philippian church was located in a very Roman
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   and a very worldly society,
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   and the surrounding secular people's gods were their stomachs.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.360]   So they lived for their appetite.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   And everything that these people did was for pleasure
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.360]   and they acted upon instinct.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.360]   And of course, as is often the case,
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   there were people also trying to distort the gospel of Christ
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   with varying heresies.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   So in Philippi, one of these prominent groups
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.360]   were the men of the circumcision.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   We know them better as the Judaizers.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.360]   And they weren't the only ones threatening the church.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   Paul writes that the enemies of the cross of Christ were many.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.360]   So we know that there's some drama inside the church.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.360]   There were pressures coming from outside the church.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   And we know that when there's drama and brokenness and opposition,
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   a cooling of love often happens.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   Even at neutral, we wane, we drift, we lose interest.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   But when there's opposition, it kind of goes faster.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.360]   Honeymoons end.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.360]   Discontentment creeps in, and then reality sets in.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   So Paul prays this.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   Though it wasn't a perfect church, the Philippian church,
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.360]   nonetheless, was a healthy church and an already loving church.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   It was a very generous church, a very missions-minded church.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   So the letter to the Philippians is actually a thank-you card of sorts from Paul
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.360]   because they had sent him gifts,
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.360]   almost at the risk of the death of one of their members.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   So for the most part, the Philippian church was a very united church.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   So for this church, fully aware of all its imperfections, shortcomings, and challenges,
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   Paul prays that godly love would not just increase and flow like a rising river,
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   but that it would erupt and explode like a geyser.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   That's the feel of the wording.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:28.360]   And this overflowing love would not just aimlessly gush and spout all over the place,
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.360]   but it was to be directed, focused, and targeted,
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   hence this long, run-on sentence that we see in verse 9 through 11.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   So there is a grammatical flow of thought there.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:49.360]   And this overflowing, abounding love was to be rooted in Christ
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.360]   and routed toward Christ, who will one day come again in glory.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:02.360]   So the rest of Philippians, it gives us some hedges in better understanding this abounding love.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:10.360]   Everything about the Christian's love was to be Christ-centered before it was dispensed toward man.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:15.360]   Because compassion toward man without God is not love.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   So Christ-centered love, or the Christian love was to be Christ-centered before it was dispensed toward man.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:29.360]   So verses 9 through 11 and its surrounding verses teach us
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   that a Christ-centered, abounding love is rooted in Christ,
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:45.360]   filled with Christ until the day of Christ to the glory and praise of Christ.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:54.360]   I am saying Christ often here because Paul writes Christ often here in Philippians.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:48:00.360]   If you look at just the opening 11 verses of Philippians, Christ Jesus is mentioned seven times.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.360]   If you ever try to memorize a book, you're like, "Wow, Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus." It's again and again.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.360]   Seven times in the first 11 verses. You can go ahead and count it at home if you have some time.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:16.360]   The opening chapter of Philippians is extremely Christ-centric.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:26.360]   In fact, the entire epistle to the Philippians is one of the most Christ-centric letters of all of Paul's letters.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   In the book of Philippians, you'll notice the words Christ Jesus, Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ, Him, the Lord, repeated often.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:44.360]   There are 104 verses in Philippians, and I counted more than 52 mentions of Christ.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:50.360]   So in more than every other verse in the letter, there is a mention of Jesus Christ.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   So love that honors God and love that is to abound still more and more is first Christ-centered.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.360]   It is not produced through effort.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:10.360]   Abounding love is not produced by working harder.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:17.360]   And remember, Paul prays this. He doesn't command it.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   Christ-centeredness produces abounding love. They go hand in hand.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   And we will learn this morning that an explosion, an exponential increase in the believer's Christ-centered love is not only possible,
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   but it is to be expected and relentlessly pursued.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   It is to be expected and pursued.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   A love of fellow Christians is evidence of saving faith.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.360]   And our brother Miguel alluded to it.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   A love of fellow Christians is evidence of saving faith.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   1 John 3, 14 says that if anyone says, "I love God," but hates his brother, he's a liar.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:16.360]   And abounding love in you and me is not only to be expected, but to be relentlessly pursued as a characteristic of our lives.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:22.360]   And Paul, according to the will of God, prays for this on behalf of the Philippians.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.360]   And we can apply this prayer in our context today.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   That's a long introduction, and usually my introductions are a little shorter, but I needed to set it up.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.360]   So there's a flow to Paul's prayer.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.360]   There's a flow to Paul's argument and his logic.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:41.360]   There is a flow and a direction in this logic that is Christ-centered.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.360]   And that flow is upstream and unnatural.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:51.360]   The natural flow, remember, is that resolve weakens, love gets cold, and passions get numb.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.360]   But the supernatural flow is in the reverse.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:01.360]   The natural, unchristian man cannot love in the way that Paul is praying.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:09.360]   The natural man's love will never abound more and more, and there is no real knowledge, there is no discernment.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:15.360]   The natural man is just a creature of instinct, as we've learned in both 2 Peter and Jude.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:21.360]   But on behalf of the spiritual man, Paul prays to the Lord.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   So we're going to be looking at the elements of this prayer and the flow of this Christ-centered love.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:34.360]   First, a Christ-centered love is driven in a direction.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.360]   It's driven.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   Secondly, a Christ-centered love is discerning.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   And we're going to be spending the bulk of our time on those first 2 points.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.360]   It's driven and it's discerning.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   Third, Christ-centered love is devout, verse 10.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   It's devout.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:03.360]   Fourth, Christ-centered love is doxological, verse 11.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   It results in the glory and the praise of God.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   I actually had to just find a word that starts with D.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   But hopefully it helps you remember better.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   Christ-centered love is doxological.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   It results in the glory and the praise of God.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.360]   So here is the content of Paul's prayer.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:34.360]   He first prays at the Philippian church, their members, that their love abounds still more and more in a particular direction.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   It is driven.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.360]   And so I'm going to read verse 9 again.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:52.360]   I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:57.360]   So first point, a Christ-centered love is driven.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:05.360]   And by the grace of God, it's to be driven and directed towards a real knowledge and all discernment.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.360]   There are two words that are highlighted here.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.360]   The first is knowledge.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.360]   A Christ-centered love is driven toward knowledge.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:21.360]   It moves toward knowledge.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:29.360]   The knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, of course, can be applied here, but I don't believe that that's what Paul is referring to.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   There are two words in the Greek for knowledge.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:39.360]   Often in the Scriptures, the word for knowledge is oida, O-I-D-A, if you're taking notes.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   And that usually refers to an intellectual knowledge gained through some kind of a study.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:52.360]   It can also be used for like common sensical things of human experience.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   So in Philippians chapter 4, Paul writes that he oida knows how to get along with humble means, how to have an abundance.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.360]   He knows how to be content in every need and every situation, both in plenty and in want.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.360]   That's oida.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:25.360]   But here in chapter 1, verse 9, Paul uses the word epigonosis, which generally conveys the idea of a relational experiential knowledge.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.360]   It is interactive and it's a personal knowledge.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.360]   So I'm going to give you an example.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.360]   I oida know Billy Graham.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:40.360]   I oida know John Piper, C.S. Lewis.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   But I epigonosis know Peter Kim, Nate Kwok, and Mark Lim, who's over there.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.360]   You guys, are you understanding this?
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   Okay.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:55:04.360]   A Christ-centered love is driven toward an experiential full gnosis knowledge, but about what?
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:13.360]   And one of the reasons this verse doesn't stir us as it should is a lot of times we just read it without thinking through what this knowledge is.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   So what is Paul praying about for us to know?
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   And how is that related to an abounding love?
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:26.360]   And he's going to explain it in chapter 3.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:30.360]   Philippians chapter 3, verse 7 to 11.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   But whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:52.360]   More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of gnosis knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   And I count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ and may be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:27.360]   And I pay attention that I may gnosis know him and gnosis know the power of his resurrection and gnosis know the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   Paul considers all of his academic and his religious accolades as rubbish. Literally, it's like excrement. It's poop. It's dung.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.360]   All of that on his resume, it's dung.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.360]   What does Paul want to know?
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.360]   He wants to know Christ.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   He wants to know the power of Christ's resurrection.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   He wants to know the fellowship of Christ's sufferings.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:08.360]   He wants to grow in the knowledge of Christ's humiliation and death.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   He has academic oida knowledge. In fact, he pretty much has more oida knowledge than any of his readers.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:22.360]   And he lists them in the previous verses in chapter 3.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   But what Paul is driven to know experientially is Christ.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:41.360]   And what he's driven to know is Christ, the God who is love, and his sufferings which were compelled by that love.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:58:02.360]   Paul is zealous to gnosko know Christ who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a bond servant and being made in the likeness of men and being found in appearance as a man.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:07.360]   He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even on a cross.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   And this is the Christ Paul wants to know, a mocked, bloodied, beaten, and hanging on the cross Messiah.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   The humility of God who became man, Paul wants to know.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:36.360]   The perfect, sacrificial, pain-filled love of this perfect God is what Paul wants to know.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:46.360]   And he wants to understand the crucifixion and the suffering and the poverty of Christ.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:59.360]   In verse 5, right before this, Paul exhorts the Philippians to want that same real knowledge, to have that same attitude of Christ's here.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:12.360]   So this is not a deepening kind of a love, it is an emptying, a humiliating, and a sacrificial love.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   This is the knowledge that's supposed to be rooted in and resulting from their love, an intimate knowledge of the humiliation of Christ.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:34.360]   We cannot fully know the love of Christ without knowing the suffering and the intense loneliness of Christ.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:47.360]   And this Christ-centered, Christ-saturated love is what Paul is praying that the Philippians abound in still more and more.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:59.360]   When we pursue knowing God and knowing His heart, love cannot but be produced.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   In fact, love is the very first fruit mentioned as evidence of the Spirit's work.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:14.360]   But if we stop at only knowing a lot about God, pride puffs up.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:23.360]   If we stop at only knowing a lot about God, we get embittered when we aren't appreciated or noticed,
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.360]   when we are disrespected or when we are disagreed with.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:33.360]   Do you really want to know God?
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.360]   Do you want others to know God?
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:46.360]   Or are you satisfied with only knowing a lot about Him?
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   Because we cannot desire to know God and want to steer clear of any humiliation or daily cross-bearing.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   A wealth of simply knowing a lot about God cannot save us.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:11.360]   It will not change us.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:20.360]   All honeymoons in religiosity or in churchianity, sooner or later, comes to an end.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:34.360]   But the Christ-centered love of God will develop within us a longing which grows in intensity to understand the broken heart of God.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:41.360]   And that love, it cannot but abound still more and more.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:51.360]   So the real knowledge that Paul is referring to is in Christ and in His humiliation and in His sufferings.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:02:00.360]   It's the becoming like Christ in His death and in His emptying.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.360]   It is not just a deepening of love.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.360]   It's a sacrificial expending of it.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:18.360]   A false religion will point to a Christ who will primarily free us only from this world's suffering.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:28.360]   It will point to a Christianity that promotes safety and comfort and pride in morality.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   But Paul says in Philippians 3.10 that the gospel he is proclaiming as good news,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   it's fixated more on the resurrection from this life and not just an improvement in this life.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:03:03.360]   So our zeal has to be in knowing Him even and especially in the fellowship of His sufferings being conformed to His death.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.360]   It's not that appealing at first glance.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:14.360]   The natural man is repulsed by this.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:21.360]   And so Paul prays that the redeemed Christian not only has to pursue this knowledge but that he needs training.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.360]   He needs all discernment.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   So in addition to this knowledge, a Christ-centered love is driven towards all discernment.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.360]   And that brings us to our second point.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.360]   A Christ-centered love is discerning.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.360]   Philippians 1.9-11.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:50.360]   And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:57.360]   so that you may approve the things that are excellent.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:08.360]   So in addition to real knowledge, an element of the abounding of love ought also to produce like a wide net of discernment.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.360]   The word "all" is there in the Greek.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:17.360]   The NIV kind of translates that as like the depth of insight, depth of discernment.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.360]   So this word for discernment is unique.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.360]   It's only found here in the New Testament.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.360]   The King James Version translates it as like judgment.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:35.360]   But it's a word that means not just a distinguishing between like wise and foolish,
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.360]   but more so between what is true and what is counterfeit.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:46.360]   It doesn't just mean discernment wisdom-wise.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:53.360]   It's a discernment that enables a person to discern authenticity.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   And to help us understand this word, we actually have to look at verse 10, "to approve."
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:13.360]   So in the classical Greek, that word there for "approve" is usually used for the testing of a purity of metal, purity of coins, for their genuineness.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:18.360]   So it would be the modern-day equivalent of like checking for counterfeit bills.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:28.360]   Now, I don't remember exactly who told me this, but I have heard that bill testers, like people who make money, people who produce bills, okay,
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.360]   they require a certain degree of training.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:38.360]   But in their training, they don't worry too much about studying all the different kinds of counterfeits.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:42.360]   They spend the bulk of their time studying the real bills,
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:51.360]   so much so that when they are handed a counterfeit, they can spot it pretty quickly, even if they can't articulate why.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:06:01.360]   Not because they know or are experts in every kind of counterfeit that is out there, but because they are so familiar with the authentic.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:09.360]   They are so intimately familiar with the real and with the authentic that they can spot the fake and the counterfeit very quickly.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:23.360]   So a person who deeply understands the humility of Christ and the compassionate love of Christ can spot all counterfeit teachings.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:34.360]   He can usually discern and call out the almost true as heresy.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:40.360]   What Paul is saying about this abounding love is that it is not blind. Love is not blind.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:44.360]   Abounding love has both eyes wide open.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:52.360]   A Christ-like love not only knows and embraces Christ's humiliation, but is also very discerning.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:58.360]   And it's also very zealous for the truth and for holiness.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:14.360]   Abounding love hates sin, because it understands that the God of love hates sin.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:26.360]   The untrained eye may mistake the call to holy living as legalism.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:38.360]   The trained and discerning eye understands the call to holy living as the only appropriate response to amazing grace.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:48.360]   The trained eye can discern between what is actually gospel-powered, compassionate service to the poor,
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:55.360]   and distinguish that from man-centered, humanitarian effort.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   And because of his obsession with knowing Christ, Paul's been trained up in this discernment,
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:10.360]   so much so that when people are preaching the gospel, even from envy and strife to cause him affliction, it doesn't bother him.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.360]   That kind of stuff, he doesn't care.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:19.360]   He can still rejoice. He can rejoice because Christ is preached, even at his expense.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:31.360]   The two prominent women in this church are at odds. He has the discernment to know how to lead others to help them reconcile.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:39.360]   In his discernment, Paul also knows how to get riled up with holy anger. He knows when to be upset.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.360]   Paul doesn't get upset when he's personally maligned or attacked.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:50.360]   But he's riled up, though, when a false gospel threatens to infiltrate and corrupt the church.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:09:00.360]   Philippians 3, 2-3, "Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:09.360]   For we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh."
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   Some of the translations have exclamation marks after each of the beware statements to catch Paul's emotion.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.360]   Christ-centered love is discerning.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:31.360]   It knows when to fight, it knows how to fight, and it knows how to fight for and speak the truth.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:44.360]   And discernment trains a Christian to know how to speak the truth, not out of self-righteousness, but in an abundance of Christ-centered love.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:54.360]   A love that is focused on, and its goal is always the exaltation of Christ and the holiness of the believer.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   Philippians 1, 9-11, "And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.360]   so that you may approve the things that are excellent."
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:15.360]   The Apostle Paul praises with expectation that the Philippians will grow and abound in this discernment.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:22.360]   At the close of the letter, he tells them that once they've determined and approved of those things that are excellent,
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.360]   that they're supposed to mull over it again and again. They're supposed to obsess over it and dwell on it.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:38.360]   And this dwelling, this abiding, I believe, is the fuel to keep the abounding love growing in abundance.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   And I want to read Philippians 4, 8.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:53.360]   "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:11:02.360]   whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence, if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things."
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:09.360]   And as a Christian's abounding love grows in real gnosis, knowledge, and discernment,
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:15.360]   the meditation on these things leads to still more and more.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:21.360]   And one of the things that we will discern well as we draw nearer to Christ
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:33.360]   is that Christ, in His kindness and His grace, will gift His people not just with faith and belief,
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.360]   but a joy-filled participation in suffering.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:54.360]   Persecution and perhaps even martyrdom to the trained eye are gifts and privileges
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.360]   that have been granted to many believers in the history of the church.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.360]   The untrained eye will say, "Why is God doing this to me?"
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   The trained eye will say, "I consider this all joy."
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:19.360]   And it looks like the Philippians were given this wonderful gift of suffering.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:28.360]   Philippians 1, 29, "For to you it has been granted in joy for Christ's sake,
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:35.360]   not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake."
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:43.360]   For the Christian, as his Christ-centered love abounds still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:50.360]   he will learn to consider it all joy when he encounters various trials.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:56.360]   After all, Christ did not suffer and die to make us comfortable.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.360]   Amen?
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:08.360]   He suffered and died to reconcile us to God and to save our souls.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   He suffered and died to equip us to lead others to be reconciled to God and to save their souls.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:25.360]   Comfortable people are horrible evangelists.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:34.360]   Comfortable people grow cooler in love.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:43.360]   Christ did not die to make us comfortable.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:49.360]   And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.360]   so that you may approve the things that are excellent in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ,
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.360]   having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:09.360]   The third and fourth elements of the abounding Christ-centered love, I'm just going to combine to a single point and go over it pretty quickly.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.360]   They're not as difficult to understand, and we don't need to belabor every point.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.360]   I put them on the slide because that's a part of the thought flow, and some of you guys get annoyed when something's missing.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.360]   So I put it there.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:25.360]   Third, Christ-centered love is devout.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   And fourthly, a Christ-centered love is doxological.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.360]   A Christ-centered love is devout.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.360]   It's both sincere and blameless.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:49.360]   The work of Christ on the cross has made the believer blameless in standing and in position.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:58.360]   But it also continues to produce both a sincerity of heart and a blamelessness of deed if you are Christ-centered.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:07.360]   And the believer is filled with the fruit of righteousness simply as a gift of his faith, on the basis of his faith.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.360]   And we read about that earlier in Philippians 3.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   Not by works, not by obedience to any law or conformity to any church culture, but by faith.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:27.360]   He has been made righteous by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:39.360]   He has been made devout, and he is empowered to live a devout life, abounding in love, more and more until the day of Christ.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   And the world hates this.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:57.360]   One of our strongly recommended books that we almost want to force upon all our church members is R.C. Sproul's "The Holiness of God."
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:05.360]   And I'm going to share a quote that felt appropriate to share for today's passage, just in light of this point three.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:13.360]   "Holiness provokes hatred. The greater the holiness, the greater the human hostility toward it.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:24.360]   It seems insane. No man was ever more loving than Jesus Christ, yet even his love made people angry."
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.360]   A Christ-centered love is devout, it is holy.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:33.360]   And this holiness results in the praise and the glory of God.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.360]   It results in the exaltation of Christ.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:42.360]   And as I mentioned to you before, the exaltation of Christ is at the heart of Philippians.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:49.360]   "He who has once been humiliated will one day permanently be exalted."
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.360]   Philippians 2, 8-11.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:17:00.360]   "Being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:09.360]   For this reason also God highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   So that at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:27.360]   And that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:34.360]   That's what awaits us on the day of Christ.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:41.360]   Until the day of Christ, the love of the church grows and abounds.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   Until the day of Christ, the saints persevere in holiness.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:58.360]   And on that day, there is glory and there is praise lifted up from heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:07.360]   Every knee bows, every tongue confesses, and for all eternity, Christ the Lamb of God is highly exalted.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:17.360]   So while we live in this sin-tainted world and our temporarily broken realities,
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:25.360]   as we become more Christ-centered, we will understand what it means to join with Paul in saying,
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:32.360]   "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:42.360]   It sounds so nice, right, on a picture frame, but how many of you obsess over that and believe that?
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:53.360]   To live is Christ and His sufferings and the power of His resurrection, becoming like Him in His death,
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:59.360]   and to die is gain.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.360]   So what if I suffer?
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.360]   So what if we physically perish?
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.360]   Death isn't bad for the Christian.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.360]   It is good.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.360]   Death isn't just good, it's actually very much better, it says, right?
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.360]   It is better by far, the dynamic equivalents will say.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.360]   Death is gain.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:35.360]   So with the remaining time we have on earth, we will live to know Christ and to make Him known,
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:45.360]   and to love abundantly, and to minister to His people in our humiliation, in our suffering,
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   in our discomfort, in our misunderstood states, in our weakness.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:58.360]   And this love will abound more and more until the day of Christ.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:06.360]   1 Corinthians 2.9, "Just as it is written, 'Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:16.360]   and which have not entered the heart of man, all that God has prepared for those who love Him.'"
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:21.360]   Have you guys ever imagined what heaven is like?
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.360]   What do you picture when you think of heaven?
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:35.360]   There have been movies made on it, things are all white, right, and stuff, but what is it like?
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:44.360]   And I think part of it is because our imaginations are so tainted, like, we don't long for it as we should.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:50.360]   Whatever heaven is like, the Bible makes a couple things clear.
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:55.360]   No imperfect eye has ever beheld it.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:02.360]   No mind, no matter how creative, has ever accurately imagined it.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.360]   Not a one.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:14.360]   Every beautiful thing you, right now, can conjure up in your mind in trying to visualize heaven
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:21.360]   is nowhere near close to the new reality that awaits us.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:32.360]   For starters, we will see God face to face, sin free.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:35.360]   We will no longer be broken.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   We will no longer be sin corrupted.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:46.360]   Our ability to enjoy will be perfect.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:53.360]   We will never tire of anything.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:22:08.360]   The honeymoon will not just not end, it will get better and better and better for all eternity.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   And for that, by faith, we, whose citizenship is in heaven, eagerly await the Savior from there.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:32.360]   But while we eagerly wait, may our love abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   so that we can approve the things that are excellent,
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.360]   being filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ,
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:45.360]   to the glory and praise of God, until he returns.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:55.360]   And I want to close with Philippians 3, 18-21, to describe our current, already but not yet state.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:05.360]   For many walk, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ,
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:10.360]   whose end is destruction, whose God is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame,
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:14.360]   who set their minds on earthly things.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:24.360]   For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:35.360]   who will transform the body of our humiliated state into conformity with the body of his glory,
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:44.360]   by the exertion of the power that he has, even to subject all things to himself.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:52.360]   And he goes on to say in chapter 4, verse 1, "Therefore, my brothers, stand firm."
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:24:05.360]   May the Lord grant us abounding love and persevering holiness to his glory and for our joy.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:09.360]   Amen? Let's pray together.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:19.360]   Father, we are so limited.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:30.360]   And not only are we limited, we are proud, where we think that we can trust what we know.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:38.360]   But I pray, Father, for greater growth in humility, in brokenness, and in weakness,
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:45.360]   so that we will not resist your sanctifying power and your love.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:54.360]   Teach us how to love like you. Teach us how to grieve over sin.
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   Teach us how to hate it.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:09.360]   And Lord, move us to compassion, so that everyone may know that you are God, and that you are good.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.360]   Be gracious to us. I pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:18.360]   Church family, let's all stand together as we sing our closing praise.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:42.360]   One church, one faith, one in the praise.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   God and God alone.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:54.360]   One voice, one grace, one name that says,
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:01.360]   All praise to you belongs.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.360]   All praise to you belongs.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   We lift you high, high. God and God alone.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:18.360]   May it be louder, louder than any other song.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:24.360]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:31.360]   You are forever God and God alone.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:39.360]   Who else can wash us in the way?
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.360]   God and God alone.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:52.360]   Who else can raise us from the grave?
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:58.360]   All praise to you belongs. Jesus.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:03.360]   All praise to you belongs.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.360]   We lift you high, high. God and God alone.
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:15.360]   May it be louder, louder than any other song.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:21.360]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:28.360]   You are forever God and God alone.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:35.360]   What could separate us from this amazing love?
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.360]   What could stand greater?
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:45.360]   Our God, every knee will bow down.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:54.360]   What could separate us from this amazing love?
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.360]   What could stand greater?
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   Our God, every knee will bow down.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:12.360]   Oh, every knee will bow down.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   We lift you high, high. God and God alone.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:25.360]   May it be louder, louder than any other song.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:31.360]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:38.360]   We lift you high, high. God and God alone.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:45.360]   May it be louder, louder than any other song.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:51.360]   You are forever seated on your throne.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:59.360]   You are forever God and God alone.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:06.360]   Let's pray together.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.360]   Lord, we pray with the Apostle Paul
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:19.360]   that our love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and in all discernment
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.360]   so that we too may approve things that are excellent
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:29.360]   in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:35.360]   having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:40.360]   to your glory and to your praise.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:46.360]   May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and love of God the Father
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:51.360]   and fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with each and every one of us
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:57.360]   who abounds in love and perseveres in holiness until the day he returns.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360]   Hallelujah. Amen.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:09.360]   God sent his Son. They called him Jesus.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:19.360]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:30.360]   He lived and died to buy my heart and hand.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:40.360]   An empty grave is there to hold my Savior and land.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:50.360]   Because he lives, I confess tomorrow.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:31:00.360]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:10.360]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:17.360]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:22.360]   Let your kingdom come.
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:28.360]   Let your kingdom come.
