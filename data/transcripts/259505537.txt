[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   But again, please turn your Bible to Exodus, chapter 19.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.000]   We're going to be looking at verses 1 through 7, and then the rest of the chapter through
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   the sermon.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.120]   The Word of God reads it this way, and it says, "In the third month after the sons of
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.740]   Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.120]   of Sinai.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.980]   When they set out to Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai, encamped in the wilderness.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.960]   And there Israel camped in front of the mountain.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.480]   Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain, saying, 'Thus you
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.200]   shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel, "You yourselves have seen
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.440]   what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.660]   Now then, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.200]   own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is mine.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.360]   And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.340]   These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.'
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.120]   So Moses came, called the elders of the people, and set before them all the words which the
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.880]   Lord had commanded him."
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.000]   Verse 8 as well, "All the people answered together and said, 'All that the Lord has
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.720]   spoken we will do.'"
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.400]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.080]   Our Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.040]   God, we thank you for the truth of your word as it guides us, as it continues to convict
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.200]   us, but also to shape our mind and heart.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.880]   I ask that you would grant to us receptive hearts, fertile hearts, Lord, and a true hunger
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.800]   to know you, the God of the Scriptures.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.640]   We also want to pray for the pastors and those ministering at the retreat, and we also want
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.440]   to pray for all the members, Lord, praying, God, that you would grant to them a fruitful
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.680]   time of connecting, first and foremost, with you, but also in sweet fellowship with one
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.680]   another in your name.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680]   And Father God, it's in that name we pray.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.680]   Amen.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.040]   As we look at this passage, it's a familiar passage of the nation of Israel coming out
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.840]   of Egypt, brought to a place of worship at Mount Sinai.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.760]   Familiar passage, perhaps, for a lot of you.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.440]   For me, as I revisited this, I'm studying through the book of Exodus with the youth
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440]   group.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   I got reminded of a time when I got pulled out, but I got pulled out of school.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.720]   See, there was a time during high school when I was getting into a lot of trouble, and I
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.320]   share this a lot when I share my testimony.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.440]   I got into a whole lot of trouble, and so my parents did one of those intervention things,
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.040]   where basically, right in the middle of high school, they made me drop out of the school
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.200]   that I was in and transferred me into another school.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.360]   Now that seems fine, except that school that I was in, I had already built up friends ever
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.640]   since elementary school in that district, all the way up.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.920]   The school that I was in, it was a huge school with lots of resources, sports and all that.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.840]   The student body was well over 4,000 students.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.040]   The thing about it is, my little generation of high school between, I think it was like
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.080]   '96 or '97 to whenever, right, the four years there, that was a generation when every boy
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.320]   thought that it was cool to be a gangster.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.200]   Every little boy thought that it was cool to wear baggy pants, dye your hair, wear different
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.920]   earring studs and all that kind of stuff.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.080]   They would even make characters, like Looney Tunes characters, Bugs Bunny, the Tasmanian
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.320]   Devil, wear baggy pants, and it'd be on the shirt and things like that.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   It was ridiculous.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.880]   A very pitiful time in life.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.480]   Well, what ended up happening, my parents said, "We need to prevent you from going down
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.200]   this path."
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.760]   Every child at that time, not every child, but there was such a push and pressure to
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.240]   experiment with everything from the drugs to smoking to partying and getting into gangs.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.840]   My parents saw me just continuing to dive into that kind of scene.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.200]   So they pulled me out and of course, did I go quietly?
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.800]   No, I was kicking and screaming, complaining, crying, whatever it may be, and they put me
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.600]   in this small little school where the entire student body for the entire school was about
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   380.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.200]   And my graduating class with the seniors was only about 60 students.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   It was crazy.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.320]   It was night and day.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.280]   And the thing is, there was a part of me, because they did that to me, I was bitter
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   in my heart.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   "Why?
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.120]   Why would you do that right in the middle of high school, your formative years?"
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.120]   I'm not bitter right now.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.080]   I'm not bitter at them now.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.260]   But actually, that's the point I want to make is, rather than being bitter, I am so grateful.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.640]   Because for a parent to make that kind of decision, I'm guessing, and I'm pretty sure
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.560]   I'm right, it was incredibly hard.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.080]   Who wants to see their own child angry, kicking and screaming?
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.440]   And I experienced that when we try to do things for our own children that are good, but you
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.560]   see them so hurt by what you believe is to be their best interest.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.280]   It's hard.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.880]   The decision is incredibly difficult.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.920]   But as I see the actions of God in his deliverance, pulling the people out, I see the heart of
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.040]   an amazing, perfect parent, loving his children.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.760]   And that's what we want to see today, as God delivers a nation of Israel out of Egypt,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.480]   but also God gives what is known as a covenant at Sinai.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.280]   A covenant at Sinai.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.600]   So in looking at this, let's look at a little bit of the backstory of where we are.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.720]   We're here in chapter 19, but we have to look at the backstory.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.820]   Pretty much, we know that there has been an incredible deliverance as God performed miracles
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.000]   upon miracles in the land of Egypt.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.620]   These weren't just simple spankings, so to speak, disciplinary actions against Egypt.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.440]   These were quite cosmic miracles.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.000]   It began with Moses showing them the power by throwing a staff on the ground and causing
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.280]   it to become snake.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.720]   But then as you recall, God performed miracles such as making every source of water in the
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.600]   land of Egypt turn to blood, so that the animals in the river would die, so that there would
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.560]   be a great stench in the land and the people did not have water.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.520]   And the people were so desperate, they were digging in the dirt for water, only to find
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   nothing.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.360]   They were looking in their bases and their storage houses to find nothing.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.240]   It was devastating.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.440]   Now I'm not going to go through every single plague, but you know how it ramps up.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.960]   Everything from their cattle dying, to their own physical bodies being hurt by boils, to
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:43.240]   seeing hail and fire fall from the sky, and to seeing, ultimately, death riddle their
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.040]   country, their children dying all around.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.480]   And they say, "There was never such a cry in the land ever before."
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.400]   And that night when God killed the firstborn of all the Egyptians of the land.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.200]   So that was an incredible deliverance, and on top of that, they were walking out proudly
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.240]   through, you know, from the land of Egypt, going through the land, and when they hit
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.820]   the waters, God performed another miracle, so the story continues to go.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:16.080]   There was incredible, incredible, miraculous, cosmic deliverance.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.240]   The reason why I'm making much of it is because there's a but.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.080]   To the surprise of the Israelites, it's not what they expected.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.760]   I mean, they'd been traveling now three months, and those three months, do you presume were
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   easy?
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.960]   Of course it wasn't.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.200]   What's really interesting is that as soon as they come out, they see the difference,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.080]   and many other Israelites start complaining, "Oh, that we would go back to the land of
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   Egypt."
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.080]   Why would they say that?
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.120]   Well, let me show you some photos real fast.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:55.720]   The first photo I have here for you is just a little, you know, map of how Egypt was lavishly
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.800]   provided by the Nile.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.040]   There's a delta where there's rich, fertile ground.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.280]   There are animals, there's fishing, they have industry, they have transportation, and that's
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.400]   why Egypt was such a powerhouse of an empire in their day, okay?
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.320]   But then you look all around the right, and you see that little wedge of land?
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.360]   That's the Sinai Peninsula.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.280]   That's where the nation of Israel are going to spend the next 40 years.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:28.200]   What's really hilarious is it's just literally over that cross, but it's all desert.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.700]   There are five major deserts in that area.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.680]   As soon as they go over, in the next photo please, as soon as they go over, they're going
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.460]   to hit the wilderness of Shur, okay, immediately to the east of Egypt.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.600]   As they walk down towards Mount Sinai, they're going to hit the wilderness of Panan, and
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.160]   then they're going to hit the wilderness of Sinai, the Sin Desert, and if they go up,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.720]   which they're eventually going to do, they're going to hit the Zin Desert.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.000]   There's just desert and wilderness all around.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.520]   The immediate land they walk through for the last three months is called the wilderness
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.000]   of Shur.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.120]   The photo, even in modern day, looks bleak.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.440]   The next photo is this.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.560]   Imagine coming out and saying, "We're going to have an amazing deliverance by God," and
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.360]   as a million people walk, they see this.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.600]   You're probably thinking, "What?
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.160]   Are you serious?"
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.520]   And so you see how the emotion of the Israelites are probably quite up and down, as they anticipated
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.800]   the deliverance of God, being reminded that God had an amazing promise for them, just
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.480]   as He promised Abraham, their forefather, and yet to only walk into dry land.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.800]   They had no water for days, and then God provided.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.220]   They grumbled, complained, and then there was dust, and then there was heat, God provided,
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.360]   and now God brought them to this mountain.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:50.960]   Although by their human eyes, it looks bleak, the story has another but.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:10:00.040]   But God wanted to give them something amazing, and that something amazing is His promise.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.640]   In this background story, there's the great deliverance, there is, "But," this is not
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.480]   what they expected, but God was working to give them a great promise, according to who
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480]   He is.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   According to who He is.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.520]   So let's take a look at our passage and think about some of these promises that we're looking
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   at.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.720]   I'm going to start in verse 1 again, and then read through verse 4.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.040]   It says, "In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt,
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.080]   on the day they came into the wilderness of Sinai, when they set out from Rephidim, they
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.080]   came to the wilderness of Sinai, camped in the wilderness, and there Israel camped in
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.080]   front of the mountains."
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.400]   So you see the repetition of, "They're in the wilderness."
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.720]   Verse 3, "Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountains, saying,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.080]   'Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the sons of Israel, 'You yourselves
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.440]   have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on the eagle's wings, brought
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.520]   you to myself.'"
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.440]   Now I want to pause there.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:09.720]   Before we actually get to the now, then, and the promises, God definitely has a reminder.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.920]   And this first reminder is, look at what you have seen, which is the great work of God.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.800]   See what the Lord has done.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.560]   See what the Lord has done.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.000]   And that's in the passage, verse 3-4.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.160]   I want to remind us by review of the story of what God has done as He points it out.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.600]   So in the next slide, you're going to see in this verse, I want to highlight three elements
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.880]   of what He has done.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.160]   First – sorry, thank you.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:44.400]   First you see when He says this, "You have seen what I did to the Egyptians."
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:51.680]   What God has done to the Egyptians, again, are miraculous judgments, showing His power.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.840]   It wasn't just, "Okay, I want to teach you that you need to respect me, and therefore,"
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.080]   and then this, God meticulously destroyed every confidence they had in all of their
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.200]   idols.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.760]   When God gave those miracles of the Nile, the gnats, when God gave the miracles of the
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.420]   death of the cattle, when God gave the miracles of all the sun blackening so that there was
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.720]   pitch darkness, every one of those things was a direct attack on their confidence on
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.560]   Egyptian gods.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.320]   The Egyptians worshipped all these different idols that gave them provision, that gave
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.760]   them protection, that gave them sun and light and warmth.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.560]   God judged those things meticulously.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:41.240]   And it kind of shows, again, the kind of power of God that He exhibited.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:47.640]   But what's more, God says, "You have seen how I bore you on eagles' wings."
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.880]   What beautiful descriptive words that God uses.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.320]   And the thing is, they have experienced this.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.600]   They've gone through the land for three months.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.440]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.920]   How much clothes would you need to pack for a three-month journey?
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.320]   I went on missions where it was only three weeks, not three months, three weeks, and
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.240]   we had like immigration bags that were this big, right?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.600]   But the people, they didn't have clothes like that.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   What did God do?
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.680]   God told them, "Your clothes will not wear while you wander.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.800]   Your feet and your sandals will not wear."
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.320]   By the miracles of God and the loving grace of the Father, He actually provided for them
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.200]   even in their clothing.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.900]   He provided for them food.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.920]   He led them to plenty of water.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.900]   He led them by the light of fire.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.400]   He led them by the clouds so that they would be shaded.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.760]   He led them in meticulous care.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.880]   That is what He's talking about when He says, "I bore you on eagles' wings."
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:51.480]   The protection of this bird of power, of majesty, protecting its own nest, so to speak.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.480]   When it would have little birds that are babies and whatnot, they would fall and they would
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   need to learn.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.760]   They would actually pick up with its wings, providing for them in every step of the way.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.320]   It wasn't just through their wilderness.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.680]   It was all through the plagues.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.420]   It was all through the miracles.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.920]   You guys recall how the miracles would come.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:16.120]   For example, the hail would fall, but God would make a distinction so that no individual
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.080]   or flock of the Israelites would be harmed.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.000]   What a beautiful picture of the nurture and tender care of God.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.520]   He bore them on eagles' wings.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.040]   But what's more, He says this, "I brought you to myself.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.600]   I drew you close."
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.480]   God drew them to this mountain.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:44.640]   At this point, they should be completely floored and amazed at what God has done, especially
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.760]   Moses.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.000]   Moses has been here before.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.720]   Did you know that?
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   There's a passage.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.280]   I kind of skipped one of the slides there, so if you would please go back.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.160]   There's a passage in Exodus 3, verse 9.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.480]   The whole chapter is quite an amazing one.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.800]   If you recall, as Moses was in the wilderness shepherding his flock, he saw a strange sight,
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.480]   which was the burning bush.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.360]   That bush was on Mount Horeb.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.680]   What's really interesting is this, that as God told Moses and met him there and said,
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.160]   "I have seen the affliction of my people, and I'm going to come and deliver them," God
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.900]   actually gave him this promise.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.900]   Look at this.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.320]   "And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and have also seen
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.720]   the oppression which with the Egyptians oppressed them.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.280]   Come, I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.280]   out of Egypt."
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.240]   But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.240]   out of Egypt?"
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:49.080]   And he said, "But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.240]   sent you.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:58.360]   When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.440]   Did you know that?
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.760]   That when God initially met Moses and gave him that promise of deliverance, God physically
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.520]   showed him, "You are going to come here.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.920]   This is how sovereign I am.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:16.480]   You will come and worship, and that's going to be proof to you that I'm with you."
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.680]   Can you imagine then Moses going through all of that, all of his fear and anxiety, like,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.160]   "Can I really do this?
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.640]   You know what a bumbling idiot I am.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.200]   I'm not good with my words."
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:33.760]   But God, exhibiting his mighty hand, delivering them from the Egyptians, showing them that
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.440]   God has power, even judging the enemy so that they would be swallowed by the sea and they
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.480]   saw the bodies of the Egyptians, chariots and the horses all across the sand.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.000]   And then to come here to the mountain, and God saying, "Come worship."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.760]   See, by way of quick application for us, God is saying, "You have seen this."
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:04.240]   And for us, for us to grow in our Christianity and faith, we have to grow in appreciation
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.760]   for the beginning, the middle, and end of all that God is doing.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.600]   From the beginning of God's deliverance, away from the sins, away from the bondage, away
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:19.520]   from the pains that are there because of our sins, but also to the transformation, the
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:26.360]   comforting, the healing, the change that he provides, the strength and sustenance he provides,
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.960]   to ultimately bringing us and drawing us to sweet fellowship with him, that he would ultimately
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.880]   glorify us to see him face to face.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.080]   Every aspect of these things are things that we need to see, and the next challenge is
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.240]   this.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.200]   Do you personally see it as Moses would?
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.920]   See, I imagine that within the whole story, you have the perspective of Moses who's probably
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.480]   thinking like, "My mind is blown.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   We're here.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.480]   Look at us.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.520]   The impossible has happened.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:02.080]   Slaves oppressed by mighty men have come to worship God.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.760]   And exactly as he has said, we're here at this mountain."
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.440]   Moses has seen it.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.200]   But then there's maybe a perspective of a little child who lost all his friends and
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.840]   he left the comforts of Egypt or whatever it may be, and all he knows is he's walking
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.320]   along the side of some horse smelling all the debris, and they don't even have that
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.960]   much water, and they're just walking, and all he sees is wilderness, and all he's doing
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.880]   is following his parents.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.720]   That could be us.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.640]   Just following our parents to church, not really getting why we're doing this, feeling
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:41.280]   like I'm just giving up all my luxuries and pleasures and all the things I want to pursue.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:48.520]   Do you have this perspective of appreciation for the miracles God has performed by redeeming
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:54.800]   us, the great deliverance that God has granted to us as a gift to us?
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.280]   We need to see that for ourselves.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.000]   And that's the first challenge I want to give to you.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.160]   But again, we are wanting to say that as God is delivering them, this passage to me strikes
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:14.280]   me so deeply because God in His love is giving wonderful promises.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   What is He doing?
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   What He's doing is this, as the story continues.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:25.920]   I'm going to read verse 5 and 6 now, so please turn back to chapter 19, verse 5 and 6.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:32.560]   And He says, "Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.320]   shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.480]   And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.120]   These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel."
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.840]   What God is doing is He is covenanting with His people.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.800]   God covenanted with His people.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.760]   To me, that's quite astounding.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.160]   Now historically, you guys have probably heard what this covenant is.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.480]   This is commonly referred to as the Mosaic Covenant or commonly referred to as the Covenant
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   at Sinai.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.320]   Okay, Covenant at Sinai.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.840]   And in this covenant, many of us have learned these are the laws and regulation that God
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.320]   has given to mankind.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   True.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.960]   But there are also, there's curses.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.880]   There's warnings and curses for us so that if there is sin and disobedience to this law,
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.880]   then we are going to be judged.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   True.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.200]   There's this and more though.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.280]   I'm going to make the case right now that this covenant perhaps that we've always seen
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:44.040]   as this is in the Old Testament, it's behind us now, it was laws and regulations written
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:49.760]   on stone, effective for nothing, that kind of thing, that these words, this covenant
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.720]   is actually good.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.440]   This covenant comes from a good God.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.880]   So I'm going to make this case for you now.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:05.420]   First, this covenant is connected with the Abrahamic Covenant.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.640]   This covenant is connected with the Abrahamic Covenant.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.240]   What I mean by that is, this covenant and the Mosaic Covenant does not in any way contradict
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:20.200]   or compete or nullify the promises that God gave to His people.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.600]   God told Abraham, "I have chosen you."
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.740]   That choosing is not nullified.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.000]   God told Abraham, "I'm going to bless you and make you a great nation."
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   That is not nullified.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.760]   He said, "I'm going to bless you and I'm going to give you this land."
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760]   That's not nullified.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.440]   And then He says, "I'm going to bless you to bless everybody else."
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.880]   I'm going to use you as a blessing to the entire world.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.160]   That's not nullified.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:49.000]   As a matter of fact, this Mosaic Covenant is a step in fulfilling that covenant.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   It's connected.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.600]   The idea of possession, the kingdom, the nation, these are all reflections of the Abrahamic
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.480]   Covenant and those things do not contradict.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.120]   And so that's why in the book of Galatians chapter 3, even though Apostle Paul describes
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.480]   to us how we are no longer under this law, he tells us very clearly, the Mosaic Law,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:16.880]   neither does the New Covenant nullify the promises that God has given as a gift because
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:23.840]   they are truly promises conditioned upon nothing but Himself.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.840]   That's the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.480]   What's more, here's the important thing.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.800]   The covenant, the Mosaic Covenant, at which sometimes we have again relegated to the past
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.240]   Old Testament, which yes, it should, but sometimes we've seen as nothing more than curses and
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:46.520]   oppression, is actually good because in the description of the covenant, you see God giving
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.120]   His relational guidance.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.720]   You see God giving relationship guidelines, teaching them.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.880]   This is what I expect of you.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.120]   This is how you approach me.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.080]   This is what I purpose for you.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.800]   These are my desires for you.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.560]   I mean, you don't just do that with anybody.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.160]   What would cause God to take these individuals who were slaves, who were grumbling, who didn't
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.400]   want to come out, and then covenant with them?
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.800]   That's His love.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.200]   These things come out from His love.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.880]   Now at this point, I do want to talk about the content of the covenant.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.680]   So point number four, if you would go to the contents of the covenant, I mentioned before
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:38.440]   the first that there are laws and instructions within this covenant.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.040]   I am not going to go through every single one of them because it's huge.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.680]   The book of Exodus is really funny because sometimes we see it as like, oh yeah, the
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.040]   narrative story of the deliverance and stuff, but actually the vast bulk of the book of
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.160]   Exodus, the narrative stands still at the mountain.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:01.040]   Everything from chapter 19 all the way to chapter 32-ish, it's all regulation.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.440]   Regulations about the tabernacle and how it's supposed to be built, regulations about what
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.000]   the priests are supposed to do, regulations about how people are supposed to treat each
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   other, property rights, all kinds of different laws and regulations.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.880]   Secondly, the Mosaic covenant includes curses and warnings.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.880]   It does give those fearsome, fearsome warnings.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.400]   If you transgress my law, I will break out upon you and kill you.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.720]   That's pretty much how it comes off.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.280]   But here's the thing.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.960]   I am making a case that the law of God, even in the Mosaic covenant, is good.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   Why?
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.560]   Because if you take a case example of one of these warnings, chapter 20 verse 20 says
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.560]   this.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.560]   Next slide please.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.680]   Chapter 20 says, "Moses said to the people, 'Do not be afraid, for God has come in order
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   to test you, in order that the fear of him may remain on you, so that you may not sin.'"
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.120]   God has intentionality and purpose to preserve you from sin, to preserve the people, the
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.840]   nation of Israel from sin.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:12.360]   And in that being the case, this was not just some military officer saying, "Jump, get up,
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.800]   get down, pushups, so that you know I'm in authority.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   Do it."
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   No, that's not the way that this is coming off.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.880]   This is coming off, again, eagle's wings picture, "I am protecting you from your own sin."
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.920]   Right?
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:32.360]   Now moving forward to the promises that are actually contained within this passage.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:37.880]   Look again at your Bibles at verse 5 through 6 and let's take a look at the promises that
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.380]   are there.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:47.420]   He says, "If you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:52.500]   own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is mine."
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.200]   Here's the very first.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.780]   The very first promise is that they are going to be his possession.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.480]   If you're working out of the ESV, it's going to say, "You are my treasured possession."
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.620]   It's really interesting that you have these two nuances.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.980]   NSV saying, "You're my own."
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.380]   ESV saying, "You're treasured."
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:17.140]   The reason why is because this term has been used in different contexts through the Bible.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.980]   Does it mean treasure?
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.060]   Absolutely.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:24.300]   King David would actually use this word to talk about his literal gold, silver, and the
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.180]   mass of wealth he has.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.540]   It is treasure.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.400]   However, the nuance is this.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:37.380]   It is not just general riches, but it is a particular, specific kind of possession.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.020]   Almost as to say, "This is my precious treasure.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.760]   This is my special treasure.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.840]   The world is mine and it's all mine, but you will be my own."
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   You see that?
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:52.260]   What a beautiful picture of how God's intent is being revealed.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.000]   This is God's promise to them.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   It's a promise.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   "You will be."
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.560]   What's more, he says in the next portion of the passage as we look, he says in verse
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:08.200]   6, "You shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation."
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.880]   A kingdom and priests and a holy nation.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:17.480]   Now, that might not sound like a whole lot to us just because I'm not a priest, but to
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:26.680]   them it's an incredible calling, a special purpose, a special kind of identity as a nation.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.440]   I will argue that in our generation, we too struggle with this exact same thing.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.120]   Do we not struggle with trying to find purpose?
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.200]   Do we not struggle with trying to find identity?
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.160]   Of course we do.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.800]   We have so many people, I talk to people who perhaps are in certain jobs where it seems
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.480]   repetitive, and we wrestle with that all the time.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.160]   It's because if yesterday is the same, today is the same, tomorrow is the same, you sit
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.800]   there and you end up thinking, "What's the purpose?
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   Why?
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   What am I doing?"
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   Every time I talk to an individual, sometimes, sometimes it's like the regular conversation
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.320]   is, "I'm looking for another job."
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.320]   "Oh, really?
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   You had a pretty decent job."
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.680]   It's like, "No, I'm looking for something else."
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.280]   This is the regular pattern of conversation.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.920]   Or they try to find meaning in their work and they're thinking, "Am I doing something
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.120]   worthwhile?"
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.520]   We all struggle with this.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:28.160]   God has promised them a unique place, serving Him, serving His kingdom, having an identity
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.840]   and value because God has placed them there and consecrated them to who?
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.840]   To Himself.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.600]   He's brought them near.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.960]   And so I want to inspire you for us, these promises to us even in the New Testament,
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:47.520]   these are the very things we long for, to experience that special connection with God,
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:53.600]   for to hear His words that He loves us, and therefore to be His possession, to be useful
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.280]   in His kingdom, to serve Him, to actually have a worthwhile sense.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:06.360]   God has given me the privilege to serve something eternal.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.500]   Did you know that all of this is contained in the Mosaic Law?
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.120]   So by way of application, I want to inspire you to have great gratitude for God through
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.680]   the Mosaic Law.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.800]   That which perhaps again, maybe you haven't, but for me I felt like the way I read the
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.120]   Mosaic Law always was, "That's the Mosaic Law, uh-uh, because that's legalism, and this
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.200]   is grace."
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:37.840]   And then you realize, God is gracious and so His covenant is chock full of grace.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.920]   Even this conditional covenant where He does demand obedience, He does demand keeping the
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:49.760]   covenant, and He demands faithfulness to Him, but even within it, there is grace to be found.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.960]   And I want to inspire us by way of application to be grateful for that.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.080]   The way I want to inspire us is by asking this question.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.000]   I'm making the case the covenant is good, and as we saw the details, what does it reveal
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.700]   about God's good nature?
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.920]   What does it reveal about God?
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.560]   Let me ask you in another way.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.880]   Writing down the things about His deliverance and the things about His promise, what kind
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.600]   of individual do you know who protects, who has a heart to protect from oppression, who
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.720]   has a heart to protect from wear and tear, who has a heart to protect from the elements
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.440]   of the wilderness?
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.760]   What kind of individual do you know who desires to carry the young on their wings?
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.920]   What kind of individual do you know who more than is willing to bring people close who
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:42.800]   are dirty, who are slaves and who walked in the dirt for months?
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:49.200]   What kind of individual do you know who treasures and sees the little ones as precious?
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.240]   What kind of one do you know who tries to teach fear so that they could prevent harm
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.300]   and destruction?
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.640]   What individual do you know who is desiring to instruct?
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.920]   What is motivating God to instruct these individuals and give them these laws?
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.440]   What kind of individual do you know who is giving wisdom, relational wisdom, and teaching
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:14.000]   for the future how to receive the next stage of their lives?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.720]   And if you said, "A good parent," you're absolutely right.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:25.960]   The laws of God reveal that our God is the perfect parent.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:32.760]   God has loved His people as the perfect Father, caring for them from beginning to end.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.360]   Every aspect of their journey, every aspect of their deliverance, every aspect of their
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.600]   future.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:44.960]   And this law that God has given in the Mosaic Covenant is an expression of that.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.960]   Is God required to give these people this law?
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.400]   Absolutely not.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.440]   Is God required to give these people these promises?
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.520]   Absolutely not.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:32:01.160]   What kind of individual, what kind of individual would continue to guide, instruct, and do
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   things for spoiled children who kick and scream and say, "I don't want to come"?
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.800]   And that's why I thought of my parents.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.920]   Good fatherhood.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.680]   How difficult it is to try and drag your child.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.080]   How difficult it is to see your child upset.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.880]   But God is the perfect Father.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.400]   God has His desire set on them for their good.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:35.000]   And so here and now He gives them this law to promise them, to promise them and to love
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   them.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.160]   This is our God.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.960]   I want to say this.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:46.140]   If ever you thought that at any moment in all of history that salvation was by the work
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.360]   of man, it has never been.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:55.320]   There is an element to which there is a unilateral nature to every covenant seen in the Bible.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.760]   Yes, the Mosaic Covenant was conditional.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   It says "if."
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.600]   There's a fat "if."
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.280]   If you keep my covenants.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.800]   But there's an element to which every covenant is still nonetheless unilateral, completely
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.240]   unconditional.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.640]   Why?
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:15.560]   Because it comes from an unconditional Father who loves this deeply.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:21.840]   It comes from God who's so good and therefore His laws are good.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.140]   His laws are absolutely good.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.080]   He is guiding them, instructing them, restraining them from sin.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.620]   And look at what He's done.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:39.060]   Have you personally seen God's, not just deliverance from bad stuff, but God's loving, fatherly
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.220]   care in your life?
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.380]   Can you testify to that?
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.940]   Have you seen it for yourself?
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.340]   I encourage you.
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.100]   It's the best thing.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.380]   Now going to point number five.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.900]   Point number five, so then, why is the law still seen as a curse?
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.940]   Why does the New Testament talk about it that way?
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.160]   Why do we typically see the law as oppressive?
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.860]   Why does the scripture talk about it that way, that we are under the captivity of the
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.420]   law?
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.100]   Make sense of this dilemma and paradox.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.860]   You're saying God's law is good.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:17.700]   It comes from a good God and He is pouring out His love and yet when we read it in the
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:26.660]   New Testament, it's like, "Do away with it!" because it's captivate, as in the bad sense.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.660]   It's slavery.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.660]   Why?
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.140]   Well, let's take a look.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:36.200]   One of the first passages I want to share with you is Galatians chapter three.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.780]   In your own time, please read the whole chapter because it's going to answer for you what
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.580]   is the purpose of the law.
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.460]   But for the sake of time, I want to read this little section.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:49.900]   It says, "For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written,
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.340]   'Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.020]   and do them.'
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:03.260]   Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for the righteous shall
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.700]   live by faith.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:09.140]   But the law is not of faith, rather the one who does them shall live by them.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.860]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:19.980]   So yes, most certainly, the law, according to the Mosaic Covenant, had curses.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.380]   The law had demands and expectations.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.500]   The problem was it demanded perfection.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.420]   That if you were to live by it, you would have to live by it completely.
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.600]   You see that?
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.540]   The law demanded that kind of perfection.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:41.820]   What's more, later in that same chapter, it's going to describe to us that the law is not
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.820]   opposed or will nullify the promises of the covenants.
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:52.140]   The law is stipulations, commands, and expectations, but it does not nullify the promises.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:57.140]   And then lastly, in Galatians, it teaches us that the law is your tutor, teaching you
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:01.460]   and guiding you and preparing you for Christ, instructing you.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.340]   That's the purpose of the law.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.260]   But in other passes, I want to go with you to talk about this paradox.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:13.220]   So the law is good, the law in many ways is perfect, and yet it's a curse to me.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.220]   Why?
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:19.060]   Please turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 7, verse 4 through 14.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.660]   It's going to be a lengthy segment, but it's worthwhile for us to read it.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.900]   So please go in your Bibles to Romans chapter 7, verse 4 through 14.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.980]   And we're going to walk down that passage step by step.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:35.100]   Good, it's there for us in terms of the points.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:41.540]   So again, Romans chapter 7, Apostle Paul is going to talk about the law, the law of God.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:46.380]   And this is what he's going to say starting Romans 7, verse 4.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:52.100]   "Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:57.100]   that you may belong to one another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.640]   that we may bear fruit for God.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.060]   For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions aroused by the law were at
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.580]   work in our members to bear fruit for death.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.380]   But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive."
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.380]   So yes, does it hold us captive?
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.380]   Yes.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:20.940]   "So that we serve in a new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code."
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:26.540]   So the law, it did hold us captive, and it was a written code of God.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.920]   But furthermore, verse 7, "What then shall we say?
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.780]   That the law is sin?"
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.300]   That's an important question.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.520]   And he answers, "By no means.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.100]   Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:45.740]   For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, 'You shall not covet.'
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:52.740]   But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness."
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.820]   So we see what the law has done.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:38:00.140]   The law has aroused in us what our hearts contain.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.140]   We're there thinking everything is fine.
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.580]   We're there living our lives.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:10.060]   And the law imposes upon us a certain standard and pressure, and the sin comes out.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.540]   What's more, it says, "For apart from the law, sin lies dead.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.020]   I was once alive apart from the law.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.080]   But when the commandment came, sin came alive, and I died.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.860]   The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me."
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.340]   So there is our paradox, rephrased by Apostle Paul.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:34.900]   This Word of God, the law, was intent actually on promises of life.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.820]   But it proved to be deadly to you.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.340]   Why, Paul?
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.260]   Why is it deadly to me?
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:45.940]   Why is a law that comes from a good God deadly to me?
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:51.780]   Verse 11, "Because sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.340]   through it killed me.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:57.900]   So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.300]   Did that which is good then bring death to me?
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.660]   By no means.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:08.620]   It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.740]   to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:19.860]   For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh sold under sin."
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.660]   See the difference there?
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.420]   There is an immense problem.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.420]   We see the goodness of God.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.580]   We see the goodness of His Word.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.300]   He is a loving, perfect Father up here.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:37.340]   But when the Word comes, it not only reveals to us this perfect God, when the Word comes
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:48.140]   it reveals to us this sinner and how thoroughly sinful he is, how thoroughly wretched I am.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:53.140]   There is a problem of the massive divide, which is our next point.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.140]   There is a massive divide then between us and God.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:03.980]   The problem is that when the sinner is confronted with this perfect Father, there is doom.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:09.740]   And when this sinner then is confronted with this perfect Father's law, there is doom.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.020]   That's why it's oppressive.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.380]   That's why it's captivating.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:19.180]   That's why there feels to be no freedom, because of the great massive divide.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:28.780]   So the story in the book of Exodus is interesting, because God has drawn them near by delivering
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.980]   them out, guiding them through the wilderness, bringing them to a point of promise at the
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.980]   mountain.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:40.740]   And yet, they're so far.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.060]   They're so far.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.140]   They're so close and yet so far.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.140]   God is eminent.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.140]   He is there.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:49.020]   He is ready to deliver, and yet He is transcendent.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.700]   And so everything about that screams, "You can't come to Him."
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.900]   And that's actually how the story goes.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.500]   If you turn back into your Bibles at chapter 19, I'm going to start reading from verse
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.660]   7, and look at how the story goes.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:09.340]   That God is beginning to give the Mosaic Covenant with His promise of the treasure of possession
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:14.100]   of who they will be, the greatest title basically that we can afford.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:20.340]   We would be a priesthood, right, of kingdom of priests and a holy nation unto Him.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.060]   And yet look what He says, verse 7.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.420]   So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all the words which
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.860]   the Lord had commanded him.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:35.220]   And all the people answered together and said, "All that the Lord has spoken we shall do."
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.620]   And Moses brought back the words of the people to the Lord.
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:42.700]   And the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.460]   people may hear when I speak with you and may believe in you forever."
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.620]   Then Moses told the words of the people to the Lord.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.780]   So you see what he's doing.
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.780]   He's running back and forth, up and down the mountain to mediate for the people.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:56.780]   Verse 10.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.300]   "The Lord also said to Moses, 'Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.140]   let them wash their garments.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.820]   Let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.500]   Sinai and the sight of all the people.'"
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.700]   But look at this, verse 12.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:17.340]   "You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, 'Beware that you do not go up to the
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.860]   mountain or touch even the border of it.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.500]   Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.140]   Whether beast or man, he shall not live.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:34.740]   When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up towards the mountain.'
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.220]   So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people, and they
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.580]   washed their garments.
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.140]   He said to the people, 'Be ready for the third day.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.340]   Do not even go near a woman.'
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.500]   For it came about on the third day when it was morning that there was thunder, lightning
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.420]   flashes and thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:59.660]   the people who were in the camp trembled.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.740]   And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.740]   the mountain.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:10.380]   Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the Lord descended upon it in fire.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:16.220]   Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:20.500]   When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.940]   him with thunder.
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.020]   The Lord came down on Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain, and the Lord called Moses
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.580]   on top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:34.660]   Then the Lord spoke to Moses, 'Go down, warn the people, so that they do not break
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:38.020]   through the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.180]   Also let the priests who come near to the Lord consecrate themselves, or else the Lord
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.020]   will break out against them.'
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.580]   Moses said to the Lord, 'The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you have warned
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.740]   us, saying, "Set bounds about the mountain and consecrate it."'
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:56.980]   Then the Lord said to him, 'Go down and come up again, you and Aaron with you, but
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.580]   do not let the priests of the people break through to come upon the Lord, or he will
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.380]   break forth upon them.'
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.140]   So Moses went down to the people and told them.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.460]   Then God spoke all these words, saying, 'I am the Lord your God, who brought you out
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.220]   of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:16.780]   You shall have no other gods before me.'"
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:22.300]   That lengthy scripture I read to you because I want to have in our minds this incredible
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.980]   paradox that we've been grappling with as we're talking about maybe our notions of the
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.220]   Old Testament, the notions of the Mosaic Covenant, that it's good, but there's this incredible
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.060]   paradox, but we're so far.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.340]   Did you know that when the people received the gracious Ten Commandments by which they
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:44.340]   lived, they received it in absolute terror?
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:49.420]   They were so afraid, the people kept crying out to Moses, 'Moses, Moses, you speak to
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:54.300]   us, but don't let this god speak to us, or we're going to die.'
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.100]   I want you to imagine coming into this service.
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.060]   You walk in through the doors, and for us, we have nice people saying, 'Hi, welcome.
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.060]   Is this your first time?'
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.740]   You know, 'No, it's my fifth,' or something, whatever it may be.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:11.060]   But instead, rather than seeing nice people with smiles, you see people in military fatigue.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.660]   They have guns on them.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.660]   They have helmets on.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.620]   And then they hand to you a helmet and say, 'You better wear this.'
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:22.420]   You go to your seats, and rather than seeing Bibles under your chair, you see Kevlar vests.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.980]   You see yellow tape all around that says, 'Caution, caution,' like this was some homicide
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.460]   scene.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.000]   Why?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.900]   Because there's potential death in the moment of their worship.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.900]   God is not safe, but is incredibly dangerous.
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:43.580]   Everything about this scene screams, 'There is such distance that you cannot come.'
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:49.700]   Everything, everything from the mediation of Moses as he goes up and down and up and
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.700]   down.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.260]   If you study it, he goes up and down multiple times.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:59.300]   And as you guys know, the people, they say, 'Yes, of course we'll obey.'
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.160]   But no, they don't.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:06.220]   As soon as Moses comes down with tablets in chapter 32, what does he see?
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.260]   A golden calf?
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.260]   Are you serious?
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.820]   And he throws the tablets on the floor and the ground breaks open.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.580]   Bunch of people die, and what happens?
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.900]   Moses goes up to the mountain again to mediate.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.700]   'Lord, do not destroy these people.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.660]   I pray you have mercy.'
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.660]   God writes a new set of commandment tablets and he goes down to renew the covenant.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.900]   Moses goes up and down and up and down.
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.100]   His mediation, you know what that tells us?
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.420]   You're so far.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.060]   You're so close, but you're so far.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.020]   The dense cloud covering his glory, you're so far.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.940]   The barrier all around the mountain that no man shall cross, you're so far.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:49.580]   The penalty of death when you cross this boundary, even if you're an animal, you're so far.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.620]   The volcano, right?
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:56.700]   The thunder, the lightning, the trembling, the earthquakes all telling you, you're so
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.900]   far.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:06.700]   This is an incredibly intense scene of Scripture which leaves us with our hands in the air
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:11.420]   saying, 'What do we do?
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:16.500]   What can we do if there is such a massive divide?
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:21.020]   What can we do if the presence of God is so deadly to me?
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.500]   What do I do?
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:28.100]   He just demanded faithfulness, but I'm going to die if I get close.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.500]   What do I do?'
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.460]   And that is the most important question today.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:40.060]   I would like to speak to anybody who is in this room who is not a Christian.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.940]   This is an immense question for you.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:50.220]   God has every right to demand of you holiness and righteousness, even if you have no power
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.220]   to do it.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:56.540]   And God has every right to judge you for every failure to obey.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.060]   Why?
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.860]   Because God is God and He is King.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:04.780]   His reign and authority does not stop in the prison and His reign and authority does not
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.260]   stop anywhere.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.820]   God has every right to demand righteousness from everyone, even from unsaved sinners.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:19.500]   But the question is, then what do you do?
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:26.820]   And if you're thinking, 'There's nothing,' then amen, you're absolutely right.
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:31.980]   It is absolutely impossible for a man to scale this mountain.
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:36.620]   It is an absolute impossibility for a man to cross this boundary.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:43.060]   It is an absolute impossibility for a man to change who he is in his sin and remove
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:48.180]   his flesh, to remove his depravity.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.220]   So what do you do?
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.380]   And this is where we come.
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.900]   This is where we come to God and say, 'God, because I cannot, You must.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.820]   You must draw me to Your mountain.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.700]   You must draw me to Your presence.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.540]   You must forgive my sin.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.660]   You must change me.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.840]   You must sanctify me.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.100]   You must give me new heart.'
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.900]   And I want to give you this promise.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.980]   When God promises you will be my treasured possession, God is promising you that should
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:23.860]   you believe in His Son, whom He laid down as the sacrifice to do all that for you, to
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:29.100]   absolutely forgive you, to change you, to cause you to be holy, His promise is there
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.100]   for you.
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:35.060]   Should you come to Him, God will do it for you.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.660]   That is the essence of the Christian gospel.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:42.300]   We come to the end of ourselves, come to the mountain, and we realize, 'I'm so close, but
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:45.320]   I'm so far.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.940]   And from here, I can go no further on my own.'
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.380]   And this is where the offer of Christ comes.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:58.420]   What the law could not do, what Moses could not do in his mediation, Christ has done for
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.420]   you.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.300]   Christ has done for you.
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.020]   Believe on the name of Jesus Christ and come to Him.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:12.620]   But I also want to speak to all of you, brothers and sisters who regularly wrestle with sin.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:13.620]   We all do.
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.300]   The Bible says we fall in many ways.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:21.380]   We struggle in many ways of the mind, of the heart, of the action, of our desires.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:26.260]   In so many ways, willfully, we sin.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:30.780]   Brothers and sisters, what do you do with that sin?
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:36.540]   Can I ask you, for those of you who are Christians, do you feel like this?
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.340]   Do you feel close yet so far?
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.780]   Do you feel like you've come to this strange mountain where there's clouds, smoke, and
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.020]   a distance between you and your Father?
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:53.900]   I want to remind you today that the only way for us to deal with our sin is through the
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.300]   mediation of Christ.
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.580]   That's how we did it at first, and that's how you're going to do it the rest of your
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.700]   life.
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:07.060]   There is no sin you're going to overcome because you say, 'Well, I will do it.'
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.060]   But you haven't.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.140]   'Well, I'm going to run away and hide.'
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:11.300]   You're not going to be able to.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.740]   'Well, I'm going to try better.'
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.900]   No, you're not.
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:21.500]   The sin that exists in our lives, we come by the name of Christ, through the mediation
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.140]   of our perfect priest, of our mediator, Jesus Christ.
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.540]   Lord, I come to you.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:34.660]   Now, the difference, though, the difference, though, is stellar because the Scripture teaches
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:41.820]   us when we are in Jesus Christ, he does not guide us through the wilderness to the mountain
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:47.860]   and an inanimate, scary figure and representation of how holy God is.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:54.140]   Rather, Scripture teaches us that we come completely into his presence.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:57.940]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 18 says this, "For you do not come to a mountain that can be
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:58.940]   touched.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:04.300]   You do not come to a mountain that is a blazing fire, to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:08.580]   and to the blast of trumpets and the sound of words, which sound as such that those who
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.620]   heard begged that no further words be spoken to them.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.580]   For they could not bear the command, 'If even a beast touches the mountain, it will
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.420]   be stoned.'
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:27.180]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, 'I am full of fear and trembling, but you,
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:31.780]   for those of you who are in Christ, you have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:37.020]   God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly of the
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:41.940]   church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, to the
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:49.060]   spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant.'"
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:51.820]   That's Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.060]   To make that all kind of wrap up and make sense for you and to close this off, this
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.180]   is what I want to say.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:01.180]   For every Christian, you are going to feel this temptation when you sin to feel like
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.260]   you're coming to Mount Zion fearful.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.180]   And you're going to react in multiple ways, whether it's blame, "Oh man, I sinned because
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.180]   of that."
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.100]   Whether it's running away and hiding, whether it's distinguishing yourself, whether it's
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.340]   hardening your heart.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:18.100]   But the challenge is this, do not fear.
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:19.180]   Why?
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:25.140]   Because although God is still the same holy God as seen on that Mount Sinai, this God
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.140]   is your Father.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.420]   And He's loved you from beginning to end.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:33.820]   And this good Father, when you come in repentance and you come in the name of Jesus, is not
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:37.340]   going to penalize you with this wrap.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:44.940]   He's going to give you forgiveness and grace upon grace as He did from the days of Abraham.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.100]   Abraham and Moses are indebted to Christ.
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.380]   Abraham and Moses are thankful in their hearts.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.620]   Why?
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:57.020]   Because all of the Father's love come to a pinnacle in Christ.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:01.700]   And the challenge for you every day, come to the Lord Jesus.
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:11.540]   Let's pray.
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:18.380]   Heavenly Father, we do want to thank you, God, that you have revealed yourself as the
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.060]   most faithful, loving God.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:27.780]   A Father who is perfect in the way that you discipline, in the way that you teach, in
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.260]   the way that you instruct your children.
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.460]   For that, God, we want to thank you so much.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:37.500]   And I pray, Lord, you would teach us what it means to love you as our Father.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:43.260]   God, help us not to miss the point of your covenants, that God, you wanted to covenant
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:48.580]   yourself and be in a relationship with these people, that you wanted to share and express
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.340]   your love with them.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:55.900]   And I pray, Father God, that for every single person here, as we've heard these words, we
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.340]   would long to experience that with you.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.700]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray.
