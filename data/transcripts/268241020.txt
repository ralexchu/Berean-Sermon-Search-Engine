[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   So I want to start by sharing a passage in Deuteronomy 23, 13, 14.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560]   It says, "Because the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.020]   to give up your enemies before you, therefore your camp must be holy so that he may not
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.800]   see anything indecent among you and turn away from you."
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.960]   So God made it very clear that he not only wanted the individuals in the camp to be holy,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.440]   but the camp itself to be holy.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.820]   So again, we see the same thing in the New Testament where God is rebuking the Corinthians
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.540]   church and saying, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God?"
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.760]   And whatever you do to defile the temple, it says that it is like you're defiling God
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.760]   himself.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.820]   It's blasphemy against God.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.040]   That's how sacred God sees the church, and that's how God saw the sacred assembly of
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.800]   the Israelites.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.160]   The reason why I share all of this is because leprosy was a disease that not only affected
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.040]   that individual, but it affected the community.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.680]   So everything about how to deal with this skin disease was to protect not only that
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.640]   person or to heal that person, but the community itself.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.360]   And ultimately, it's going to point to something very meaningful in the gospel.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.920]   So my approach today in chapter 13 is not to go into intricate details of the medical
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.000]   facts and what it points to.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.080]   Is this really this disease of leprosy, the Hansen disease, or is this pointing to something
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.080]   else?
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.240]   We can get into all of these arguments, but in the end, I think that's an unfruitful discussion.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.760]   We can know all of that and then just say, "Oh, okay, that's what it means."
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.400]   But what does this ultimately point to?
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.440]   The Hebrew word that's translated leprosy in Leviticus 13-15, it's not specifically
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.160]   just limited to what we know today about the disease of leprosy.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.120]   It definitely includes that disease, but it's not limited to that.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.720]   So it points to all kinds of various skin diseases.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.200]   Now if you're from the medical community and you know all the facts and all the biological
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.280]   things that happens in leprosy, you may read all these things and maybe it would make more
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.680]   sense to you.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.080]   But for most of us, all of these things are going to bleed in and we're not going to be
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.160]   able to tell the difference.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.320]   So just for our benefit, so that it would help us, I'm just going to be referring it
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.520]   to leprosy, but the term leprosy doesn't really cover all of the things that they're mentioning.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.320]   Just in case there's any medical people in here saying, "Hey, that's not true."
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.160]   So they already acknowledge that it covers more than that.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   But for our study, I'm just going to be referring to all of it as just leprosy.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.000]   So among the 61 defilements of ancient Jewish law that is mentioned in the Old Testament,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.240]   leprosy was second only to the dead body in seriousness.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.800]   And you could clearly see that in chapter 13 and 14.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   The way that they dealt with leprosy.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.440]   So if there's any one particular disease that really stood out among other diseases, like
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.040]   if you caught this, it was the end to your life.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.080]   Like today, I think when you hear the word cancer, that's the word that most people are
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   afraid of.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.360]   You go to the doctor and they say it could be cancerous and automatically your heart
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.680]   drops because it leads to death.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.200]   Well at that particular time, leprosy was cancerous and it was much more serious than
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.640]   cancer because of all the ramifications before it led to the death.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.680]   So it was pretty much the worst thing, worst news that you can get.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.840]   And leper wasn't allowed to come within six feet of any other human being.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.660]   They weren't allowed to be near any human.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.820]   So imagine what that does to an individual, that if you get leprosy, you're not allowed
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.060]   to have any contact with other human beings, including your own family members, because
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.820]   the moment you came into contact with them, they became unclean.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.780]   So it forced complete isolation.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.340]   This disease was considered so revolting that the leper wasn't permitted to come within
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.340]   150 feet of anyone when the wind was blowing, just in case it was infectious.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.620]   So if there was any kind of wind, normally not even six feet, even among your family
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.260]   members, but if there was any kind of wind blowing, you couldn't be anywhere near them,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.900]   where you couldn't even hear them.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.980]   The Jewish custom said that you should not even greet a leper.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.340]   Actually this is not in scripture, but the Jewish community automatically equated that
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.460]   with sin.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.100]   So if somebody has leprosy, it must be because they've been cursed by God, so they were treated
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.100]   accordingly.
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.180]   Not only, they weren't treated with any kind of compassion.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.900]   So not only were they completely isolated, they were considered to be unclean, and they
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.420]   deserved it.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.180]   And one rabbi actually bragged that he would not even buy an egg on a street where he saw
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.460]   a leper, and another boasted that he threw rocks at lepers to keep them far from him.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.460]   So it just kind of gives you the prejudice and the kind of life a leper lived.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.100]   So think about all the situations in the New Testament where Jesus is healing a leper,
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.400]   or a leper is coming and crying out to God, that the cultural circumstance behind that
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.140]   particular individual and what he was experiencing.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.940]   So it gives us kind of a better understanding of Jesus' interaction with the leper, and
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.900]   why that was so shocking, right?
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.180]   Everybody was so concerned that Jesus was hanging around with prostitutes and tax collectors,
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.220]   but a leper among all of them would have been considered the filthiest.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.140]   So if they were shocked that Jesus was hanging around with tax collectors, imagine the shock
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:16.100]   when Jesus actually encountered lepers, what they must have been thinking.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.220]   Lepers lived in a community with other lepers until they either got better or died, one
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.400]   or the other.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.140]   This was the only way that people knew to contain the spread of contagious forms of
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.140]   leprosy.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.160]   So they were so afraid of leprosy.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:37.820]   They put them in isolation, and again, the only remedy that they had, there was no medicine,
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.780]   there was nothing else they could do other than put them in isolation and see if this
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.100]   is eventually going to lead them to die, which in most cases it did.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.580]   So the disease in itself was a horrible, horrible disease, where you would have all kinds of
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:02.100]   boils and we're going to just lightly touch upon some of the things that chapter 13 says,
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.960]   but beyond just that, there was absolutely no compassion.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.340]   Imagine if today, if somebody was diagnosed with cancer and the first thing that they
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.300]   do is they ship you out of the house.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.860]   They clean up your bed, they pack up all your stuff, they burn everything that you owned,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.940]   and then you were thrown out and then you couldn't have contact with your family members.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.340]   That was the first thing that happened to a leper.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:33.740]   So it wasn't simply that they had to go through this physical ailment, this difficulty of
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.100]   even just surviving and breathing, like socially.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.180]   Not only that socially, spiritually, they just automatically assumed you must have done
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.740]   something to deserve this.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:50.660]   So it was like the worst condemnation, worst news that you can possibly get.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:57.380]   In chapter 13, God gives specific orders for the priests basically to function as doctors.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:03.660]   They don't have the cure, but they are called to be the people who diagnose whether they
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.220]   had this or not.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.260]   So they function like a public health officer.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.300]   And it wasn't on a whim.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.020]   It wasn't just something that they looked and you determined for yourself.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.620]   That's why in chapter 13, there's detailed information.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:23.460]   So I'm guessing that if you were diligent that you read through it, or even if you did
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.820]   read through it, you probably just remember portions of it, but I'm guessing that you
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.420]   didn't dissect and exposit this text.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:39.500]   But you just kind of knew enough to actually, wow, this is horrendous.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.180]   The chapter is divided into two large portions.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:50.660]   The first portion is about diagnosing the abnormalities in the human skin, which is
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.660]   verse 1 through 46.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:57.700]   And like I told you, my goal today is not to comb through the details of what God told
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.220]   them to look for, but what it ultimately points to.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.140]   The second part of it is diagnostic against abnormalities in the clothing and similar
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:13.040]   articles, which we would probably today call it molding.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.260]   But they were concerned about anything that was rotting and it was unclean, and if it
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.400]   had any touch or came anywhere near leopard, they were so afraid of it, they said the only
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.740]   way to deal with that is to completely burn it.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.460]   So that's how the chapter 13 is divided.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.700]   When we get to chapter 14, he's going to be talking about how to cleanse it, how does
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.080]   a leper come back into society, right?
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.940]   But today it's mostly about how to diagnose it and how to determine and what to do with
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.460]   them once that is determined.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:51.380]   If a person who had these symptoms, leprous symptoms, and they weren't exactly sure if
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.340]   they were clean, immediately they were isolated.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:10:00.020]   So even if you looked like you might have it, even if it wasn't full blown, that they
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.380]   were concerned that they saw some kind of abnormality in your skin or some kind of boil
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:13.320]   or whiteness on the tip of your hair, whatever it might be, immediately you went into isolation.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:19.420]   So the person being examined could be isolated for as long as two weeks, just because they
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.060]   might, they were afraid, right?
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.700]   And I know that, again, today if somebody has a cold and we have a rule in our church,
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:34.180]   if your child is sick, not to bring them into the nursery because you don't want this spreading.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.740]   But usually it's until you have medicine or you get better and they come back.
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.140]   But they were so afraid of this disease.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.780]   Again, even God said if there was even a chance that you might have it, they went immediately
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.500]   into isolation, up to two weeks, to make sure that you didn't have it.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:58.980]   And if you did have it, then the full blown thing of what God tells them to do.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.940]   Now again, as I mentioned to you, I'm not going to be going through like verse 1 through
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.740]   8, God says to look at this leprosy in this way and then, you know, that's not what I'm
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.740]   going to be doing today.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:14.200]   I'm going to be looking at the broad picture of what this ultimately points to.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:23.700]   The Bible clearly points to this leprosy as an illustration of human sin.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:30.620]   And there's nothing that paints that picture more than what we see in chapter 13 and chapter
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.140]   14 about how it ultimately relates to sin.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.460]   So what I'm going to be doing today is in what way does this point to sin?
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.700]   What are some specific things God told them to do and how does that ultimately reveal
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:49.340]   what's how God views sin?
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.140]   So leprosy has a symbolism that ultimately points to sin.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.520]   Again, there was nothing taught in the Old Testament law that symbolized the devastating
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.620]   effect of sin more than the disease of leprosy.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.780]   If you remember in Jeremiah's day, God's condemnation against the prophets of Israel was that they
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.820]   took the sins of Israel lightly.
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.380]   In Jeremiah 6, verse 14 says, "They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.740]   peace,' when there is no peace."
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.740]   And that was the primary condemnation of God's prophets during that period in Jeremiah's
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.740]   time.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:35.180]   In other words, the way God saw sin and the way the prophets saw sin was not even close.
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:42.940]   In fact, the whole point of the gospel, the whole point of the law was to bring us, remember,
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.420]   to show us what?
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.900]   The utter sinfulness of sin.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:54.020]   It's at the whole point of all of these laws, not just about leprosy, but in particular
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.020]   leprosy.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:00.000]   But everything that he was doing up to the coming of Christ is to reveal just how ugly
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.660]   and deadly and devastating sin is, so that when Christ comes, that they would all recognize
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.420]   a dire need for a Savior.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:15.580]   So someone who does not see sin as God sees sin, their repentance is always going to be
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.580]   superficial.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.540]   They just feel bad.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.380]   They didn't do the right thing.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.980]   But it doesn't bring them to a point of devastation where they're beating their chest like the
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:30.740]   tax collector and can't even lift up their head because they see a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:38.100]   So the whole point of all the laws was to reveal to us just how devastating this sin
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.100]   is.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.740]   And that this sin is not outside.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.500]   It's inside of us.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   And nothing highlights that more than this particular disease of leprosy.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:59.220]   And so again, the sin of the prophets in the time of Jeremiah, the time of Isaiah, it wasn't
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.380]   that they didn't recognize sin in Israel.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.720]   They just didn't think it was that big of a deal.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.940]   And that's the first mistake that any Christian makes is that we sin.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.140]   It's like, well, where do you draw the line?
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.940]   And then we start to excuse sin.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.460]   We start to trivialize sin.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:25.700]   And next thing you know, the cross and Christ and our salvation also becomes trivial.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.140]   There are several things that this particular disease points to.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.980]   Sin is deeper than the skin.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.420]   So what they recognize, whether it was the boils or whether it was the whiteness on their
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:43.940]   hair and various things that God tells them to recognize, it ultimately points to a decaying
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.660]   of something that's happening inward.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.160]   It wasn't just a simple skin disease.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.660]   This rotting was taking place inwardly, but the symptoms were being shown outwardly.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.180]   And that's exactly how the sin is described.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:06.940]   The symptoms that he mentions in chapter 13, swelling in a rash, a whiteness, raw flesh,
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.580]   boils, burns, various skin eruptions.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:16.340]   And as disgusting as all of those things are, all of those things only pointed to the decay
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.740]   that was happening within the body.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:25.460]   So it wasn't simply a surface disease that if they found the right ointment and they
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.160]   cleansed themselves, that somehow this disease was going to go away.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.300]   They had no cure for this.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.460]   So all the external things that it points to was ultimately pointing to something that
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.500]   was happening much deeper within them.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.540]   In Jeremiah 17, 9, it says, "The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.540]   sick.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.540]   Who can understand it?"
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.020]   So God describes sin as not simply an act.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:54.700]   It is an act that follows a heart that has already fallen and decayed.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:03.820]   Again, as you know, Jesus told us that sin comes from the corruption of the heart.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.380]   The act of sinning is simply an expression of the sinful decay within.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.460]   So when we talk about sanctification and discipleship, we can get somebody who's not reading the
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.460]   Bible to read the Bible.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.860]   We can get somebody who's not evangelizing to evangelize.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.340]   We can get somebody who's not giving to give.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.460]   But it doesn't deal with what's happening inside.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:30.860]   Somebody who's corrupt in nature can go through all of that and have no change in their life.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.900]   It just becomes—they just become more disciplined.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:40.360]   They become better at acting out their righteousness without actually being righteous.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.420]   So this particular disease, again, the surface thing only points to the outside, but the
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.420]   real decay was happening inside, just like sin.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.820]   Sin is something that happens within.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:56.020]   So until there is an encounter with God, where God opens our eyes to see the glory of who
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:03.020]   he is, and there is no change happening inwardly, all that stuff that we do on the outside,
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.380]   it only covers up the decay.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.160]   It's just like putting Band-Aid on somebody who has leprosy.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.900]   So the first thing that the disease of leprosy points to is that it goes in.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:20.020]   The outer things are only a symptom of what is happening inside.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.980]   Secondly, sin is never dormant.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:31.220]   So all those passages that I listed there in chapter 13 and on, every part of that examination
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.940]   is to examine carefully to see.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.700]   The reason why they are in isolation is to watch them carefully to see if all the skin
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.980]   disease are spreading.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.760]   If there wasn't a hand, does it eventually show up?
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.900]   Just like cancer, right?
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.860]   First thing that they notice to see how serious this cancer is, is the cancer spreading?
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.820]   That's exactly what they were watching for this disease.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:58.740]   So all of these passages that I noted here was instructions to carefully watch to see
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.220]   if it spreads.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:06.120]   So again, the purpose of the close examination and time that they needed to observe these
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.460]   symptoms on the skin was to see if it is going to spread.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.220]   Leprosy was not a dormant disease, but one that eventually spread throughout the rest
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.300]   of the body.
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.060]   And that's exactly how sin is described in James chapter 1, 14 to 15.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.820]   When each person is tempted, when he is lured and enticed by his own desire, then desire
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.740]   when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.740]   death.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.460]   Sin is never dormant.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:38.420]   So whenever we compromise a little bit, that little bit usually grows.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.540]   Whether it is lost, whether it is lying, whether it is compromise, whether it's bitterness,
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.420]   whether it's slander, it never stays dormant.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.460]   You never decide and say, "I'm going to do this much."
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.340]   But when you give room for sin, that sin has a tendency to spread.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:00.040]   And not only spreads within us, it spreads around to whoever we are with.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.340]   And that's why the Bible describes somebody who is divisive and somebody who is teaching
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.060]   false doctrine, they spread like gangrene.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:15.460]   In other words, they have a corrupting quality about them because they're embracing sin.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.980]   And so that's how sin is described in the scripture.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:27.140]   It not only points to something deeper, but sin has a way of spreading.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.380]   And it spreads to the people who are the closest to us.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:37.200]   So if you're a husband and you compromise in sin, it affects your wife.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.940]   If you're a wife, it affects your husband.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:45.540]   And if it's a husband and wife that's compromising, it affects your children.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.220]   No matter how much we try to disciple our kids, they're going to model whatever they
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.120]   see at home.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.380]   So if slandering is a part of the environment, if compromising is a part of the environment
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.740]   at home, no matter how much you try to send them to VBS and teach them scripture, they're
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.740]   going to catch that.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.900]   And that's a tendency of how sin works.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.860]   So again, leprosy was never dormant.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:18.300]   If you had true leprosy, they isolated them to watch to see if it was going to grow.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.740]   Sin ultimately defiles.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.360]   There was a corrupting nature.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.140]   The word "unclean" is used 54 times in Leviticus.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.680]   It describes a ceremonial defilement that makes the victim unfit for social life or
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.100]   for participation in worship at the house of God.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:51.100]   Because of this corruption, they weren't able to participate in worship.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:57.700]   So if you read Psalm 51, let's turn our Bibles to Psalm 51.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.300]   David describes his sin in detail.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.940]   And I want you guys to, I've already written it down for you, but if you can look at Psalm
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:21.140]   51, he describes how his sin has defiled his eyes, his mind, his ears, his bones, his heart,
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.140]   his mouth, in every part of his life.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.100]   So it didn't just affect his heart, it didn't just affect his mind.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.500]   He says, "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love, according to your
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.500]   abundant mercy.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.300]   Blot out my transgressions, wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:42.100]   For I know my transgressions, that my sin is ever before me.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.300]   And against you and you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.420]   you may be justified in your word and blameless in your judgment."
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.940]   Verse 6, "Behold, you delight in truth and inward being, and you teach me wisdom in secret
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.940]   heart."
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.200]   So over and over again, it describes all the different parts.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.660]   He basically goes through every different part of his being, and he describes how sin
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.940]   and his guilt affected every part of it.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.620]   So sin in our lives, a lot of times we think it affects our heart, but it affects our ability
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.220]   to reason.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:23.540]   So to be able to understand even the Bible logically, there has to be a regeneration.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.060]   To be able to discern truth and what is right and what is wrong.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.620]   You can say, "Well, I don't trust my heart, but I trust my intellect.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.620]   I trust my judgment."
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.900]   No, the scripture says it affects all of us.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.700]   It affects our ability to understand.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.780]   It affects our vision.
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.100]   It affects our appetite.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:46.340]   It affects what makes us happy.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.740]   Sometimes people say, "Maybe these movies are inappropriate."
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.900]   And every once in a while, somebody will say, "Well, it doesn't bother me."
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.500]   Because sin has affected your conscience.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:06.180]   So the way that leprosy is described in scripture, it has a corrupting nature of every part of
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.180]   who we are.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.580]   And so whatever sin touches, it defiles.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.380]   Only the blood of Jesus Christ can wash away that defilement.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.220]   That's not something that we just will ourselves away from.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:22.180]   Once you become defiled by sin, the only way that we can be cleansed from that, according
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:27.460]   to scripture, is by the blood of Christ.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.740]   And then ultimately, sin isolates.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:42.940]   In Leviticus 13, 45-46, "The leper's person who has the disease shall wear torn clothes
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:48.420]   and let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry out,
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.460]   'Unclean, unclean!'
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.640]   He shall remain unclean as long as he has the disease.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   He is unclean.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.780]   He shall live alone.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.820]   His dwelling shall be outside the camp."
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.220]   So think about that.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:09.820]   If you were suspected of having this disease, there was no treatment, there was no doctors,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.060]   there was no compassion.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:19.340]   The first reaction that you got from the priest was, "Get all his clothes and put it in
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.060]   isolation and burn it."
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.780]   The second thing is to inform his parents and take whatever necessities and send them
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.300]   outside the camp.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.260]   And he has to live, what it says, alone.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.460]   By the law of God, he becomes alone.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:41.900]   Do you remember what happens in Adam and Eve, the first thing that happens when they sin?
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.500]   They get isolated.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:49.220]   They're not physically gone, but they're together, but they cover themselves.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.980]   So they're emotionally, socially, spiritually, they're completely isolated.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.140]   They're isolated from God, and they're isolated from each other.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.020]   So remember the peace offering?
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:02.120]   The peace offering is a reversal of that curse where you're united with God and you're united
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.220]   with one another.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:13.020]   So this particular sin or disease of leprosy pointed to the isolation which we see in the
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.280]   book of Genesis, chapter 3, when sin comes in, they immediately become isolated.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.860]   Not only are they isolated and have to live alone, just in case somebody may come into
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.220]   contact, they have to constantly yell out, "Unclean, unclean."
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.700]   Now you have to understand, when we say unclean, we don't have this emotional baggage that's
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.820]   attached because we don't live in that culture.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:43.780]   To say you're an unclean and yelling out to everybody else, basically it's a self-condemnation.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:49.540]   It's just like walking around and displaying the ugliest part of who you are everywhere
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   you went.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.460]   Because to be unclean in the Jewish community meant you can't be with people.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.180]   You can't come to worship, you can't give sacrifice, you can't live with your family.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:05.140]   And you have, just by being close to somebody, you would corrupt them.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:10.240]   So remember when you guys were young kids, kids would play around and say, "Oh, he or
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.880]   she has cooties."
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.500]   And they would play tag and whoever has cooties, you have to stay as far away from them as
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.980]   possible.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.620]   And it was a game that the kids played, but imagine if that was real.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.960]   Some kid is labeled to have cooties and nobody can sit next to them.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.140]   Nobody can touch them, you can't eat with them, you can't share with them.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.380]   Basically you can't have friends because if you get near that person, you get cooties.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.420]   Well that's exactly how this particular thing is described.
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:51.920]   The sin spreads, sin defiles, sin is ultimately pointing to the deep corruption inside.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.280]   But I think the most painful thing, I mean if you were a leper and you had the disease
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:02.500]   of leprosy, I can imagine the only thing that you wanted was to die.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.300]   Can you imagine the pain that this person must have gone through?
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.240]   No human contact whatsoever.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.000]   You can't have a conversation with your family members, you're outside the city, and you
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.760]   can't even think about like, "What did I do wrong?
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.720]   What could I have possibly done wrong for me to deserve this?"
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.480]   And then finally, in Luke chapter 17, then through 19, you know that encounter that Jesus
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.600]   has with the 10 lepers, and I think understanding the background, it gives us a better idea,
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   the cultural background.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.000]   So it says, "On the way to Jerusalem, he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.800]   and as he entered a village, he was met by 10 lepers who stood at a distance."
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.400]   So you can understand why they were standing at a distance, because by law.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.720]   And if they didn't stay at a distance, they could have been stoned.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.640]   Remember what the rabbis said?
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.040]   Beyond scripture, they were bragging about throwing rocks at lepers to keep them at a
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.280]   distance.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.720]   So imagine what would have happened if they drew near.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   This is how they had to live.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:06.080]   They can only be with other lepers, and the fact that they even tried to make contact
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.560]   with Jesus would have been enough for them to get stoned.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.560]   But what else would you do?
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:16.880]   If you were a leper, and the only chance that you could possibly have a normal life is Jesus,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:24.040]   because you heard about him walking on water, you heard about healing the blind and raising
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:29.120]   those who couldn't walk, who were lame, and he's coming to town, that even if you get
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.400]   stoned, it would be better than the situation that they were in.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.120]   So you can understand why they would come yelling at Jesus, "Jesus, Master, have mercy
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.120]   on us."
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:45.600]   So again, it really highlights when they say, "Have mercy on us," considering knowing everything
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   that they were going through.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.400]   "When he saw them, he said to them, 'Go and show yourself to the priest.'"
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.600]   Now why did he do that?
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:57.040]   Because it says in the book of Leviticus, because the priest had the power to determine
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.600]   whether they had this disease or not.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:04.520]   So in order for them to enter back into the camp and to be able to have any human contact,
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.840]   the priest first had to clear it.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.480]   And so that's why Jesus says, "If you want to be healed, when he says, 'Go show the priest,'"
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.000]   in other words, this was promised from Jesus saying, "You're going to be cleansed."
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.840]   Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.840]   voice.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   Right?
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:28.400]   Because as soon as he was healed, you know, the first thing that you would think, humanly
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.560]   speaking, because you want the approval of the priest, because that means that everything
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:39.040]   that caused pain in your life was going to be cleared by the priest.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.040]   You can go home.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.520]   You can come back.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.960]   But only one person recognized that the real gift, the real gift was not the leprosy in
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   itself that being gone, but Jesus himself.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.120]   Because he was the healer.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.000]   The others were eager to get back into their normal life.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.400]   The only one who turns around is that when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.520]   God with a loud voice.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.760]   And he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.000]   Now he was a Samaritan.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.280]   Let me stop right here.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.600]   Now, again, understanding the cultural and the legal background behind what they were
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.000]   suffering and all that, we can understand why they were so eager to go and get cleansed
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.880]   and get back into society.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.320]   But the point of everything that Jesus did, the point of every part of the law was ultimately
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.520]   to bring them to God.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520]   Ultimately to bring them to God.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.800]   They could be healed, but in the end, eventually, if you don't meet God, eventually you're going
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.720]   to die in your sins.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.840]   You're superficially healed, right, of your leprosy, but the healing, the real sickness
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.960]   in mankind is the disease of sin, the corrupt nature inside.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.980]   And so, this we see even in our culture where people who are desperate, they come to God
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:03.960]   if they're poor, if they have family issues or you're hurt by something.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.400]   And I see so many people coming to God when they're desperate, but as soon as their desperation
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.980]   is gone, so is their desperation for God.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.640]   And so, it's almost like we're waiting for another disaster to happen to bring revival.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.320]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.920]   Disasters tend to bring revival.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.840]   And that's why, like if you go to a persecuted church, there's a fire in them because of
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.480]   the persecution.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:34.880]   But remember what Jesus said to Thomas when Jesus was resurrected and he said, "Well,
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.160]   let me see you."
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:42.600]   And then he sees Jesus and puts his fingers inside of his scars and Jesus says, "You believe
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.880]   because you saw, but blessed are those who do not see and yet they believe."
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:55.400]   In other words, if revival is dependent upon your circumstance, your love for God will
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.880]   come and it goes.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   And as soon as the fire is gone in your life, so is the fire for Christ.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.060]   And that was the sin of the nine lepers.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.440]   They were healed of their leprosy, but they were never healed of their sin because they
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.040]   didn't recognize Christ.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.080]   All they recognized was the gift.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:20.000]   And so our churches, if we're not careful, can be filled with people who are coming to
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.400]   Christ because of the gift, not recognizing Christ himself is the gift.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.240]   Because only Christ can forgive us and only Christ can cleanse us of our sins.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:36.440]   And the whole reason why this law is even in here is to ultimately point us to Christ.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:42.920]   Jesus is, yes, he could heal us of leprosy, but even if you are healed of leprosy, it
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.480]   is only superficial.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.200]   So it kind of gives us a better picture.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.480]   In the end, he says, "We're not ten cleansed.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.720]   Where are the nine?
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.560]   Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.880]   And he said to him, "Rise and go your way.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.360]   Your faith has made you well."
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.520]   Of course, you would say, "Well, nine of them was made well.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.160]   So what does it mean when Jesus says, 'Your faith has made well?'"
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.040]   He's talking about his sin.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.560]   There's only one person out of these ten who was truly made well, the one whose sins were
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.640]   forgiven.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:24.220]   And that's the thing that, again, we can, if we're not careful, make Christianity about
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:29.560]   answered prayers, about getting a good job, and about being healthy and living long lives,
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:35.040]   and being able to have enough money to take care of our children, and all of these things
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:44.160]   are and can be a blessing, but they're all superficial.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.480]   You can have children who are raised in a good home, well-protected, well-provided.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:56.640]   They are A-plus students, get to the best colleges, and yet they don't know Christ.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.080]   And all of that that you did to help them actually ends up hurting them if they don't
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   meet Christ.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:10.600]   So ultimately, everything that God does, whether it's wealth, or whether it's pain, whether
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.160]   it's good, or whether it's bad, if it doesn't lead us to Christ, it actually ends up hurting
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.760]   us.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.880]   And then finally, sin is ultimately only fit for fire.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.840]   And the final thing that he says about the garments is, "A defiled garment was to be
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.040]   burned in the fire.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.720]   It was not to be purified, but destroyed."
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.360]   There was no redemption for sin.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:41.840]   Sinners are redeemed, but sin in and of itself, it says, is to be burned.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.640]   So when Jesus spoke about hell, he used the word Gehenna.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.840]   And the word Gehenna was a literal place outside of Jerusalem where it was a trash dump, and
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.240]   Israelites would have been very familiar with that site, with the trash being burned all
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.240]   the time.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.800]   And it was described in Mark 9 45 as unquenchable fire.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.840]   And the Bible describes the very reason why Christ came was because of this.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:13.040]   So as hideous as this particular disease was, all of that points to the hideousness of our
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   sin.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:22.800]   And as I started this Bible study reminding us, until sin becomes utterly sinful, our
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.000]   salvation doesn't become utterly glorious.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.840]   And until our salvation is utterly glorious, our passion, our love, our obedience will
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.520]   always become a burden.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.360]   Because Christianity ultimately is about drawing near to Christ.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:47.880]   But if drawing near to Christ isn't the source of your joy, and it just becomes homework,
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.200]   it just becomes something that you have to do, because you don't recognize what it is
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.480]   that you have in Christ.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.840]   And the reason we don't recognize what it is that we have in Christ is because we have
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:03.520]   never felt the devastation of sin.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.640]   Some people have.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.080]   A lot of people, sin is looked upon as a mistake.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.280]   Something that we shouldn't have been doing.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.120]   We should have gotten an A, but we got a C. Some people get Fs.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.640]   And it is not utterly sinful.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.960]   We don't see the devastation of this sin, even though it is happening even in our own
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.400]   lives.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:28.600]   That sin that is dormant in our lives is having an effect on your relationship, it's having
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.680]   an effect on your marriage, it's having an effect on your heart, it's having an effect
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:39.200]   on your worship, it's having an effect on our children.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:45.160]   But when we don't recognize this, when we don't recognize the devastation of sin, we
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.040]   don't feel an urgency to come to Christ.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.320]   Until we can't pay our bills, until we get sick, until something physically goes wrong,
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.760]   we don't sense an urgency.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:06.240]   Urgency is always there if we recognize just how devastating sin is, because sin is always
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   dormant.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.420]   Sin is always wanting to creep into our lives.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.420]   And how vulnerable we are to deception until we come to Christ.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:25.600]   So all of this ultimately points to that, because the Day of Atonement, like all of
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.280]   this, was to cover all of this.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:38.400]   So imagine how it would change our spiritual lives if we saw our sins like we see leprosy.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.080]   Imagine how desperate we were, imagine like the ten lepers were crying out to Jesus, "Have
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   mercy on us!"
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.060]   We would be in that same position if we saw sin the way God saw sin.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.240]   We would be the tax collector up on the hill beating our chest, not being able to lift
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.160]   our eyes.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:03.300]   If we saw sin as it is described here, as leprosy.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.800]   And that was the whole point of Leviticus, the whole point of the sacrificial laws.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:15.200]   The whole point of the law is to get us to get to a point, like the lepers, to cry out
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:24.320]   to God, to look to the cross in desperation and tears.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:31.280]   I looked at Google to look up pictures of leprosy, and it was so hideous I didn't even
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.880]   want to show it to you.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.440]   I showed you some grotesque stuff.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:42.720]   I showed you like beheaded lambs and blood, and I showed you all of that because God showed
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.600]   like this is what the Israelites saw on a daily basis.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.360]   But I looked at the picture of these people who had leprosy, and there's pictures of them,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.360]   I couldn't show it to you.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:57.400]   And I don't want to show it to you because it is that grotesque.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:06.120]   And that image that is described in Leviticus 13 and 14 was ultimately meant to show us
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.320]   our sins.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:17.400]   So again, as we continue to study the book of Leviticus, like that our reality, not to
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.000]   be formed by the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.320]   And these things ought to be renewing our mind to see sin from God's perspective, and
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:36.280]   see redemption from his perspective, so that we would live our lives as he desires.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.800]   The three discussion questions for today, in what ways have you seen or experienced
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.080]   sin spreading when not dealt with in repentance?
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.240]   Secondly, how has sin defiled something precious in your life?
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.600]   For example, relationships, family, worship, et cetera.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.800]   I'll just give you some examples, but in what specific way have you noticed or seen in your
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:02.360]   life and maybe in something that you've observed, and how sin has a way of corrupting?
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.100]   Third, how does sin cause isolation?
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:10.480]   What does sin leading to isolation teach us about true fellowship?
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.360]   And I'm just going to explain that right now, just in case, you know, I don't want you guys
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.600]   going off tangent.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:22.620]   What I mean by that is, if sin isolates, righteousness brings us together, correct?
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:27.280]   So oftentimes when we talk about fellowship, it's about people who are compromising in
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.000]   sin commiserating together.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.960]   That's not fellowship.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:41.120]   Because if the core nature of sin is isolation, righteousness leads to communion.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:45.640]   So how does that play out in the life of a Christian and in the church?
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:51.560]   So let me pray for us, and then I'll let you guys take time in your small group.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.760]   Gracious Father, we thank you for your living word.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:04.240]   Lord, these are heavy truths, Lord God, that we need to really meditate and contemplate,
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.840]   because we know it in our head.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   And at times, many times, Lord God, it's not in our hearts.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.460]   Help us, Lord God, to sympathize with those who have experienced this devastating disease
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:25.440]   in one form or another, that we may recognize what you've been trying for many years to
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:36.720]   show the nation of Israel, just how desperate and sick we are when we allow sin in our lives.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:43.640]   What it is that you have saved us from, that we would naturally need to worship in view
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:50.800]   of this mercy, that we would joyfully offer our bodies as a living sacrifice.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:42:02.960]   Lord, we approach you humbled, desperate, crying out for mercy.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:09.760]   I pray that the truth and the power of the gospel would have a deep impact on us, that
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:17.080]   we would not just coast along from day to day, from event to event, from Sunday to Sunday.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:25.280]   Devastate us in our sins, that we may be delivered and live a life truly glorious for your name.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.080]   Bless the time that we have in our discussion.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.040]   Help us to be open and honest, and that we may sharpen one another as we have this time.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.820]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:43.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
