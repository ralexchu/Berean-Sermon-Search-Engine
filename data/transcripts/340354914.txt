[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 2, I'll be reading from
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:17.320]   verse 14 to 18. Our main focus this morning is going to be on the two verses, 14 and 15.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.800]   But I'll be reading all the way down to verse 18. "Therefore, since the children share in
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.960]   the flesh and blood, he himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death he
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.860]   might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is the devil, and might free
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.700]   those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. For surely he
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.160]   does not give help to angels, but he gives help to the descendants of Abraham. Therefore,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.560]   he had to be made like his brethren in all things, so that he might become a merciful
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.460]   and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.440]   of people. For since he himself was tempted in that which he has suffered, he is able
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:04.840]   to come to the aid of those who are tempted." Let's pray. Gracious Father, we want to thank
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.480]   you again for opening our eyes to see what it is that we have in you, to regenerate our
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.540]   hearts, allowing us to see the hope that we have in Christ, to know, Father, that this
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.640]   life isn't final, that all our hopes, Lord, will come into fruition when Christ come in
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.800]   full glory. Help us, Lord God, to look to your word with a renewed perspective, renewed
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.440]   mind, not simply to make this life better, but that our hope in Christ may be more solidified,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   our understanding of your grace deepened, that our life, Lord God, would bear fruit
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.440]   in every way. Help us, Lord, to look into your word without prejudice and to apply it,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.320]   Lord, willingly and obediently. We thank you, Father, in Jesus' name we pray, Amen. You
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.720]   know, if I was to ask you, like, what your opinion is and how many people do you think
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.960]   in this world are atheists? I'm not going to, for the sake of time, I'm not going to
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.360]   actually ask you to raise your hand, but most likely the number that you are thinking is
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.840]   probably a lot higher than the reality, especially because of where we live, and especially because
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.960]   many of us have experienced life on the university campus, and as a result of that, you kind
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.360]   of have, we kind of have a skewed view of the world and thinking that, you know, we're
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:41.680]   surrounded by atheists. That is not the actuality. The actual number of people who claim to believe
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.240]   in something supernatural, whether that's God or something else outside of that, more
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.880]   than 84% of the world consider themselves religious. They believe something happens
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.600]   after life and there is a higher being, higher power. It doesn't mean that 16% are atheists.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.760]   Out of the 16% who do not claim to be religious, only 7% say that they are atheists, and the
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.720]   other 9% say that they are agnostic. Agnostic meaning that they haven't decided one way
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.080]   or the other. That they wouldn't be surprised if there was God and they wouldn't be surprised
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   if there wasn't, but if there is a God, we don't know. We don't have any way to get to
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.080]   him. That's what an agnostic is. So in actuality, the number of committed atheists are 7%. Now,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.880]   if you had any conversation with a committed atheist, you'll find that among the 7% who
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.120]   are atheists, a huge chunk of them are not atheists because of science or reason. Many
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.200]   of the atheists are atheists because they had a problem with the church, or they were
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.760]   burned, or they had bad experiences. So in actuality, what we think of an atheist are
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.040]   very small percentage of the world. Of the 84% who say that they believe in something,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.520]   60% of that are monotheists, meaning there's two main religions, Christianity and Muslim.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.800]   Over 60%. Out of the 60%, about 36% will say that they are Christians, and they're lumping
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.240]   Protestant and Catholics together. And then the others are the different Muslim sects
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:27.320]   that they have. If we're not careful, we can automatically think when somebody, you know,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.080]   whether it's a movie star or basketball star, they come up and they get a reward and I want
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.680]   to thank my God. They say, "Oh, he's a Christian. He's like us." Or they would mention something
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.080]   about some supernatural power and how they prayed, and automatically we think, "Oh, they
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.960]   must be like us." The distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is not a belief
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   in God or not believing in God. That is not a distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.720]   A distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is how do we view Jesus Christ? Who is he?
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.080]   What is his identity and what did he do? That's the distinction. So if we make that the distinction
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.840]   between a believer and an unbeliever, what is the actual percentage? Now, years ago,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.320]   in order to distinguish between the liberal Christians or Christians who reject the inerrancy
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.480]   of the Bible, anything supernatural, resurrection of Christ, and the evangelical Christians
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.040]   who confess the fundamental doctrines of Christianity, we started using the term "evangelical Christian,"
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.680]   where we believe in the fundamental doctrines. So whether you are a Baptist or a Presbyterian
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.720]   or whatever denomination, if you believe in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:48.280]   about Jesus, life, death, resurrection, the gifts, the eternal kingdom that's coming,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.440]   that would make us evangelical, no matter how your church may look like. In today's
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.200]   circles, even that term "evangelical" has become watered down, and there are people
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.800]   who are claiming to be evangelical who are dismissing the identity of Christ. It doesn't
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.960]   matter what you believe who Jesus is as long as it works for you, and that has penetrated
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.680]   even into the evangelical church. Now, why the identity of Christ is so important, why
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.400]   that's the dividing line between a Christian and a non-Christian, is because from the very
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:30.160]   get-go that's spelled out for us in the scripture. Today, very few people deny the existence
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.400]   of the human Jesus Christ, because there's too many historical evidences. Whether it
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.880]   is a Jewish scholar or a secular scholar, there's nobody who denies that the human being
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.560]   Jesus Christ actually existed. The question today that's being debated, outside of the
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.520]   church, is "Was that Jesus God?" In the early church, that was not an issue. In the
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.960]   early church, they didn't discuss about Jesus' deity because they had people who
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.720]   were eyewitnesses of Jesus Christ. They had disciples who actually walked with him. 500
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.320]   people saw the resurrection of Jesus Christ. They saw the miracles. He raised people from
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.160]   the dead. So, in the early church, the main struggle was not "Is Jesus God?" The main
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:23.080]   struggle was "Was Jesus really human?" And you see that in the authors of the New Testament,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.400]   that how can this God, who was able to do these fantastic things, that he even laid
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.120]   down his life and then raised it up again, how can that be a human being? In 1 John 4
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.560]   2-3, John wrestles with this false doctrine. "By this you know the Spirit of God. Every
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:47.520]   spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. And every spirit
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.640]   that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the Antichrist." Now,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.960]   obviously, John is not saying comprehensively that if you confess Jesus' humanity, that
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.320]   that makes you a Christian. He's dealing with a very specific false doctrine that was
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.280]   beginning to spread in the early church. That Jesus came, he appeared to be human, but how
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:15.440]   can the God of the universe, who created all things, take on finite man's body? Why would
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.240]   he do that? Well, the author of the book of Hebrews is dealing with that in this text.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:29.320]   In verse 14 and verse 18, he gives two specific reasons why Jesus had to be a man. There's
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.520]   two things that he mentions. In verse 14, he mentions that he had to be flesh in order
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:40.920]   for him to experience death. He had to be human being, because only a human being experiences
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.120]   death. God does not experience death. He's immutable, He's eternal, He's all-powerful.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.720]   So in order for Him to taste death on our behalf, He had to become a human being. Not
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.200]   an appearance of a human being, not something that looked like a human being, but a human
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.880]   being. Second thing he says in verse 17, he became a human being in order to be a sympathetic
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:07.120]   high priest. He could have been a high priest from a distance, but he didn't want to become
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.520]   just a high priest. His intention was to bring us to Him. In order to do that, he had to
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.120]   experience everything that you and I experience in order for him to be a sympathetic, that
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.400]   he can relate to us. Now, I'm going to get to the second part next week, verse 17. Today
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:29.240]   I'm going to be primarily looking at verse 14 and 15. I started this week thinking I'm
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.360]   going to cover it all, but I don't want to skim through any of this. So the first thing
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.880]   that he says in verse 14, and I want to look at these two lines in verse 14 and 15 and
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   really understand in depth what he is saying. Verse 14, "That though death, that through
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.640]   death he might render powerless him who had the power of death." He had to become a human
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.040]   being in order to make powerless him who had the power of death. So who has the power of
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   death here? I mean, it's right here. It's in English. Satan, right? That's what it says.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:13.220]   Wait a second. Doesn't the Bible say that God is the author of life? How did death come
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:20.360]   into humanity? As a penalty of sin. God is the one who said, "If you eat of this tree
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:26.440]   of knowledge of good and evil, you shall surely die." So he's the one who cursed mankind.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:32.420]   So when he says that Satan has the power of death, what does that mean? If you read this
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:38.680]   outside of the context of all of scripture, you can mistakenly think that the spiritual
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.600]   battle is between God who has the power of life, Satan who has the power of death, and
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:50.320]   that we are in this struggle to fight Satan. And then if we are strong, the church is strong,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.880]   God wins. And then if the church is not strong, we don't evangelize, share the gospel, Satan
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:02.680]   wins. If you see demonic movies, like horror movies, that's kind of how it gets presented,
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.000]   right? You have the cross and the Bible and then it hisses and then Satan would come and
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.280]   the devil would overpower the priest and they go back and forth. And obviously this is Hollywood,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.760]   so typically the demons win. Scary movies won't be scary if at the end the demons die
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.920]   and then they disappear because they need to make money. It's sad to say so many people's
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:31.080]   understanding of demonology is not from scripture but from Hollywood. And so our fear of the
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.880]   demonic world, the mystery of the demonic world, oftentimes when I hear people to think
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.720]   an emotional attachment to this demonology, is oftentimes coming from false understanding
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.480]   of what the scripture says. And it's coming from Hollywood, outside of reality. So what
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.160]   does it mean then? If that is not what the scripture says, if Satan is not the ultimate
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:00.120]   authority of death, what does that mean? Just like Jesus has many titles, and every one
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:06.040]   of these titles kind of explains his identity and his work, Satan also has many titles.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:13.600]   The first title that we are given of Satan is Lucifer. Lucifer literally means the morning
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.720]   star. That sounds like a beautiful name for Satan, right? And typically when you think
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.560]   of the idea of the devil that you see on, you know, he's sharp, he's ugly, his face
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.600]   is melting off, and it's like, my name is morning star. It doesn't fit his name. But
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.720]   the reason why his name is first Lucifer is because that's how God created him. God created
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:45.200]   him to be a beautiful creature. He was chief among the angels. We see Archangel Michael,
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:52.000]   Gabriel, all of them were under the authority of Satan. The Bible describes when he rebelled
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.340]   against God that he was so influential he took a third of the angels with him, and so
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:02.400]   a third of the demons are in rebellion against this God. So his first name that we know is
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.700]   Lucifer. We know him as Satan. The word Satan literally means an adversary. When he rebelled
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:14.800]   against God, his intent was to go against whatever God is pushing. God is seeking his
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.160]   glory and he's seeking it through the salvation of mankind, and he's working day and night
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.860]   to oppose that. He's the adversary. Jesus refers to Satan as the ruler of the world
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:34.400]   in John 12 31. Paul calls him the prince of the power of the air in Ephesians 2 2. John
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.580]   also says in 1 John, the whole world is in the power of the evil one. But ultimately
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:47.980]   in 2 Corinthians 4 4 it says the God of this age is Satan. So we know two things about
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:55.420]   Satan. One, he's extremely powerful. He is very, very powerful. He is the most powerful
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:07.140]   angel outside of God. Second, his whole work is to oppose God, is to go against God. The
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.660]   word that is used here to describe Satan is not any of the words. The word that is used
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:17.860]   to describe Satan, the word that is translated devil here is Diabolos. You probably, some
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.980]   of you guys who know Spanish, you can already tell Diablo, the devil. In Greek, Diabolos
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:30.260]   means the accuser. He's the prosecutor. In other words, when he says that Satan has the
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:37.300]   power over death, what he is saying is, as the accuser, anyone who is guilty, he is the
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:44.100]   one who stands before God, accusing him of his sin, that leads to death. So when the
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:50.580]   Bible describes Satan as having power over death, it means that the accuser has the power
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.580]   over the guilty one. And so when Christ comes and he dies and he resurrects and he covers
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:02.740]   us, we are no longer guilty. So he has taken the power of death out of his hands. So we
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:08.140]   are free. In Colossians 2, verse 15, it says, "When he had disarmed the rulers and the authorities,
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:16.300]   he made a public display of them having triumphed over them through him." He disarmed him, because
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.580]   there's nothing to accuse anymore. Because when God sees us, he no longer sees the guilty.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:30.900]   So the devil, the accuser, the prosecutor, has no authority over our lives. If you watch
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.420]   too many scary movies, you know, typically it creates fear of the demons. Now, there
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:43.820]   should be a healthy respect, because they're powerful. The Bible describes them as powerful.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:49.900]   They're more powerful than any angel we know, at least Satan is. But Satan has no power
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:56.340]   over a man or a woman who has been cleansed by the blood of Christ. We belong to God.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:02.780]   The Holy Spirit makes his indwelling in us. So what you see on the Hollywood movie screens
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:08.260]   is not, not only is it not accurate, it is blasphemous. He does not have that kind of
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.580]   authority. In fact, every time we see Satan in the Bible, he is under the umbrella of
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:18.540]   the authority of God. Remember when Lot, in the beginning of the book of Job, he comes
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:24.100]   and he wants to test Lot, and he has to ask permission. The only reason why Lot is a man
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.940]   of faith is because you protected him. Take that hedge away from him and let me at him
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:34.060]   and see what happens. He had to get permission, and God permitted him. When Jesus was headed
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:40.420]   to the cross, Jesus, Jesus says to Peter, "Satan has asked permission to sift you like
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.140]   wheat, but I have prayed for you so that your faith would not fail." So even when he wanted
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:50.540]   to attack Peter, he didn't have any authority. He had to ask permission. Every instance where
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:55.660]   we see the demons in front of Jesus, they're not sharpening their knives and saying, "Let's
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:02.980]   get at our enemy." They bow down on their knees in terror. "Son of God, why have you
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:09.620]   come before your time to torment us?" And they knew that the God who had the authority
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:14.860]   over their souls was standing before them. They stood in terror, just like all the other
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.780]   angels and seraphims and all the elders of the vision that we see in heaven, and they
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:25.820]   are bowed down in worship before this holy, holy, holy God. We see the same terror among
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:33.280]   these demons. When Jesus Christ came, took on human form, he died and was resurrected
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:42.480]   for those who believe we have been set free from that power. Only people who have truly
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:49.160]   been set free from that power really understands what it means to be a follower of Christ.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.520]   You know, I've been mentioning, I've been posting up what's going on in India. Modi,
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:03.640]   who became the second election for to be a prime minister in India. During his reign,
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.660]   if you want to call it, or his rule, persecution, violent persecution against Christian has
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:16.840]   risen 450%. And we're not talking about people making fun of Christian names. We're not talking
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:23.320]   about going to work and Hindus not inviting Christians to their lunch parties. We're talking
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:29.280]   about people literally getting stoned, beaten, some of them put to death. That has risen
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:36.200]   450%. And that's why they were very concerned that if he gets re-elected, that that militant
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:42.360]   Hindu party, that which BJP, that which Modi is from, is going to be even more emboldened.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.440]   So they're concerned if in six years it rose that bad, how much more violent are they going
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.520]   to get once they know that he's starting a new reign. Not only did he win the second
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:58.120]   election, he said it was a landslide. The general consensus in India is that what was
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.040]   happening in the last six years, they want it multiplied going forward. So the Christians
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:11.320]   are very concerned. But in the midst of this, there's good news. And the good news is, about
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.800]   10 years ago, when they did a survey of the number of Christians in India, it came out
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:22.640]   to about 2.6%, which is a very small percent, considering that it's considered an open country,
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.600]   where missionaries have been there for hundreds of years. In the last 10 years, the percentage
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:37.220]   of Christians has risen from 2.6 to over 5% in the midst of this intense persecution.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.460]   You guys know, those of you who've been with us in China back and forth, that when we first
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.740]   went into China, the openness to the gospel, not the government, but the people. But every
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.340]   year that we've been in China, it's gotten harder and harder and harder, not because
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.740]   of the pressure of the government, but because people have been exposed to wealth and freedom.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.840]   And so lukewarmness began to come in to the Chinese church. 10 years ago, we were hearing
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.960]   about the multiplication of the underground church just spreading like wildfire. But in
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.900]   recent years, especially after the Beijing Olympics, that that hunger began to just die.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:17.260]   And even the churches that were established, they're having problems with nominal Christianity.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.140]   Only recently in the last couple years where the persecution has been revamped, we're also
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.460]   hearing with the intense persecution that the underground church is starting to get
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:32.620]   remobilized. And we're hearing horrible news of persecution, but along with that, a revival
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:40.260]   of the underground church. The reason why I share this is that throughout history and
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:49.340]   throughout history in scripture, the truth of the gospel has always spread from a few
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:56.500]   who genuinely believe bearing a lot of fruit. And very rarely is it a lot of people bearing
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:04.820]   a little fruit. Because the power of the gospel is not in us. It's not in us. It is not our
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:10.060]   effort. It is not our talent. It is not our organization. It is when we surrender our
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:15.340]   life to the truth of what we see in the scripture. If we genuinely believe that the Son of God
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:22.500]   came and lived among us all for the purpose of rescuing us from the one who had the power
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:32.340]   over death, and that belief, that true belief, that genuine faith changes genuine Christians.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:40.860]   And true fruit come from that. Charles Wesley, in his hymn "And Can It Be" writes about that
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:47.300]   truth. "And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood? Died he for
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:53.940]   me who caused his pain for me. Who him to death pursued. Amazing love, how can it be
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.860]   that thou my God shouldst die for me? Amazing love, how can it be that thou my God shouldst
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:06.900]   die for me?" And then the second part goes, "Tis mystery all, the immortal dies." He's
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:14.240]   talking about the incarnation of Christ. It's a mystery. Like why would God come? He's reiterating
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:21.340]   what the early church had a problem with. Why would the immortal take on human form?
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:28.660]   Why would the infinite become finite? "Tis mystery all, the immortal dies. Who can explore
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:34.540]   his strange design? In vain the firstborn seraph tries to sound the depth of love divine.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:40.660]   Tis mercy all, let earth adore. Let angel minds inquire no more." "Tis mercy all, let
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:48.580]   earth adore. Let angel minds inquire no more." The beginning of sanctification is wrapped
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:56.620]   up in this song. It's when the mystery of the gospel begins to make sense to us. And
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:03.180]   we are impacted by this truth. That's the beginning of sanctification. Not determination,
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:11.940]   not organization, not money, not education, but this truth, this mystery. And trying to
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:19.120]   figure out, why would he do this for me? What is man that you are so mindful of him? Why
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:28.100]   did he come? Second part of it is, I think it kind of points us even further into this
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:34.660]   mystery. Verse 15, "And might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:41.180]   all their lives." Before we just skim through it, let's ask a practical question. How many
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:51.580]   of you came this morning aware of death? Especially at a young church. How many of you are gripped
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:59.780]   by this fear of death? And you felt this bondage because you're afraid to die? Maybe a few,
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:07.460]   maybe a few, but you don't think about that. Let alone feel being bound by it. What does
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:22.500]   he mean by this? Well, here's something interesting. The Greek word for death is thanatos. Think
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:32.880]   about it. The Greek word for death is thanatos. Now why are you giggling? So anybody who's
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:41.180]   watched Endgames, right? Or he was on another one too, right? His name is thanatos. And
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:51.140]   the word is a Greek word for death. Right? Spoiler. So that's where they get the name,
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:57.540]   thanatos. His name means death. But what does he mean? What does the Bible mean when he
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:03.500]   says that the power of death, the fear of death has subjected all of us to slavery?
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:11.060]   Well, the word for life, because death is the absence of life, just like darkness is
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:17.160]   the absence of light, death is the absence of life. Life in the New Testament is primarily
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:24.520]   described as zoe. Not you have 75 years to live, but the life, right? And the best way
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.960]   to describe it if somebody goes bungee jumping or roller coaster or they go somewhere, man,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:36.800]   I feel alive. Right? Zoe, described in Vine's Expository Dictionary says this, "Zoe is used
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:42.200]   in the New Testament of life as a principle." Life in the absolute sense. Life as God has
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.760]   it. "That which the Father has in himself and which he gave to the incarnate Son to
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.040]   have in himself." In John 5.26, "And which the Son manifested in the world," 1 John 1.2,
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.400]   "from this life man has become alienated in consequence of the fall." In other words,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:10.120]   death is the absence of this zoe. It's the separation from the author of life. Life gripped
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:19.800]   by fear of death is described for us in Ephesians 4, 18-19. "Being darkened in their understanding,
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:25.240]   excluded from the zoe of God," life of God, "because of the ignorance that is in them,
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.480]   because of the hardness of their hearts, they having become callous, having given themselves
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:36.560]   over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness." Okay, let
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:43.000]   me wrap this up and what he's saying. That all this desire of greediness, sensuality,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.160]   impurity, all of this is wrapped up because they have become excluded from zoe. And I've
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:57.400]   mentioned this before, I think maybe end of last year I mentioned this. A quick and easy
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:06.600]   way to understand this is FOMO, fear of missing out. Because mankind has been separated from
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:12.480]   the life of God, we are trying to live because naturally, our natural instinct from the moment
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:18.160]   that we are born is to live. We learn how to suck. We didn't go through school to learn
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:25.560]   how to suck. All of a sudden, the mom produces milk and the baby comes and they know he needs
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:31.320]   to eat. And so the moment he is born, instinctively he is kicking to live and that's why he's
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:38.000]   crying. And all our life, instinctively we want to live. That's why we avoid danger,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   that's why we pursue certain things, because we want to feel alive. But the problem is,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.840]   because we have become alienated from this life, this fear of dying, fear of missing
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:57.360]   out causes us to pursue things that have nothing to do with God. Ray Stedman, in his commentary
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:04.840]   on Hebrews, in this particular verse, he says this, "Since death is the absence of life,
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:11.080]   spiritual death is already present in human affairs, appearing as depression, fear, boredom,
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:18.040]   despair, waste, limitation, and defeat. The devil's lie is to convince many that they
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:24.120]   can avoid such experiences by amassing wealth, maintaining youth by strenuous exercise, or
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:31.560]   expensive treatments, searching for adventure, falling in and out of love, gaining the marks
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:40.240]   of success, indulging in widespread travel, satisfying every whim, and so forth." In other
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:47.400]   words, this is how Pastor Ray Stedman describes what he is saying here. People who are gripped
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:54.320]   by fear of death are enslaved because of their fear of missing out. Isn't that the reason
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.520]   why we want to get a better job? Why we look forward to the weekend? And why many people
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.680]   stay off of Facebook? Because they look at Facebook and they see all the great things
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.960]   that everybody else is experiencing and then it produces in them a coveting, and this coveting
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.160]   causes them to pursue things that they don't need or may not have even wanted? Because
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.440]   they're afraid that if I make this decision for Christ, I'm afraid that I'm not going
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.880]   to get that. If I don't give enough money, if I don't get this job, if I don't put enough
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:35.080]   money away, there is this fear. None of that is sin in and of itself. But mankind is described
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:44.280]   as people who have been gripped with this fear of death. Some of the most famous words
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:51.600]   in the Constitution that describes the principle behind the U.S. Constitution. You know this,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.760]   we learned it in school. It says, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.640]   men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:10.200]   rights, that among these are life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness." Life, liberty,
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.800]   and pursuit of happiness. None of these things. Nobody reads that and says, "Oh my gosh, what
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.360]   kind of a lousy country is this?" It's a great country because of this. That we have the
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:27.360]   freedom to pursue things that we believe is going to produce life, produce joy, and produce
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:36.280]   liberty. But in a fallen world, people who are filled with, are gripped with fear of
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:46.840]   death, this pursuit of life leads to death. This pursuit of liberty in our fallen nature
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:55.320]   produces bondage. This pursuit of happiness produces greater sorrow. And that's why Jesus
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:01.160]   says in Matthew 10, 39, "Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:07.320]   for my sake will find it." Because our natural instinct to want to live causes us to pursue
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:14.080]   things that produces death. That's what he means. When Christ came and he was crucified
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.840]   on the cross, and he says, "We have also been crucified along with him." So all this rat
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:27.800]   race that we're tied up in, that causes so much pain and sorrow, broken marriages, broken
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   relationships, all this desire to be somebody, is producing death, and bondage, and sorrow.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:44.240]   Jesus says, "Come, pick up your cross, and follow me." He who loses his life because
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   he finds his life in me, will truly find life. Galatians 5, 13, "For you are called to freedom,
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.000]   brethren, only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.240]   love serve one another." That's why if we're not careful, religiousness can cause more
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:08.880]   bondage if we're not careful. Because what God called us to is freedom. Why do we worship
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:19.280]   God? Because it produces greater joy. Why do we follow Christ? Because I find life there.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:26.840]   Why do we submit ourselves? Because I find liberty. You know what the preamble of the
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:35.160]   satanic church is? There are many things that they believe, but the primary thing that they
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:41.000]   describe at the center of the satanic church, it says this. The founder of the satanic church
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.960]   that was established in 1969, in Hotel California, and I mentioned this a while back, the song
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:53.000]   Hotel California is describing the satanic church. And Anton LaVey says of his church,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.720]   "Nothing is to be gained by denying oneself pleasure. Religious calls for abstinence most
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   often come from faith that view the physical world and its pleasures as spiritually dangerous.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.280]   Satanism is a world affirming, not world denying religion." You know what was interesting?
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.560]   I was reading this week about Anton LaVey and what his beliefs were about satanism.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.880]   And even though he's considered the father of satanism in the modern generation, he said
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:25.680]   he himself doesn't believe in satan. He says he's an atheist. The only reason why he created
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.520]   this church was to give freedom to those who are bound by religion so they can just live
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:37.120]   any way they want. He said he doesn't believe in satan. He says people who believe in satanism
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.560]   are idiots. Those are his exact words. Yet he established this church and he said the
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:51.040]   primary reason is to give freedom. There is no such thing as sin. Just do whatever you
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:59.680]   want. The Bible describes the fall of mankind, the grips that satan has on mankind in 1 John
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.360]   2, 16. "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:11.280]   the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but from the world." Christ came to
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.920]   set us free. In fact, his very first words when he began his public ministry, he went
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:23.760]   into the synagogue and he quoted Isaiah 61, verse 1, which was a messianic promise that
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.560]   when the Messiah comes, that this is what he was going to fulfill. And he read this,
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.920]   "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.320]   to the afflicted. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim the liberty
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:45.480]   to captives and freedom to prisoners." That's how he described why he came. He described
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:55.360]   his human life and human death to free us from the bondage of sin. Again in John 8,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:59.800]   31 and 32, it says, "If you continue in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:05.680]   and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free." And then verse 36, "So
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:13.560]   if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed." Because in our Constitution, we
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:19.680]   have the liberty to pursue life, liberty, and happiness. You know, one of the chief
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.800]   things about living in this country, it's free. And I think that's awesome that we have
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.280]   religious freedom. We don't have to worry about the government coming down on us, at
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:37.280]   least not yet. But in this liberty, the Bible describes liberty as being freed from this
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:45.840]   bondage of sin so that we can find true life in Christ. Until we find liberty in Christ,
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:53.360]   we will automatically be bound by the things of this world. Because we live in fear that
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:36:01.920]   if we give too much to God, that we will lose our liberty. That if we pick up our cross,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:09.440]   that we will lose our joy. That if we give all that God demands, that we will nullify
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:18.480]   our life. And that is a deception of the devil. And that's why Jesus says, "If you find life
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:28.080]   in me, come follow me." You know the perfect example of a man who was truly set free was
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   Apostle Paul sitting in prison, ready to die. And he writes in Philippians 121, "For to
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:43.360]   me to live is Christ and to die is gain." How do you destroy a joy of a man who has
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:54.600]   already been crucified? Death to him is released from this bondage and being set free. People
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.320]   wonder why so many people around the world sacrifice everything, go to weird parts of
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:08.440]   the world, eating strange food, putting their kids in danger, simply to spread this doctrine
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:14.480]   about Jesus' incarnation and resurrection. Why do they do that? Someone who is not set
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.280]   free will never understand. We'll always look at that, maybe in admiration. If you grew
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:25.040]   up in the church, I admire that from a distance. And our testimony is always secondhand. We
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.360]   read something, we heard something. You know, we put the two and two together, we exposited
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.200]   the text, and we look at that and say, "Well, I heard these great things of testimonies
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.760]   and I share this with you." And we're always regurgitating other people's testimonies,
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:50.000]   but we ourselves do not know. Why do we come to church? Are we trying to appease God? Do
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.160]   we think that if we give enough and serve enough that God's going to bless our family
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:01.120]   and our business is going to get better? Is that why we're here? And you do not realize
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:08.880]   that that's the reason why you're here. You are still under bondage. He came to set us
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:18.600]   free. We come here because this is where we experience freedom. Why do we worship God?
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:27.560]   Because I feel the most alive when I am worshiping God. More than NBA finals, more than anything
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:36.440]   else, I feel the most alive when I am near Christ. That's why I come. And that's why
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:44.160]   you come. And if for any other reason, you are in bondage and you know it. That's what
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:51.840]   He means. His incarnation, He came, He took on flesh, and He suffered for our sake. And
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:39:02.760]   He tells us to come. Until this world becomes nothing, it will become too much. Why are
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.200]   these Indian pastors? They're not old men, they're not young men. You know the average
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.560]   age of these Indian pastors that we've been ministering to or trying to support? The average
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:17.640]   of these, age of these people are somewhere between 28 and 44. That's exactly where we
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.240]   are as a church. Average. Some of us are a little bit higher, some of us are a little
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.800]   bit lower. But that's the average age of the pastors. They look a lot older. When I first
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.640]   went there, I thought these guys were at least in their 60s, but found out the majority of
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:37.680]   them were somewhere right around there, 28 to 43. So out of the 45, 50 pastors that we
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:43.560]   support, only about one or two of them are not married. Majority of them have very young
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:51.520]   children at home. Infants, two-year-old, five-year-olds. If they're old, maybe about 10 or 11, 12-year-olds.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:57.280]   So they're right in the thick of things, like many of our church families. And yet, they
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:04.360]   leave them behind for periods, and they walk into dangerous places, risking their life
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:13.580]   to share this strange doctrine of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. An individual who
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:19.120]   does not know the life of Christ will never understand that. Why would you risk your life?
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:26.260]   Why would you risk your young children? When the whole world, every decision they make
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:34.180]   is to protect their children, why would you risk that? Until you understand, until you
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.600]   are freed from the bondage of this world, you'll never really fully understand that
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:46.280]   there's more life in death in Christ than all the success that you can muster up in
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:54.480]   this world. They go because the worst tragedy in life is not dying early. The worst tragedy
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.680]   in life is not getting sick and not having food on the table. That is not the worst tragedy
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.440]   in life. If you believe what you and I profess to believe in Scripture, the worst tragedy
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:13.800]   in life is dying without Christ. That's not me. That's not my interpretation. That's not
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:20.560]   breeding community church. That's what all Christians believe and profess. The problem
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:27.760]   is our life and doctrines don't match up. And that's what we're trying to do. That's
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.840]   what discipleship is, is trying to match up our life and our confession so that it would
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:40.080]   be consistent. My prayer this morning as we come to the communion table, that we would,
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:48.960]   again, deeply consider what does his broken body symbolize by the bread and his shed blood
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:55.920]   symbolized by the grape juice? What kind of impact should that have? How consistent is
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:04.640]   my profession in my life? Do I truly believe in the incarnation of Christ, that God himself
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:13.680]   walked in my shoes to set me free? Are you truly free? Have you been set free? Are you
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:19.240]   declaring freedom with your mouth but in your life are living in bondage? So as we open
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:25.040]   up the communion table, I invite you to take some time to seriously reflect and consider.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:34.400]   Lord, help me. Open my eyes to see. I believe. I have weak faith. And so through the communion
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.000]   table, when you are ready, one by one, we ask you to come. And again, if you're on the
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.160]   side, come through the side and go down the middle so that we don't create traffic here.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.960]   And again, we want to remind you that the communion table are for those who have been
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.800]   baptized. If you made a profession of faith and Christ has covered you through his blood,
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.240]   then you are welcome to come because it's, the communion table is more like an anniversary
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.560]   of someone who has been united with Christ. If you don't know that you have been united
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:04.920]   with Christ and you haven't done so, we ask that you would remain in your seat. And if
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:10.260]   God is speaking to you and that maybe you've been at the church all your life and you just
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:15.840]   assume that you're a Christian, but now that the gospel is becoming more clear and you
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:23.320]   realize that that's not it, I really want to encourage you to seek out leaders, seek
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:30.280]   out brothers and sisters in Christ. Ask them, how do I become a Christian? How do I get
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:36.960]   forgiven of my sins? So if you haven't done so, we ask that you guys would sit, just continue
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.000]   to pray and seek and then again, come and talk to us so that we can help you out. And
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.680]   for those of you who are coming to the table, please come with reverence. In fact, in Corinthians,
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   it says, "Those who eat and drink of the blood and of his flesh in an irreverent manner,
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:59.120]   eats and drinks judgment upon himself." In other words, this is sacred. So as you come
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:05.720]   up, again, it's not, nobody earns their way up to the communion table. We humble ourselves
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:10.040]   by acknowledging that we are sinners and that the only hope that we have is the blood of
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:16.120]   Christ. And so as we confess our sins to come up and to celebrate what he has done for us.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:22.560]   So let me read the passage for us before we open up the table. And then as you are ready,
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:32.960]   we invite you to come one by one. First Corinthians 11, 23 says, "For I received from the Lord
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.840]   that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.040]   took bread. And when he had given things, he broke it and said, this is my body, which
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:47.440]   is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. In the same way, he took the cup also after
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:52.040]   supper saying, this cup is a new covenant in my blood. Do this as often as you drink
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:57.320]   it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:06.240]   the Lord's death until he comes." Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray that as we participate
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:13.160]   in this sacred event, that you would sanctify our minds, our thoughts, and our lives. Help
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:19.440]   us Lord God to celebrate your grace. Help us to remember that we live because Christ
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:27.880]   died for us. Help us Lord God to have an attitude of genuine gratitude in our hearts, that everything
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:33.280]   that we do will be an overflow of that mercy you've given us. So I pray that you would
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.440]   anoint this time, may it be a time of blessing to your church. In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:48.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
