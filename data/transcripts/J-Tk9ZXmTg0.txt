[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   [Music]
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Let's do your intro real quick for "Heroes Love."
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   [Music]
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   So, Rachel Click, Hope Green, we'll come together.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   [Music]
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Heroes love, rest as the ocean.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   [Music]
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Okay, so for the sake of time, for "As the Deer," arrangement-wise,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   we're going to go from verse one straight to verse two.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So, same as "His Mercy is Born," we're going to go from verse one to verse two.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   What key is this one in?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   This one's in C, I believe.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Cool.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So, we're going to do verse one to verse two, and then chorus, verse three, chorus, chorus.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Okay?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Okay.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   [Music]
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And then we'll just practice verse one, verse two, one chorus.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   [Music]
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   [Music]
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   [Music]
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   [Music]
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   [Music]
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   One more time, chorus.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   [Music]
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   [Music]
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Joe, could you turn me up on the monitor, the acoustic?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   [Music]
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   [Music]
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Okay, last song, "Living Hope," in B.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So, standard intro, G, C, G, C.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Verse one, verse two.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Chorus, chorus, right?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   We sing the chorus twice.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Verse one, verse two, chorus, chorus.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And then verse three, verse three, chorus, chorus.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   For the ending, I think I sing it slightly different because "Fill With Hope" goes really high.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So, I think I do the...
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   [Music]
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   [Music]
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   All the way.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   [Music]
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   [Music]
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   [Music]
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   [Music]
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   [Music]
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   [Music]
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   [Music]
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So, I think he does the, "Oh God," he goes up.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I just go down.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   [Music]
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   That's what he does.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   [Music]
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Okay, let's do it real quick.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So, Rachel, you start.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   [Music]
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   How great the chasm that lay between us.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   How high the mountain I could not climb.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   In desperation, I turned to heaven.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And spoke your name into the night.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Then through the darkness, your loving kindness
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Tore through the shadows of my soul.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The work is finished, the end is written.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You're my living hope.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   The God of ages, steps down from glory
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   To wear my sin and bear my shame.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   The cross has spoken, I am forgiven.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   The King of kings calls me his own.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Praise the one who set me free.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   You have broken every chain.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   There's salvation in your name.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Praise the one who set me free.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Death has lost its grip on me.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You have broken every chain.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   There's salvation in your name.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   That came the morning that sealed the promise.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Your buried body began to break.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   It's too slow, it drags.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Too slow?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   That's what Rich says.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Huh?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   He says it's too slow.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.040]   I'll try to listen to Rich because I can't see him visually.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.540]   Follow Rich.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.540]   Okay.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.540]   I will.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.300]   I turned around to look at you but I can't see you.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.440]   Can you hear the kick?
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.260]   So Ashley let's not repeat the chorus, that's my bad.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.400]   Let's just go ahead with verse one, verse two chorus.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.120]   We'll just do the chorus once.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   Can you hear the kick?
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.120]   Can you hear the kick?
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   Can you hear that?
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   Okay.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.120]   Okay.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   Then came the morning that sealed the world.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:28.120]   Your buried body began to breathe.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:48.120]   Out of the silent, the roaring lion, deep clear the grave has no claim on me.

[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.900]   Can I have my vocal higher on the monitor?
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.140]   Thanks.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:05.980]   Check.

[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.140]   Can you turn mine a little higher, too?
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.900]   Can you do that in mine, too, please?
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.100]   Hey, so Luke, we're just repeating the chorus
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.140]   the second time around.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.480]   So after verse three, you know how we repeat verse three?
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.560]   We go into the chorus,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.720]   and then we repeat the chorus one more time.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.140]   So on the repeat,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.220]   on the repeat, don't play the minor.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.380]   No minor on the repeat.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.220]   Oh, for--
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:35.880]   It's just B.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   You just play B, and then it goes back into a hallelujah.

[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.960]   Sorry, I can't hear.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.300]   Rachel, what's Luke saying?
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.880]   You know on that last part where you're repeating three times?
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.920]   Are you saying no minor on that?
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.760]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.840]   We're gonna repeat the chorus, right?
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.380]   For the chorus repeat, it's not a minor.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.220]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.040]   And then when you repeat--
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.880]   But after the second time--
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.260]   Minor each time.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.100]   Minor each time, yeah.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.920]   Okay.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.760]   Uh-huh.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.880]   So I'm gonna try just these.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.960]   Let me know.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.840]   They're saying they're going deaf.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.680]   Okay.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.840]   (audience member speaking off mic)
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.680]   Okay, all right.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.500]   You can turn it down.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.640]   Okay, you can lower us.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.340]   I just won't hear myself.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.380]   Tell me if I'm off.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.720]   Yeah, it's fine.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.140]   We can turn it down.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.560]   Yeah, I'll just bring it closer.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.100]   Do you wanna, do you wanna,
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.020]   they said you can turn that one down and bring it closer.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.860]   Or this one.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.560]   Nothing you can do, don't worry.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.400]   Hey, Richard, are you good?
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.640]   Do you have all the stuff that you need?
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.140]   Richard, you're good?
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.860]   Like you got all your drum and everything,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.680]   everything's good?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.600]   For this song, yeah.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.140]   Okay, do you have anything you wanna run through real fast,

[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.400]   We can intro "Here is Love" together.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   "Here is Love" and "His Mercy is More."
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   You said I have a drum solo, right?

[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.300]   You were too slow.

[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.760]   I should just come in, huh?
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.960]   Should I come straight in?
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:18.200]   We're playing the full verse instrumentally,
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.840]   and then I'm going back into the chorus.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.760]   But I mean, we can hold it too, that's fine too.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.920]   Instead of going to the chorus,
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.760]   should we go to verse three?
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.240]   That's like the setup for after verse three anyways.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.120]   Instead of the chorus, should we go to verse three?
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:28.960]   I don't know, I feel like the song's really long.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.920]   Instead of the chorus?
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.600]   Let me think.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.360]   (gentle music)
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.480]   'Cause we just played the whole verse.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.760]   That's true, okay, let's just,
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.320]   I'm gonna hold the D then,
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.360]   and then we'll go to verse three.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.200]   Okay.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.880]   All right, so we're gonna do verse one, verse two.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.000]   So verse one, turn around, verse two,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.360]   chorus, and then the full turnaround of,
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.080]   play through the verse,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.600]   and then we're gonna hold and then go into verse three.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.800]   Okay?
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.880]   So Richard, after verse three,
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:10.840]   after verse three, that's when we do a solo for you.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.120]   Okay?
