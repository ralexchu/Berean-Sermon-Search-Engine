[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, let's open up our Bibles to 1 Corinthians.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   I'm sure you guys are already there.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.600]   Let me open up my Bible.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.720]   And I'm going to start reading from verse 12 down to verse 31.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.320]   And it says, "For even as the body is one, and yet has many members, and all the members
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.840]   of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640]   And by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.920]   slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.120]   For the body is not one member, but many.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.200]   If the foot says, 'Because I'm not a hand, I'm not part of the body,' it is not for this
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.360]   reason any less a part of the body.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.040]   And if the ear says, 'Because I'm not an eye, I'm not a part of the body,' it is not for
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.760]   this reason any less, any the less, a part of the body.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.760]   If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.040]   If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.760]   But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.580]   If they were all one member, where would the body be?
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.000]   But now there are many members, but one body, and the eye cannot say to the hand, 'I have
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.140]   no need of you,' or again the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you.'
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.080]   On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.660]   are necessary.
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.500]   And those members of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.820]   honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.660]   Whereas our more presentable members have no need of it, but God has so composed the
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.700]   body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked, so that there may be no division
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.520]   in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.580]   And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.140]   If one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.220]   Now you are Christ's body and individually members of it.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.580]   And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers,
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.860]   then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.980]   All are not apostles, are they?
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.820]   All are not prophets, are they?
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.580]   All are not teachers, are they?
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.980]   All are not workers of miracles, are they?
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.900]   All do not have the gifts of healing, do they?
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.060]   All do not speak with tongues, do they?
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.740]   All do not interpret, do they?
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.420]   But earnestly desire the greater gifts, and I show you a still more excellent way.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.820]   All right.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.020]   Well, let's take a look at our packet.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.940]   And I asked this question, what do we know from the immediate context so far?
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.940]   Okay?
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.820]   And the reason why I asked that is because we started chapter 12, but it was two weeks
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.900]   ago, three weeks ago.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.440]   And so we need a quick refresher.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.580]   If you would glance over at chapter 12, verses one through 11, we started this conversation
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.580]   of spiritual gifts there.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.100]   And I want to highlight to the fact that chapter 12 all the way to chapter 14, that entire
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.500]   section deals with the gifts of the spirit, spiritual gifts.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   Okay?
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.140]   And what's very interesting is as he starts to talk about them, you can deduce the various
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.020]   problems that are taking place within the church.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.380]   And so in the current context, we know there is confusion.
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.420]   We know there is confusion.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.940]   There's confusion in the worship place, there's confusion in the church, and there's confusion
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.860]   about the spiritual gifts.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.720]   So in chapter 12, verses one through 11, Apostle Paul describes the various character traits
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.980]   of the gifts, and he lists the various gifts that exist.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.220]   Okay?
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.980]   And in so doing, he's going to give the nature of the gifts, but one of the main things that
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.660]   I highlighted to you as a way of review in the last Bible study is the fact that Apostle
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.700]   Paul emphasized what is the source of these gifts.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   Okay?
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.560]   What is the source of these gifts?
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.380]   So if you look at basically almost all the verses, it contains certain phrases that are
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.060]   repeated again and again and again.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.700]   For example, starting from verse four, "There are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.260]   There are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.660]   There are varieties of effects, but the same God."
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.500]   So what you have there is a trinity, the Spirit, the Lord, and God, who are the source of the
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.900]   spiritual gifts to the church.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.940]   Okay?
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.580]   So in so laying down the spiritual gifts, the nature, and the source of it, Apostle
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.340]   Paul in the last time gave a command to the church that these spiritual gifts really were
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.140]   meant to reveal the Spirit's power, and they were to be used for the common good of the
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.140]   church.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.140]   Okay?
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.020]   Now, what we pick up in verse 12, what we pick up in verse 12 is he's going to start
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.740]   to talk about the nature of the church itself.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.700]   So he's began talking about the spiritual gifts, but now he's going to start talking
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.260]   about the nature of the gifts themselves.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.500]   Oh, sorry, the nature of the church.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   Okay?
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.500]   The nature of the church.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:23.140]   And as he's talking about the church, he describes it as one unified body, or unified in one body
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.140]   is what I wrote it.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.140]   Okay?
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.860]   Now, as we take a look at this, let's take a look at verse 12.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.900]   It says, "For even as the body is one, and yet as many members, all the members of the
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.980]   body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ."
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:46.060]   I'm going to ask you what seems to be an obvious question, but it's a trick question.
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:56.540]   What is the emphasis of verse 12?
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.940]   Come on, brave soul.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.100]   Raise your hand and answer the question.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.100]   Any volunteers?
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.860]   Remember, I am not scary.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.380]   And I don't like, if you volunteer and you put your, you know, you risk it, I'm not going
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380]   to hurt you.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.380]   I lay you down easy.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.380]   Yes.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.380]   One body, many members.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.380]   Okay, good.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.380]   One body, many members.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:24.340]   A lot of times you look at this whole section, and chapter 12 has been most frequently preached
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.180]   as like, "We got to be one!"
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.180]   You know?
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.540]   "We got to be united!"
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.780]   And that's typically with, you know, umph and passion, what a preacher would teach this
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.940]   passage as.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.420]   But the fact of the matter is, he's not just emphasizing one half of that picture.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:46.220]   He's emphasizing both the aspect of unity and the variety, that there are many.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.220]   Okay?
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.860]   There is unity and there are the variety.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.980]   And so he uses the analogy or the metaphor of the body.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.700]   And I think that's something really important to highlight.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.820]   Okay?
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.660]   So as I asked the question there, "What abstract truth is Paul highlighting with the church
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.260]   and the body analogy?"
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.900]   You guys can jot those two things in, that there's unified, and yet there are many pieces.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.980]   But here's the more important question as we think about that.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.900]   He's emphasizing this point with the metaphor, you know?
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.900]   But what are the implications?
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.900]   What are the implications of this truth?
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.220]   And I want to ask you guys to take a moment to think about that.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.580]   And I had you guys think about it in your discussion groups.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.580]   Right?
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.580]   Oh.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.580]   I didn't.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.580]   All right.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.980]   Take time to think about it right now.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.740]   Okay?
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.420]   In thinking about the fact that, okay, the church, okay, and talking about the nature
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:53.220]   of the church, we are to be united, we are to be together, one spirit and whatnot, but
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.860]   we are many members.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.900]   And that truth he's highlighting with the analogy of the body.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:05.420]   So if we are truly like a body, what are some of the implications you can draw from that?
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.900]   Just throw them out there.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.900]   Excellent.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   Okay?
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.380]   Let's write some of these down underneath that section.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.620]   Every body part has a different function.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.580]   And that functionality is important because we literally have a role to play.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.700]   Okay?
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.100]   And that's how he describes it later in the passage.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.620]   And that's an emphatic point.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:36.460]   Does not a part of your body have a certain, you know, purpose to it in which it's supposed
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.380]   to be for smell, for sight, for taste and whatnot.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.380]   Okay?
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.380]   What are some other implications?
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:55.300]   I feel like you want to say something.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.940]   Just do it.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.580]   Compliment each other.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.900]   That's absolutely right.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.380]   If you guys have ever hurt one leg, you know that after hurting one leg, the other one's
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.100]   going to start hurting too because you need both.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.900]   You overcompensate and whatnot.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.900]   Right?
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.460]   So there's a sense in which, you know, every piece of the body is necessary because together
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.460]   they work in tandem.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.780]   You know, in tandem.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.220]   They compensate for one another.
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.300]   So that's another important implication.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.140]   I just want a couple more and I'm going to make a point with it.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.140]   Okay?
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.140]   Yes.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.140]   Okay.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.140]   Every part is important.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.140]   Right?
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:43.300]   So there's a sense in which you could think that, I don't know, some parts of the body
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.460]   are like insignificant.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.740]   What it's like.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:52.180]   And typically, I'm not in the medical field so I don't know a whole lot, but a lot of
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.660]   people think the appendix or whatever, you know.
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.020]   But recently they said, "Hey, there is actually a purpose to this."
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:04.940]   And then if I can use another example, just for this study, I Googled importance of the
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.940]   thumb.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.940]   Okay?
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.980]   If you get super bored, it's actually a really interesting thing you could do.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.940]   Just go to Google and just type in importance of the thumb.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.900]   It's really crazy just thinking about your little short stubby thumb.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.900]   Alright?
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:24.100]   That if you did not have this thumb, like, there's so many different tasks, so many different
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.860]   functions you could not do.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.860]   And I love that.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.740]   And I'm going to use that one of these days.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.780]   One of these days if you guys get really discouraged and I'm going to be like, "You're so important
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.780]   to the church."
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.540]   You're like, "My thumb."
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.100]   You might be short, you might be stout compared to the rest.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.820]   I'm short and stout so I can say that, right?
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.820]   But you're super important.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.140]   Because it's absolutely true.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.140]   Okay?
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.740]   Now, the reason why I say this is because he's going to use this analogy to teach the
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.460]   entire congregation that whatever problems they're having, whatever issues they're having
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.860]   with even spiritual gifts, he's going to use this analogy to prove them wrong.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.660]   He's going to use this analogy to say, "This is how God expects you to be."
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.060]   So it's good for us to think through all the implications and to see this.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:19.100]   What's more, this analogy most closely connects us with Christ our Lord.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.820]   Here's an interesting part of verse 12 that I think we should pay attention to.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.820]   If you look at verse 12, it reads, "For even as the body is one and yet has many members,
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.220]   all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.700]   So also is Christ."
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.700]   Okay?
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.380]   Typically, it goes the other way.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.180]   Jesus is like this, so also should you, right?
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.500]   Typically, it goes, Jesus is this character trait, Jesus is like this, and so you should
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.900]   emulate, you should imitate.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.940]   But what's really interesting is he highlights this analogy of the body and says, "So is
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.940]   Christ."
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.540]   Whoa, here's a question for you.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.540]   What do you think he's saying by that?
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.540]   Yes.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.540]   Whoa, wait, sorry.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.540]   It's okay.
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:30.860]   I'm just kidding.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.620]   I just want to make you sweat.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.620]   Good.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:40.660]   So, this aspect of it is contained in, I think, what Apostle Paul's getting at.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:46.980]   Reason why is because this passage actually is, that little segment is so brief that a
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.500]   lot of people have a lot of questions about it, but you're right.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:56.780]   If we were to think about the harmony and the unity that exists, we'd first think of
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.300]   the Trinity.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:03.180]   And what's more, when we talk about husband and wife and that unity, we talk about the
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:10.100]   Trinity because there's that unity that we basically aspire to, the perfect harmony within
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.100]   the Godhead.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.100]   Right?
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.100]   Okay.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.460]   And so, you're absolutely right.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:22.900]   That has a lot to do with it because there is this question of, in what way is his concept
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:28.820]   of Christ connecting with his concept of many but one?
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.820]   Right?
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.820]   Many but one.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.180]   And what I would like for you guys to just kind of jot down is, there is a theological
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:42.460]   concept that's really deep and profound, which is union with Christ.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.020]   Union with Christ.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.460]   Okay?
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.780]   And if you ever get a chance to dig deeper into that theological topic, do it.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.420]   It's going to be glorious.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:14:02.780]   You're going to realize there is this supernatural, God-given miracle to his people in which by
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:08.780]   his power, and only his power, can he make you one with Christ.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.500]   Can he make the church, the entire church, one with the Lord.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   Okay?
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.260]   And in that sense, I think that's why he's talking about, "So also is Christ."
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.660]   Remember that Jesus is the one who taught in John 15, five, "He who abides in me, and
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.380]   I in him, he bears much fruit.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.340]   For apart from me, you can do nothing."
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.540]   And so, the nature of the church, the nature of Christ, the nature of our relationship
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.740]   with God, there is this supernatural union.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.740]   Okay?
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.740]   Supernatural union.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.780]   And I think that's something important to think about.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:49.380]   And because it's getting closer and closer to Thanksgiving, today I'm going to highlight,
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.260]   as we go and study the passage, a couple things that we should super-duper really be thankful
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.260]   for.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.260]   Okay?
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.400]   Let's be thankful for the union with Christ.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.820]   I want you guys to just take a moment to think about that.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.460]   You know?
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.660]   I appreciate when people are there for me.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.780]   Like, I have people to lean on when I'm just dead tired.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.900]   I appreciate, like, a lot of the people that I serve with.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:22.380]   I appreciate that sometimes I feel like, out of all my seminary buddies and the pastoral
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.620]   buddies, I feel like I have the greatest support system ever.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.460]   I've got elders, Pastor Peter, the church, the deacons, the people I serve with in our
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.380]   different ministries and stuff, and I just feel super-supported.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.380]   Okay?
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:38.300]   Now, the reason why I talk about that is because there's a difference between somebody being
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:45.020]   with you, somebody supporting you, somebody seldomly checking up on you, asking you a
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.740]   good question, as opposed to somebody who is one with you.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.780]   As opposed to somebody who is above and beyond just with you, but in you, and you are in
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.780]   Him.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.380]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.860]   That God's presence with us is so much above and beyond what we experience and are encouraged
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.540]   by.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.460]   Let's thank God for that.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.860]   That is a mystery of the gospel, mystery of the Christian truth, that we should really
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.260]   be thankful for.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.620]   That's something done in the power of God.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.620]   Okay?
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:23.940]   So, again, highlighting this idea, Jesus identifies Himself with the church, with the believers.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.620]   Not in such a way with, like, "Yeah, I'm attached to that guy."
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:34.100]   No, like, He identifies Himself in such a way where, in verse 12, it's analogous.
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:39.980]   That the church is literally Him, the expression of His body, right?
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.580]   And that the church, as having Christ as its head, literally is identified, wrapped up
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.220]   in Christ.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.620]   That's something beautiful.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.820]   Alright?
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   Okay.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.940]   Any questions about verse 12 so far?
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.580]   Alright, let's move forward.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.580]   When we look at verse 13, it continues this idea.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:05.100]   It says, "For by one Spirit, we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks,
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:10.620]   whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit."
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.180]   Here and now, here and now, He starts to highlight the unity.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.180]   Okay?
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.620]   He starts to highlight the unity.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.580]   Because remember, verse 12 served as kind of like an intro, and He says, "The emphasis
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.220]   is both, unity and variety."
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.820]   Unity and diversity.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.820]   Okay?
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:33.220]   So here in verse 13, He's highlighting the unity aspect of it.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.980]   And for us, I just want for us to think about that.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.420]   Because what He's highlighting here is, one Spirit, one baptism.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.980]   One Spirit, one baptism.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.860]   Okay?
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.420]   And in this, I just want us to think for a moment.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.820]   The concept of solidarity.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.380]   How many of you guys are from UC Irvine?
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.440]   A bunch.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.540]   We have no school spirit.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.940]   Other schools have a lot of school spirit.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.940]   How many of you guys from like LA?
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.940]   SC!
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.940]   Woo!
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.940]   Okay.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.940]   Case in point.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.940]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.940]   All right.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.940]   All right.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.540]   You guys can just duke it out in the parking lot later.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.340]   My point exactly is, we had like 30 people raise their hand, but it was silent.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.340]   Okay?
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.180]   We had like four people raise their hand, and it was loud.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.100]   The idea is, there's a solidarity just from where you went to school.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.220]   Okay?
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.940]   And obviously, we have solidarity with different stuff.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.300]   We have solidarity because we experience the same sufferings.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.420]   Why do like, I don't know, guys who went to training, like military training together,
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.420]   have such a bond?
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.380]   They shared experience.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.740]   We have solidarity because of skin color.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.740]   Like ethnicity.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.740]   Okay?
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:50.700]   If you have like, you know, Asian pride, if you have, why are you guys all laughing?
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.700]   What?
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.100]   I'm not going to make any racist comments.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.180]   Don't be on edge, right?
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.180]   Just calm down.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.180]   Okay.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.180]   We sometimes...
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.180]   Thanks, Eric.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:12.180]   But, you know, people do have solidarity based on ethnicity.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.180]   And you know what?
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.620]   Although, yeah, we're against racism and all that kind of stuff.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.980]   I mean, people are okay with the fact that sometimes, yeah, if you're from Taiwan, you're
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.620]   like, yeah, Taiwan pride.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.540]   Or if you're from a certain background, you say, yeah.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.100]   That's solidarity.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.500]   Okay?
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.300]   And then, there are deeper ties than that.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   Deeper ties than that.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.460]   And the deeper ties are things like blood.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:41.380]   I love getting introduced to the Brazilian culture through my wife because that culture
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.860]   will do anything for family.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.900]   They will just drop whatever.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.020]   So we get a call Sunday night.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.940]   It's been like, you know, Sundays are really tiring.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.220]   We're dead tired or whatever.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.220]   Last minute.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.220]   Hey, come up to LA.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.220]   We're having dinner.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.220]   I'm like, I'm not going to LA, dude.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.220]   I hate LA, you know?
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.220]   Sorry for those of you guys who said you're from LA.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:03.620]   But I really don't like LA because my personality is I like it calm and I don't like the bustle
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.620]   of the city.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.620]   I hate the traffic.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.620]   I don't want to drive over there.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.620]   But Bia's like, let's go.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.300]   I'm like, what the heck?
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.540]   But then I show up and there's like 40 people there.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.860]   The Brazilian culture is very much like anything for family.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.780]   It's if they need money, if they need a place to crash, if they need food, whatever it is,
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.620]   just drop it and go do it for your family.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.620]   Okay.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.580]   And I kind of envy that because I felt like maybe it's just my family, but we didn't have
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.140]   that kind of solidarity as a family.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:37.980]   If even if you're a cousin, like a distant cousin, certain cultures will fight for you.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.180]   Certain cultures back when I was in high school, you just don't mess with certain cultures
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.820]   because he'll get his brothers, his cousins, his nephews and everybody.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.820]   Right.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.820]   That's just the way it is.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.820]   Okay.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:55.340]   So I want to talk about that because there are certain ties that make you just have solidarity.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:00.860]   Here he's highlighting the fact that not only do you have a shared experience of being baptized
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.380]   by Jesus himself, you were dunked in the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.280]   But now you have in you the spirit living in you.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.060]   So that's even deeper than blood.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.280]   So now you don't even have just a blood tie.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.520]   You have a spiritual tie identifying who you are.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.180]   There should be a sense of unity above and beyond any other superficial thing on this
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.000]   earth.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.060]   Whatever school experience, hardship you went through, yeah, that can build a sense of solidarity.
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:36.220]   But shared experience of being saved from the wrath of God, right?
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.700]   Shared bloodline where we're co-heirs with Christ.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.700]   Shared nature.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.960]   If we're talking about unity, that spiritual aspect of what he's talking about should bring
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.240]   us so close together that we should be one.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   Right?
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.840]   That we should be one.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.440]   And so obviously we know that that doesn't just come naturally in the sense that it doesn't
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.440]   come easy.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.440]   Okay?
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.760]   It doesn't come easy.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.840]   But that's exactly what the Lord desires of us.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.460]   Here's some cross references for you guys in Galatians chapter three, verse 26 through
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.020]   27.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.700]   He says, "For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:24.660]   For all of you who are baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ."
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.720]   And then Ephesians four, four through six, "There is one body and one spirit just as
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.780]   also you were called and one hope of your calling.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.820]   One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.120]   all and in all."
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.120]   Right?
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.500]   So think about that.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.380]   How much he's emphasizing this fact that we should have this kind of unity.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.660]   And I just want to again take a moment to get God thanks as we think about that kind
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.540]   of stuff.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:00.820]   I just mentioned that we have both shared experience, shared identity, shared bloodline.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:10.740]   Now, as I was reading one of the commentators, it made me stop because he said, "God has
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:19.700]   given us the absolute best to which there is no more for him to give."
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.340]   It's an interesting statement.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.300]   It's an interesting statement.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.540]   And I want you guys to think about that for a moment and see if that sits okay with you,
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.380]   if you have any issues with that.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:34.820]   If that strikes you as weird or wrong and why.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.660]   Okay?
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:43.220]   There's a statement, "God has nothing better to give us.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.220]   He's given us his best."
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:54.500]   What do you guys think?
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:12.580]   Correct statement, incorrect statement, and why?
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:17.580]   So I wanted to use that point as a means of giving thanks to God.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.260]   And then, obviously I'm making a kind of a tricky question about, is this statement right
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.260]   or wrong?
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.900]   "God has nothing better to give us."
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:32.220]   But I want to use this opportunity to say, when we think about that which unites us,
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.740]   it's simply the person of God indwelling us, right?
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:42.740]   And there's a sense to which, yeah, God is already ours and he's left his presence in
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.700]   us.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.300]   And this truth that God is in us, that he's so close to us, and this truth that what he's
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:56.300]   given is himself, there's a huge sense in which the answer is yes.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.420]   But he has an inheritance to give us, yes, but he's given us already what's best.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.940]   But he has heaven to give us, yes.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.900]   He has immortality to give us, yes.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:16.740]   But there's a supreme truth to which he's already given us what's best, his spirit that
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.140]   unites us, right?
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.220]   And so that statement, I kind of glossed over initially, but then it made me stop when I
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.220]   read it in the commentary.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.820]   I was like, "Dude, this guy has deep insight into the spiritual reality of the fact God
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.780]   has given us his spirit, okay?
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.700]   God has given us his spirit."
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.180]   So let's really make sure to give thanks to God for those things.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.080]   All right.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:48.540]   So that being done, verses 12 to 13, okay, emphasizing both the unity and diversity,
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:54.020]   and verse 13 emphasizing the type of unity we should have in the spirit.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.020]   Let's move forward.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.020]   Verse 14 through 17.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.660]   Can I have, let's see, Mitchell, since you're right in front of me, can you read out loud
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.660]   verse 14 through 17 for us?
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:09.660]   "For the body is not one member but many.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:24.160]   If the foot says, 'Because I'm not a hand, I'm not a part of the body,' it is not for
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.460]   this reason any less a part of the body.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.460]   And if the ear says, 'Because I'm not an eye, I'm not a part of the body,' it is not for
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.460]   this reason any less a part of the body.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.460]   If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:33.900]   The whole we're hearing, where would the sense of smell be?"
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   Okay, thank you.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.900]   All right.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:41.780]   So as you look at that, now as he's already talked about the unity, he is talking about
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.780]   the diversified body, right?
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:49.380]   I call it the diversely unified body, okay?
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.780]   In this passage, another commentary said an interesting statement.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.840]   He says, "The Corinthian church was divided where it should have been united and tried
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.420]   to be uniform where it should have been diverse."
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:09.860]   And there's one way to which the attitude of looking at the diversity was wrong.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.060]   Can you guys just, it's kind of obvious in the text, but can you guys identify what is
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:30.520]   the problem or the error in thinking about spiritual gifts in the Corinthian church?
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:38.280]   How about, pick on Jen, John.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.660]   Okay, so what's the problem in the church?
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.240]   When you look at that, what can you deduce about the error of their thinking?
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:54.640]   That either they're putting certain gifts above others, and they're not this, they're
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   not that.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.640]   They're thinking of themselves.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   Okay.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   Yeah, good.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.440]   So it's just kind of this thinking of, he says, well, they're trying to start, they
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.600]   started to stack different gifts, you know, tier it up, and then if you were on the bottom,
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.640]   you're like, "Nah, I'm not that important.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.680]   I'm like a half member, pseudo member.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.880]   I don't have much to offer.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.400]   Boo hoo, woe is me, nobody needs me.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.040]   I'm going to be out of here."
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   Right?
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.080]   It's this kind of self-pity attitude of like, "I don't have this, and I'm not eloquent
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   as this guy."
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.680]   And to tell you truthfully, honestly, I'm like that.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.360]   So I get really convicted by this passage.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.040]   Okay.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.560]   But here's the problem with that kind of thinking, you know, is even though we're grown adults,
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.040]   sometimes we throw pity parties.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.080]   I'm only a foot, you know, I'm not even a thumb, I'm like the toe, you know.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.360]   Or some kind of other pity parties is like, "I can't do what they do," you know.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:56.940]   Or they start to, through their rationale, not only say that they're like insignificant,
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.360]   they start to demean their value, and so they say, "And so I don't belong."
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.800]   I mean, that's the judgment that's bad, right?
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.480]   It's not so much that, "Oh, like identifying that I don't have skill," because reality
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.180]   is some of us aren't as skilled as others.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.520]   Reality is we all don't have same gifts.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.800]   Reality is some gifts are bigger, some gifts are smaller, some gifts are more pronounced,
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:25.280]   you know, more noticeable, perhaps in humanistic sense, it's more glorious or whatnot, it's
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.640]   more performance-oriented.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.100]   So the truth of the matter is there is a difference of gifts.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.440]   But then the judgment, that's where it went all sour.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.920]   "I don't belong."
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:45.620]   Now, my question to you is, what would be the ramification if we allowed people to think
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.000]   like that?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.680]   Because I only have this, I don't belong.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:57.540]   What would be the consequence maybe of you thinking like that?
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:12.180]   Okay, excellent.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.180]   Just throw them out.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.460]   This isn't a question that doesn't have wrong or right answers, but you're absolutely right.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:21.460]   I think one of the results of that is you're not serving as you ought to.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.500]   God gave us a commission for the church, he gave us responsibility in the church, and
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:33.100]   just because you say, "I don't have enough, so I'm not going to do it," that's you ditching
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.020]   your responsibility.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:40.860]   So yes, it's true that sometimes people are discouraged, so we don't want to be more heavy
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.780]   on them, but the reality is, yeah, if you're so discouraged, you're not doing even the
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:51.660]   small things you're responsible for, or that you could do, that's ditching your responsibility.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.660]   What else?
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.660]   Oh yes, Michael?
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:31:04.660]   I sit here, in your eyes, you would elevate people above their station.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.660]   Okay.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.420]   Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.900]   So he was saying you'd elevate other people.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:14.780]   The whole paradigm kind of hurts the church, where you elevate other people who you think
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.180]   are, "Oh, they're so cool," you know?
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.580]   "Oh, they're so awesome," and stuff.
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.740]   And I think when the church paradigm starts to do that, when you start having this hierarchy,
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:30.720]   when you start having this, it's just a bad paradigm to have for the church.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.380]   And I think there's a sense in which, yeah, there's churches that can do that.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.500]   I mean, even our church could be susceptible of doing that.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:43.100]   If you raise certain people because of their performance, you don't value them based on
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.380]   their true spiritual character, but because of their gifts.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:50.460]   And you start to evaluate who's valuable, who's more worthy, who should receive more
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.620]   honor based on their contribution and production for the church.
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:58.180]   I mean, what have we become then?
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:03.380]   And on the flip side of that, yeah, then what you feel is now even projected on the other
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:08.220]   people who feel like that, who think, "I am only a half member.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.140]   I'm not really valuable here."
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.820]   And just, that kind of upsets me, you know?
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.700]   Because I remember there was a, I don't know if I've ever told this story, but I went with
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:25.100]   my dad to his church, and his church was highly charismatic in the practicing of gifts and
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.900]   stuff, and I'm not going to go into that here now.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.420]   But one of the things that happened was they were trying to get everybody to do a certain
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.740]   gift, speaking in tongues, namely.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.420]   And one of the pastors was going around trying to impart this gift onto other people.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.700]   And he came to my dad, and my dad was praying, and then he started to lay his hand on my
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.980]   dad and started to pray all fervently, and I was just kind of watching this thing.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.660]   And then I was just confused because I was younger, and I was just like, "What's this
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.660]   guy doing?"
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.940]   And then this guy started really trying, so he started shaking my dad's head, he grabbed
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:59.020]   my dad's arms, he raised him up, and he started doing all this stuff, but my dad couldn't
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.020]   do it.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.940]   And I said, "Okay, it's kind of time for you to move on."
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.540]   At the end of the service, my dad and I were driving back home, and my dad looked all sad,
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.660]   all dejected, and he said, "I just couldn't do it.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.980]   I guess the Spirit wasn't with me, and I just almost flipped a lid."
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:21.940]   I was like, "Shame on the church that makes a man feel like he's insignificant or doesn't
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.060]   have the Spirit because he couldn't say stuff."
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:32.020]   But you're right, if you function in that paradigm, then you create a culture of that
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:37.860]   paradigm where people are assessed and your spirituality is assessed simply by your production
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.860]   and performance.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:45.580]   What's our other ramifications if you allow people to think this way?
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.100]   Exclusion.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.620]   Good.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.860]   Exclusion in the church.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.940]   So you can see that there's a lot of bad ramifications.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.740]   Another one I want to highlight is continued arrogance.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.160]   So a big part of the reason I say continued is remember the big problem in the Church
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.240]   of Corinth was their pride.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.420]   From the beginning it was, "I'm with this leader.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.060]   I'm with that leader."
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.540]   From the beginning it was, "I want to be here.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.780]   I want to be there."
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.220]   It was this trying to one-up each other.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:25.780]   But in the end, even though they're having a pity party, that too can be because of pride.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:31.420]   "I want it to be like this, but I'm like this, so forget it."
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.860]   It's not just discouragement.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:37.860]   Sometimes underneath all that could be arrogance inside, and that's just as dangerous.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.780]   Here's another thing.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:45.260]   You go against the design of God, and this is the biggest thing.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.420]   You go against the directive of God.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.340]   You're not just simply being disruptive to the church.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.860]   You're not simply being disruptive to your own growth because of your arrogance, but
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:01.860]   you can be disruptive to the plan of the Lord, which God will not allow.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:07.140]   Because if you look at the passage, there are various points to which it describes that
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.340]   God is the one at work in the church giving these spiritual gifts.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:17.060]   Take for example verse 18, "But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.100]   body just as he desired."
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.940]   Whoa, did you ever think about that?
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:28.100]   I'm not going to get all mystical and be like, "The Lord has a wonderful plan for you, and
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.780]   you were here because of the sovereign will of God, and don't you ever leave."
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.900]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.420]   You're like, "You guys can't ever leave because God placed you here, and you're now forever
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.420]   lifers."
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.060]   That's not true.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.500]   But this passage is so clear, explicit.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.980]   God is the one who builds the church.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:56.140]   So I can say this much, God has sovereignly brought you here.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:00.300]   God has blessed this church with you.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.260]   And I think that's something to be cherished.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.780]   I think that's something to be accepted.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.480]   I think that's something to be recognized, and then obeyed.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.660]   To have the kind of attitude that they have, I think you can call that also perhaps disobedience.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.020]   So I would like to take a moment to thank God.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.300]   Let's take another moment to thank God.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.300]   Think about this.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:31.460]   I mean, that God is intricately placing us in the church.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:36.860]   He's providing and blessing the church with the church.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.860]   And as I think about that, it's like, "Man, thank you, God.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   Thank you that you created us."
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:49.220]   And then we were decaying, sinful, fallen people, but you resurrected us in Christ,
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:54.220]   and then you built us up, and then you placed us in the church, and then you equipped us,
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:59.180]   and you commissioned us, and then you thought us worthy enough to carry out your purpose
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.780]   and plan in the church.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.100]   Thank you, God.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.860]   That's pretty crazy stuff if you think about it.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:16.420]   But again, just kind of summarizing that point, the church is unified and diversified, and
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.260]   to go against the kind of diversity that God has ordained in the church, that would be
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:24.620]   going against the plan and design of the Lord.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.740]   Next passage.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.460]   Next passage.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:33.460]   Let's take a look at verse 20 through 27.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:40.460]   If I could have ... Chris, can you read that?
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:38:06.460]   "As it is, there are many parts to that one body that I cannot see in the head.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:13.460]   But God has so composed his body, that it is greater honor to depart that body, as there
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.460]   may be no division of body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   If one member suffers, all suffer together.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.460]   If one member is honored, all enjoy together."
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.460]   27.
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.460]   Yeah, just read 27 too.
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.460]   "But you are a body of Christ, and a division of members of it."
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.460]   Excellent, thank you.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:40.460]   So, if you guys get ... I think the thrust of the application for this is a perspective.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:48.180]   Remember I was saying that this body analogy is so important, that emphatic verse 27, "Now
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:53.380]   you are Christ's body, and individually members of it," that's a perspective he's teaching
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.380]   you.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.500]   The application is going to go forth from that, but that's a perspective he is teaching
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.500]   you.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:04.580]   And the way that I would like for us to think about it is, mutual dependence.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.940]   We're mutually dependent on each other.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.460]   Think about this body.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.940]   For the individual who thought, "I'm not a part of the body," well listen, if you cut
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:20.820]   off a piece of the body, what happens to that piece?
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.860]   Does it become another body?
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.860]   You know?
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.780]   Is it like one of those mutants where you cut it off and it's like bloop, and then it
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.780]   becomes another person?
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.140]   No, it dies.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.700]   It needs the body.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:39.300]   But furthermore, when the body loses its limb, is it going to be the same?
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.300]   No.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.940]   That body needs the member.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.500]   That's mutually dependent.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.500]   Okay?
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.820]   "You are Christ's body, and all individual members of it."
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:55.380]   So, he starts talking about this whole idea of, "Hey, if you have this second bad attitude,
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.100]   you know, I don't need you.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.340]   You're just a foot.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:03.700]   And you're all arrogant, and you think you have sufficient enough gifts to sustain your
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.060]   body by yourself.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.060]   You're just blind."
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.060]   Okay?
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.060]   "You're just blind."
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.140]   He says, "No, you need each other."
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.660]   And then there's a repeated question.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.460]   Do you notice the repeated question?
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:23.140]   What's the repeated question that he keeps asking as he's trying to teach them about
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:30.300]   this body analogy?
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:43.900]   Anyone?
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.780]   There's this question where he asks, "Where would the body be?"
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.780]   Right?
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.220]   He asks this question, like, "Hey, where would be the sense of smell?
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.780]   Where would be the sense of sight?"
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.820]   That's individual member.
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.700]   And then he asks, "Where would the body be?"
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.780]   Think about the impact it has.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.780]   Right?
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.700]   Think about the impact it has on the whole congregation, on the whole body.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:12.420]   And so, the whole idea here is, I think, in this relationship, there is this mutual dependence.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.940]   And I love when he gets more specific in terms of the relationships in the church.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:23.300]   And if you start looking at verse 25 and 26, this is what it says, "So that there may be
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.500]   no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.500]   And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:37.060]   If one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.500]   I think that's awesome.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.240]   It's such a good goal to strive for.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:49.740]   It's something really to think about, you know, that we absolutely need each other,
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.100]   you know, that we absolutely need each other.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:58.700]   That to have a perspective where there's a sense to which, yeah, let's say there was
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.660]   somebody who was being really problematic in the church.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.320]   Somebody who was creating a rift.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.340]   Somebody who was hard to deal with.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.260]   Somebody who just made church life hard.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:15.440]   I'm not looking at any one of you, I'm just looking at the ceiling.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.880]   Typically speaking, our natural humanistic response would be, it'd be so much easier
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.960]   if they just were not here.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.620]   But we can't have that attitude.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.440]   We can't have that attitude, right?
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.360]   And if you think about this, I just want to ask you to think about, isn't that a beautiful
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:38.200]   picture to be able to hurt together, be honored together, and rejoice together?
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.680]   And then think about this, think about the kind of investment and the perspective it
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.600]   would take for us to do that with each other.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.220]   That's the kind of stuff like lifelong friends say to each other.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:53.400]   After having invested everything, overcome each other's annoyances, been frustrated with
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.360]   each other, forgiven each other, reconciled, and lived long together, and said, "I hurt
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.240]   with you, I feel you."
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.660]   But realize that that's what God is striving for in the church.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.060]   And I hope that we can all buy into that perspective.
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:15.840]   This church community is so important that I literally need these people.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.000]   And not to boast or whatever, but they need me.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.160]   I need to serve, I need to be here, I need to be engaged, I need to be present.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:29.240]   I think that's the kind of perspective that the Lord would desire of us.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:35.080]   And then moving forward, moving forward, in verse 30 and 31, he says, he starts asking,
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:42.120]   you know, that, or he teaches that more specifically in the church, so moving away from the body
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.120]   analogy, in the church, God has appointed and designed that there would be all these
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   different gifts.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.160]   And he says not every single person does all these gifts, and neither does everybody do
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.200]   one gift.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:02.020]   And then he starts asking various questions, and then in verse 31 he says, "But earnestly
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:08.240]   desire the greater gifts, and I show you still more," wait, what?
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.520]   I show you a still more excellent way.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.340]   Sorry, I skipped an article and then I started reading funny.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:22.880]   Verse 31, focusing on verse 31, I want to ask you guys, what is the command here?
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.040]   What are the greater gifts?
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.360]   What is the more excellent way?
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.620]   What do you guys think?
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:37.320]   One more time?
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.560]   Gifts that do more to build a church.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.000]   Good.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.040]   Other things?
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   Other ideas?
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   Yes.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.040]   I love it when you volunteer your friend.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.040]   Love?
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   Okay, excellent.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   Good.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:10.040]   I hope you guys can meditate and think about this for a moment, you know.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   Yes, to both the sisters who answered, chapter 13 he's going to start talking about love,
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   right?
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.640]   And not only that, but there are these many, many gifts that Apostle Paul just listed,
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.960]   and then he starts talking about there is this greater way, a more excellent path.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.240]   And yes, perhaps he's talking about harmony and love.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.960]   Perhaps he's talking about the kind of gifts that create what he just is envisioning.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:43.480]   The kind of gifts that strive to build that body of Christ that's so connected, where
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.120]   each person is doing their work, each person is fulfilling their role, but they're all
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.400]   joined together, not seeing themselves as any better than the rest, but constantly giving
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.720]   each other greater honor, right?
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.640]   So anyway, you guys can keep thinking about that.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.720]   Let's just wrap up with thinking about this.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:06.680]   I just want to give an encouragement, you know.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.720]   If you guys, you know, sometimes wonder, like, I don't know, like that sounds good, but I
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.480]   just don't even know what God's will is for me, you know.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:20.880]   Like I don't know what to do and stuff like that, but sometimes just having this paradigm
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.880]   and buying into this vision of I want to help build this church, I want to help build this
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:32.960]   community, a lot of times it comes from simply your own individual faith and worldview.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:38.160]   Your own individual faith and worldview is going to create a culture in this church.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.600]   Your own individual faith and worldview and your paradigm is going to create a structure
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   around you.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.720]   It's going to create an environment, an aura around you, expectations you have, the way
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.040]   you value things.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.760]   It's going to influence the relationships you have and every single one of you is going
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:57.560]   to have that kind of influence, at least to a pocket of the church, right?
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.760]   So I hope you guys can buy into the vision that Apostle Paul is giving.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:06.320]   I hope you guys can have that kind of perspective that he's trying to teach, because insofar
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.480]   as now what we've learned in this passage, he hasn't given a specific tangible thing,
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.800]   now go do this.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.120]   What he said is, you are the body of Christ, right?
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:21.040]   All right, let's take a moment to pray.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.400]   Father God, we want to thank you so much for your grace.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:30.000]   Lord, as we paused momentarily at different points tonight, we just realized sometimes,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.200]   although we feel like you're far, God, you are so meticulously involved in our lives.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.360]   Thank you, God, that you're constantly building us up individually and that you're also building
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.840]   up the church.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.840]   Thank you, God, that you are investing into your body.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.920]   Father, we thank you, God, that you are also gifting us for your service.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:54.160]   We pray, God, that we would be humble servants, desiring to carry out your purposes, to be
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.800]   about your business, to desire to see your kingdom come.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.400]   Father, we again want to thank you, and I pray that throughout the whole week we'd be
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.760]   encouraged and challenged, and Lord, that the words that we study tonight would reside
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:11.040]   with us, help us just not to be forgetful, but to retain the things that you would have
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040]   us to learn.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.040]   We thank you, God, that the spirit is with us, and I pray for all of us that we would
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:22.160]   have strength for our work, our classes, our family lives, and God, that we would operate
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.960]   and abide by your strength.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   Amen.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.920]   Amen.
