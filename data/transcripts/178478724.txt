[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (Pause)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.300]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans 6.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.400]   We're going to be mainly focused on verse 8-11,
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.260]   but let's read from verse 5-11 this morning.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.700]   Reading out of the ESV,
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.960]   "For if we have been united with Him in a death like His,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.800]   we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.160]   We know that our old self was crucified with Him
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.800]   in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.700]   so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.600]   For one who has died has been set free from sin.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.200]   Now if we have died with Christ,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.700]   we believe that we will also live with Him.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400]   We know that Christ being raised from the dead
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.460]   will never die again.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.060]   Death no longer has dominion over Him.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.760]   For the death He died, He died to sin once for all.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.000]   But the life He lives, He lives to God.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.900]   So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.860]   and alive to God in Christ Jesus."
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.060]   Let's pray.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.600]   Heavenly Father, we thank You again for this morning.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.100]   We pray, Father God, that You would anoint Your Word,
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.700]   You would soften our hearts, open our ears,
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.360]   and we pray, Lord God, that as we have come to worship You,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.400]   that it would truly be from the bottom of our hearts.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.840]   I pray that Your name may be exalted,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.040]   that Your children may be able to hear from You,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.160]   and You alone.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.660]   We thank You in Jesus' name, we pray.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.100]   Amen.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.500]   You know, years ago when I was young in marriage,
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.660]   I think I was about two or three years in marriage,
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.400]   there was a guy that I knew
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.160]   who was about 12 years ahead of me in marriage,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.600]   and he asked me how my marriage was,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.360]   and I told him, "Things are good."
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.300]   And I remember him not being satisfied with that answer,
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.560]   saying, "Peter, you have to really share,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.600]   you know what I mean?
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.560]   What are the struggles that you're going through?"
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.300]   And I remember having that conversation,
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.800]   thinking, "Wow, is this how most people
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.900]   have been married for a while?
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.200]   Is this how they feel about marriage?"
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.000]   And sad to say, in our generation,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.500]   people who've been married for more than a few years,
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.860]   don't have, again, generally,
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.000]   I'm not saying every single person,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.060]   but generally speaking, don't have a high view of marriage.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.000]   In fact, it's pretty strange.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.060]   If you are in a workplace filled with non-Christians,
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.360]   and sad to say, sometimes even Christians,
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.960]   it's strange to talk about your wife in a positive light.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.160]   It's one thing to talk about it here up in the pulpit,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.260]   but when you're out on the streets or in the gym,
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.460]   and you're talking about, "Yeah, my wife is the best.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.860]   She does this and that."
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.260]   And almost kind of like, "You're a weirdo."
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.360]   You expect men to be ripping on their wives,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.320]   "Oh, that ball and chain, because of her,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.760]   I can't do this and I can't do that."
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.460]   And you typically hear wives talking about their husbands
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.020]   like they're training monkeys.
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.560]   You know, they got to train them to do this,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.760]   and train them to do that.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.620]   And that's a typical language that you hear
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.000]   of people who've been married for a certain period of time.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.700]   And it's sad, but that is the reality that we live in.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.160]   And sometimes, I think part of the reason why that happens
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.960]   is, I think if you've been in a marriage for a while,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.200]   you forget why you decided to get together.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.720]   Nobody had a gun to your head and say,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.420]   "You better marry this girl."
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.600]   Everybody gets married because they want to get married.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.520]   In fact, a lot of people get married,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.700]   despite the opposition from parents, from friends,
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.700]   because they wanted to.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.760]   They wanted this more than anything else.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.560]   If you remember, but for whatever the reason,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.520]   time passes by and you forget about that,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.960]   and then it becomes a burden.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.620]   It's important for us, and that's why we have anniversaries,
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.580]   that's why we have different days that we set aside
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.060]   to remember the gift that God has given in our marriage.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.720]   But I think this morning, my point is not talking
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.980]   about marriage, but a lot of times in our walk with God,
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.780]   our relationship with God is perceived the same way.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.520]   When you see somebody on fire for God,
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.480]   we just assume they're a young Christian.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.380]   They're young in faith or young in age,
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.820]   but rarely do you see somebody who's been walking
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.860]   with the Lord for 30, 40 years on fire for God.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.560]   It's just strange.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.580]   You expect people who've been in the church
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.520]   for a long time to be jaded, kind of lukewarm.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.360]   And again, it's a very strange scene.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.660]   And I think part of the reason why we do that
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.280]   is because sometimes Christianity in our walk with God
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.420]   becomes nothing more than things that we need to do.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.160]   We have things we need to do at work, things to do at home,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.920]   and then there's things we need to do at church.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.380]   So sometimes you may be thinking that maybe
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.080]   if I didn't meet Christ, I would have less of a burden
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.660]   in life than maybe my secular friends.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.260]   We've been talking about how Paul is trying to convince,
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.520]   as he is preaching the gospel here in Book of Romans,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.060]   that every single person who has been united with Christ,
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.500]   first and foremost, have been united with his death.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.400]   That as Jesus was crucified, we were crucified with him.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.200]   And that's absolute truth.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.600]   He says every Christian who genuinely confessed their faith
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.500]   has been crucified with Christ.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.800]   But if the gospel stops there, it would be a tragedy.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.760]   You know, a lot of times we think about Christian life
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.840]   as sacrifice, picking up the cross.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.540]   He died, we need to suffer.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.800]   We need to become the servant of all,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.100]   consider others better than ourselves.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.040]   And we think about all these commandments
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.660]   that are straight out of the Bible,
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.600]   but if we don't understand why these things are taught
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.400]   and what the purpose of these things are,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.040]   and that's where we stopped.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.900]   That all we do is to celebrate Christ crucified,
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.760]   not realizing or celebrating what happens after.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.400]   He is buried, he is resurrected on the third day,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   and he is glorified.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.860]   And then he tells his church that one day,
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.200]   the same will happen to us.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.740]   That if we are united with Christ in his death,
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.800]   we will also be united with him in his life.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.700]   But if we stop at the death and not recognize the life,
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.940]   that's when Christianity becomes a drudgery.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.500]   Because we're not experiencing the life,
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.800]   all we're experiencing is sacrifice.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.460]   See, the text that we're looking at this morning,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.800]   verse 8, after he's established
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.360]   that we've clearly been crucified with Christ,
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.100]   starting from verse 8, he says,
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.900]   "The reason for this,
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.040]   "the reason why we were united with Christ in his death
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.600]   "is because we have been united with his resurrected life."
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.000]   So look with me in verse 8.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.440]   Romans 6, 8 says, "Now, if we have died with Christ,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.100]   "we believe that we will also live with him."
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.560]   So I wanna make this very clear.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.840]   We're not at the imperatives yet.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.940]   This is not a command.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.800]   Paul has not given a single command up to this point.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.300]   We're gonna get to that when he gets to verse 11.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.500]   Starting from verse 11,
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.200]   he's gonna go to the imperatives,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.160]   and he's gonna say,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160]   "Now that you know what it means to be a Christian,
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.460]   "now you ought to do this."
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.860]   So starting from verse 11,
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.260]   he's going to give imperatives, commandments.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.740]   Therefore, this is how you ought to live.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.660]   But up to that point, up to this point,
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.940]   he's just giving theological truths,
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.500]   that this is a fact.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.400]   So when he says,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.900]   "If we've truly been crucified with Christ,
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.600]   "we believe,"
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   we believe that we will also live with him.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.560]   He's stating a belief.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.500]   The question that we need to ask in this is,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.300]   is he talking about this belief that leads to life?
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.500]   Is he talking about that one day when we die,
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.640]   and we're gonna be resurrected with him in eternity,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.860]   and we're gonna live?
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.760]   Or is he talking about living as in,
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.840]   because we died with him,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.900]   we're able to live in a certain way today?
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.300]   I hope you understood what I was saying.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.860]   Douglas Moo, who's the leading scholar
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.060]   in the book of Romans,
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.940]   this is how he describes that question.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.000]   He says in his commentary,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.300]   "This future life of the resurrection
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.600]   "casts its shadow into the believer's present experience,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.500]   "and it's clear from the sequel
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.440]   "that Paul wants us to see the present implication
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.100]   "of this promise of future resurrection life."
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.240]   So some of you guys understood that.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.340]   Some of you guys looking at me like, what?
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.460]   Let me put it in layman's terms.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.020]   Basically what he's saying is,
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.800]   that promise of the future resurrection of Christ
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.600]   casts such a shadow in a Christian's life
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.580]   that it has no other way
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.980]   other than to make a radical impact
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.180]   in the life of the way that Christian lives.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.140]   You didn't understand either.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:32.020]   Basically, this hope of the resurrection
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.060]   makes a radical impact in your life.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.680]   The hope that you have changes the way that you live.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.500]   That's true in every other aspect of our lives.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.260]   Some of you guys are trying to get into grad school.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.740]   And as a result of that, you got a cheap job.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.860]   You're getting minimum wage,
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.240]   and you're working 10, 20 hours, right?
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.340]   As an intern somewhere,
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.220]   and your other college friends who graduated college,
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.060]   and they're making 60, 70,000 a year,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.340]   and you're making minimum wage,
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.540]   and the question is, why are you doing that?
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.380]   You're doing that to build up your resume
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.660]   in hopes that if you put in your time,
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.360]   that somehow that's gonna help you get into,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.040]   whether it's med school or PA school,
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.600]   whatever that you're trying to get into.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.440]   So that hope of getting into that school
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.320]   is causing you to make some sacrifices today.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.400]   We do that in every other part of life.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.340]   Some of you guys have a picture of what your body,
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.520]   you want your body to look like, right?
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.800]   You have a very, you watch certain commercials,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.840]   and you go to the gym, you say, that's what I want.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.360]   And so you're making sacrifices today.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.280]   You're not eating pizza.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.360]   Every time you go to Costco,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.320]   you smell that hot dog, you run out.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.920]   You're making some serious sacrifices in your life,
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.720]   and there's this desire that you have
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.680]   that you're not caving into.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.720]   You're miserable.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.560]   But you're willing to be miserable
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.860]   because of the hope of the new body.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.300]   You're making all kinds of sacrifices.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.920]   You're getting up early, you're going to the gym,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.120]   and you're willing to bear with some of these sacrifices
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.340]   because of the hope that one day
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.400]   your body's gonna look different.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.480]   We practice that in every other aspect of our life,
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.880]   and the greater the hope,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.840]   the greater the impact that it has on our daily life.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.920]   There is no greater hope that any Christian confesses
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.260]   than the hope of a new life in Christ.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.440]   That death is not final.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.520]   That one day we're gonna be in eternity
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.080]   with our Abba Father.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.960]   And that hope changes us.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.240]   It changes not just the way we think,
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.760]   not just the songs that we sing,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.400]   not just the church that we attend.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.000]   It changes every aspect of our lives.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.880]   I think John says this even better.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.360]   In 1 John 3, 2-3, it says,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.320]   "Beloved, we are God's children now,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.860]   "and what we will be has not yet appeared."
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.760]   The promises that God has made,
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.400]   we know it in our head, but we haven't really seen it yet.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.240]   But we know that when He appears,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.360]   "We shall be like Him,
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.560]   "because we shall see Him as He is."
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.200]   We've gotten a glimpse of what that eternal life
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.920]   will be like when we saw Christ.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.280]   He says, "And everyone who thus hopes in Him
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.480]   "purifies himself as he is pure."
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.880]   So everyone who genuinely has this confession,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.760]   genuinely is living with that hope,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.160]   in other words, he says, it changes him.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.120]   It sanctifies him.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.400]   And that's what he means.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.160]   Those who have been united with Christ in His death,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.080]   believe that we will also be united with Him,
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.720]   therefore we will be changed.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.120]   Now, why is he saying this?
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.840]   He's saying this because,
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.640]   remember, the context in which Paul is saying this is
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.840]   to answer the question that came up in verse one.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.200]   Paul has been preaching in the Book of Romans
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.360]   that salvation is by grace alone.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.920]   It is not by your good deeds.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.640]   That if you are under the law, you'll be judged with the law.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.720]   If you don't have the law, you'll be judged outside the law.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.480]   But all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.240]   And salvation is by grace and by faith alone.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.600]   So the natural question is, to a Jew,
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   if that's the case, isn't that going to cause licentiousness?
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.320]   Isn't that going to cause people who say,
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.760]   you know what, one saved always saved,
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.720]   and he's gonna forgive sin, so it doesn't matter what I do.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.320]   Well, Paul answers that question in verse one.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.360]   What shall we say then?
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.000]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.640]   And the answer is, by no means, absolutely not.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.520]   I know some of you guys may be thinking,
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.600]   it's like, hmm, that sounds good on paper,
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.000]   but that's not the reality.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.320]   That sounds good on paper theologically.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.000]   That makes a good sermon, but is that really the reality?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.280]   Hasn't salvation by grace produced cheap grace?
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.960]   Hasn't salvation, if you look at the Jehovah Witnesses,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.160]   and if you ask them, are you assured
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.000]   that you're gonna go to heaven?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.600]   They say, no, they can't.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.880]   I'm not sure if my work is good enough.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.320]   Same thing with the Muslims.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.600]   If you ask them, are you assured?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.120]   They can't be, because they don't know.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.880]   Once they die, if they're good, it's going to outweigh the bad.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.120]   So they work hard.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.480]   They pray.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.840]   They fast.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.560]   They go door to door and get rejected
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.280]   because they have to do this
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.240]   in order to have at least even a little bit of assurance
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.900]   that they may be, after they die, go to heaven.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.900]   But if you give assurance of salvation to just everybody,
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.760]   if you just believe,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.600]   isn't that going to produce licentiousness?
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.240]   Paul says, absolutely not.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.160]   And here's why.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.600]   If they have been truly crucified with Christ,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.980]   so he's not talking about Christianity
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.440]   as you and I may know it in our generation, right?
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.840]   So I want you to get that out of your head.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.820]   Don't just, what Paul is saying
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.860]   is not defending modern day Christianity.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.840]   That's not what Paul is doing.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.100]   Paul is defending genuine Christianity.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.100]   He's defending genuine preaching of the gospel
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.620]   and genuine repentance.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.940]   That's what he's defending.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.660]   So don't just automatically sit there and think,
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.780]   oh, this is referring to us.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.460]   It may be, but let's examine closely when he says that.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.380]   If we have been truly crucified with Christ,
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.780]   we believe that we will also live with him
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.440]   because we have this groaning, according to Romans 8,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.300]   that can't be satisfied in anything else but Christ.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.360]   See, if you're a genuine believer,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.080]   it says in Romans 8.22,
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.860]   "For we know that the whole creation
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.040]   "has been groaning together in pains of childbirth until now
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.680]   "ever since the fall."
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.500]   Everything that has been created, something went wrong.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.800]   It's been under the dominion,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.160]   this dark cloud of God's judgment.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.880]   And it's been groaning, waiting
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.640]   for redemption to take place.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.960]   But not only the creation, it says in verse 23,
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.000]   "But we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.180]   "groan inwardly as we wait eagerly
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.800]   "for the adoption of sons."
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.320]   The Holy Spirit has been implanted, given us,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.040]   and that Holy Spirit primarily is groaning inside of us,
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.640]   longing for the second coming of Christ.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.760]   Now, some of you guys may say,
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.320]   wait a second, I thought we were already adopted.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.360]   Why are we groaning to be awaited,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.080]   to wait for him, his coming?
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.040]   It's kind of like a child who has been adopted,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.000]   went through the papers,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.240]   in every way is a child of the new father, new family.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.280]   But they didn't come and pick him up yet.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.800]   So in every way, that child has the benefit
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.320]   of being a child of this new family,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.560]   but the parents haven't physically come and gotten her yet.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.960]   And that's how it's described,
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.480]   that all of us, every genuine believer,
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.920]   who has confessed their faith in Christ,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.720]   has become an adopted child of God.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.640]   But the Bible says when he comes,
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.800]   he will take that into full fruition.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.360]   We will be glorified as Christ is glorified.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.920]   And until then,
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.880]   until then, there is a groaning in our hearts
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.520]   that cannot be satisfied until he comes.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.080]   And it is that groaning that causes us to pursue him.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.320]   It is that groaning that causes us to worship him.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.080]   It is that groaning that changes our lives.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.200]   1 Peter 1, 3, it says,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.400]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.000]   "According to his great mercy,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.800]   "he has caused us to be born again,
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.560]   "to a living hope through the resurrection
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.760]   "of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.080]   So again, he's not saying you should do this,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.480]   he's saying this is who you are, right?
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.160]   This is what a genuine Christian looks like.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.840]   And this is the reason why a genuine confession of faith
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.760]   does not lead to licentiousness.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.520]   It is to inherit, we have a living hope,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.560]   to an inheritance that is imperishable,
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.040]   undefiled, unfading, kept in heaven for you,
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.800]   who by God's power are being guarded through faith
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.040]   for salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.600]   So a believer who has been crucified with Christ,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.760]   we believe that we also will be resurrected with him.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.040]   And that everything that you and I have hoped for
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.680]   before we met Christ is rubbish.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.080]   In light of what we are waiting for.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.880]   In light of the groaning that God has placed in our hearts,
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.520]   everything else that gets in the way is rubbish.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.880]   Everything now is compared,
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.200]   well, if I do this, how does it affect that?
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.800]   And that's what Paul means here.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.240]   Those who have genuinely been forgiven of their sins
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.640]   and repented and is united with Christ in his death
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.400]   will now be united with Christ in his new life.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.960]   See, he says not only will be united with him in life,
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.600]   he says it's in Christ we will be united.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.400]   1 John 5, 11 to 12, it says,
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.840]   this is the testimony that God has given us eternal life.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.800]   And this life is in his son, whoever has son has life,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.440]   and whoever does not have the son does not have life.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.120]   You know, back in college, I was taught how to evangelize
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.040]   and at the end, you know,
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.360]   how do you give assurance of salvation?
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.680]   This is one of the things that they taught us.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.240]   We'd come to this passage and we would say,
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.040]   you know, this is Jesus and this is life.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   And the Bible says that the life is in Jesus.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.880]   So when I give you Jesus,
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.760]   and then they would take the Bible,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.680]   say, what did you get?
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.560]   They'll say the Bible, no, pay attention.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.320]   This is Jesus, right?
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.080]   And this is life.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.440]   When I give you this, what did you get?
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.280]   Jesus.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.480]   What did you get with Jesus?
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.120]   Life.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:46.960]   Good.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.040]   See, that's what he means in 1 John 5, 11 and 12.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.480]   He said, this life is in Christ.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.840]   Jesus said, I am the way and I am the truth
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.960]   and I am the life.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.520]   So a life of a Christian is a pursuit of this life.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.840]   And this pursuit of this life is a pursuit of Christ.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.160]   And that's exactly what Jesus meant to his disciples.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.640]   You know, in the book of John,
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.240]   there's seven I am statements.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.920]   The last I am statement that he gives to his disciples
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   as he is leaving to go to the cross,
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.360]   he says, I am the true vine.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.720]   Turn your Bibles with me to John chapter 15.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.680]   I'm not gonna read all of it,
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.000]   but a portion of John chapter 15, one through 11.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.200]   A lot of times we read that passage as an encouragement
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.960]   to do something to bear fruit.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.080]   And I'm not saying that it isn't,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.720]   because every indicative, every theological truth
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.400]   leads us to the practice of that truth.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.080]   But typically when we look at this passage,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.040]   we look at this passage as like, you know, Christians,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.560]   you know, you need to do a better job.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.720]   If you wanna bear fruit, you need to remain in Christ.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.640]   But I want you to look at this passage in the context
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.200]   that Jesus isn't necessarily describing
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.320]   a mature and an immature Christian.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.880]   He's describing a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.000]   In John chapter 15, one is that I am the true vine
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.320]   and my father is the vine dresser.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.880]   Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit,
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.000]   he takes away.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.560]   What does he mean by take away?
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.400]   I'm not gonna answer, just keep that in mind.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.840]   What does he mean by take away?
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.600]   He takes away and every branch that does bear fruit,
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.240]   he prunes that it may bear more fruit.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.360]   Already you are unclean because of the word,
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.840]   you are clean because of the word
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.680]   that I have spoken to you.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.160]   Obeyed in me and I in you,
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.200]   as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.280]   unless it abides in the vine,
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.760]   neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.240]   But jump with me to verse six.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.920]   If anyone does not abide in me,
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.240]   he is thrown away like a branch and withers.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   Is that a Christian?
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.640]   Is that a Christian?
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.120]   Is that a lesser Christian who's not bearing fruit?
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.920]   He gets thrown away and gets burned?
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.160]   See, what he's describing is a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.120]   He's not describing a super Christian
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.360]   and a lesser of a Christian.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.880]   He's describing a Christian who is abiding in Christ
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.200]   who is bearing fruit.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.280]   And he's telling his disciples,
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.480]   up to this point, you've been abiding in me,
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.880]   you followed me.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.760]   They're afraid because Jesus has said,
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.800]   where I'm going, you cannot come.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.120]   Jesus said, no, I'm gonna go
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.360]   and the Holy Spirit's gonna come
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.080]   and he's going to further.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.040]   He's gonna remind you of everything that I have said.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.880]   And now he's going to empower you
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.680]   to do what I'm commanding you to do.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.200]   But in that context, he says,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.840]   you need to continue to remain in me.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.680]   As you've been following me up to this point,
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.080]   as you've been depending on me up to this point,
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.880]   you need to continue this.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.760]   And so he's describing a Christian versus a non-Christian.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.200]   So in other words, what he is saying is,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.520]   a Christian life, his justification, sanctification,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.680]   glorification is a pursuit of Christ.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.520]   It is a continual, ongoing pursuit of Christ.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.000]   And the reason why we pursue him
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.080]   is because that's where we find life.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.880]   That is the difference between a Christian
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.960]   and a non-Christian.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.720]   A Christian is not somebody who comes to church,
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.960]   owns a Bible, attends Bible study and evangelizes.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   That is not a definition of a Christian.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.560]   A Christian is someone who is born again into a new life.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.960]   Now, does a genuine Christian evangelize?
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.800]   Absolutely.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.160]   Does a genuine Christian read the Bible
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.000]   and do all that stuff?
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.840]   Absolutely.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.840]   Those are the fruits that come from a genuine salvation.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   But the difference, the fundamental distinction
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.480]   between a Christian and non-Christian
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.040]   is, is he remaining in Christ?
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.080]   Is there a groaning for him that causes me,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.120]   the hope that I have in him that causes me
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.080]   to make certain decisions and do this?
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.440]   See, not only do we have this hope in him,
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.600]   in verse nine and 10, it says,
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.800]   "We know that Christ being raised from the dead
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.920]   "will never die again.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.600]   "Death no longer has dominion over him.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.280]   "For death he died, he died to send ones for all."
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.480]   This is what happened.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.480]   See, again, he's describing a Christian.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.600]   Again, and let me make this clear.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.560]   He's not describing everybody that goes to church.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.600]   He's not describing everybody who confesses.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.360]   He's describing every genuinely born again Christian.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.640]   And this is why it doesn't lead to licentiousness.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.760]   Because our hope is in Christ.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.000]   And I want him more than anything else.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.040]   That's why we come to church.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:37.920]   That's why we give.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.960]   That's why we sacrifice.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   Because those are avenues in which we remain in Christ.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.200]   But here's the other thing.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.560]   Up to this point, he's been talking about indicative.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.200]   He's describing a Christian.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.240]   So starting from verse 11, he's gonna switch gears
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.960]   and start talking about the imperatives.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.640]   Therefore, this is what you need to do.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.480]   Verse 11.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.920]   So, again, so is just another word for therefore,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.120]   you also must consider yourself dead to sin
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.400]   and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.920]   That word consider is the first imperative
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.240]   in six and a half chapters of the gospel.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.760]   Up to this point, Paul never said,
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.040]   you need to do this and you need to do that.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.280]   He's just been laying out what the gospel is
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.800]   and who a genuine Christian is.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.840]   And so now he says, if that's who you are,
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.600]   consider yourself dead to sin.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.160]   Now, when we read a passage like this,
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.960]   one of the first things that we may think is,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.840]   is he talking about wishful thinking?
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.160]   Is he just talking about positive thinking,
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   like go to yoga and go up to the woods
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.920]   and say, dead to sin, dead to sin,
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.800]   dead to sin, dead to sin, dead to sin.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.160]   Enlightenment, right?
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.880]   Is he just talking about positive thinking,
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.320]   deny the reality?
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.200]   Those of you who are dead to sin,
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.360]   that if you have these temptations
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.880]   and you're struggling and wrestling,
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.280]   that you're not a Christian,
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.320]   we're all guilty, right?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.200]   Is that what Paul's talking?
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.120]   Is he talking about just wishful thinking,
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.800]   but not dealing with reality?
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.200]   Absolutely not.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.880]   So we need to know first and foremost,
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.880]   what does he mean then to consider?
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.600]   There's two meanings.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.760]   The first again, is about what we think, right?
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.880]   To recognize that we have been freed
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.840]   from the bondage of sin.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.640]   Even though there are times that you may not feel
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.920]   like you've been freed.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.280]   I'm pretty sure there are people in this room
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.800]   that may not feel that way, right?
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.560]   You genuinely believe, genuinely repent it,
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.040]   genuinely desire holiness,
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.600]   but there are times when we feel like we're bound,
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.560]   because we may not be successful for whatever the reason.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.400]   He is saying that every genuine Christian
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.160]   no longer has the reign of sin in your life.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.800]   And let me describe what that means, okay?
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.680]   It's kind of like an example I can give you
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.080]   is a man who was convicted of murder,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.920]   double life sentence, there is no possibility of parole.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.000]   Somebody has compassion, say, you know, I'm gonna pay,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.800]   I'm gonna take his place, and that's the gospel message.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.720]   And then now the door has been opened.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.280]   Door has been opened, he's no longer bound.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.200]   He can live in the jail.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.760]   He can eat their cafeteria food,
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.440]   he can use the library, he can use the infirmary,
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.800]   but he's no longer bound by that jail.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.840]   He's no longer bound because his guilt has been taken away.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.120]   So anytime he wants to leave, he can leave.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.480]   And so the first description when he says,
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.520]   consider yourself debt to sin,
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.960]   is describing and making sure that every Christian
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.000]   understands that you no longer are bound
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.480]   because of your sins.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.120]   Let me give you another way for us to understand this.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:57.440]   Author of Hebrews says that the door
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.320]   to our heavenly Father has been opened.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.160]   There is no longer any barrier.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   And so he invites us to come to this throne of grace
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.680]   with confidence because Jesus, our mediator,
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.800]   is constantly mediating on our behalf as our high priest.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.320]   So there no longer is any barrier because of this.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.600]   So the difference between a non-Christian who sins
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.360]   and a Christian who sins is a non-Christian is bound.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.240]   He has no answer for his sins.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.000]   So every careless word that comes out of his mouth
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.080]   is under the condemnation of God.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.880]   Every lustful thought, every slander,
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.120]   every mistake that he's made that is considered sin,
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.280]   there's a weight of sin and judgment
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.040]   that is having dominion over his life
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.680]   'cause there's no answer for sin.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.240]   But for a Christian, we repent.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.920]   And again, when we say we repent,
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.280]   we're not just saying like we say these magical words.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.400]   We genuinely come to the Lord and we repent.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.280]   And when we repent, we're forgiven.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.980]   And that weight of that sin is lifted
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.400]   every time we repent.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.560]   And there is no barrier between us and God.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.640]   So therefore, we have access to this God.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.560]   And that's why Paul is able to say,
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.560]   I can do all things through him who gives me strength.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.720]   He's not saying I can do it.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.320]   He said now, because the door has been opened
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.520]   and I'm no longer bound by the guilt of my sins,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.800]   I have access to the heavenly Father that I can pray.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.920]   And so I have strength.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.260]   That's why Paul says I'm laboring and sacrificing
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.640]   with the strength that works so powerfully within me.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.020]   In other words, not by his own strength,
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.680]   but by the strength that God gives him
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.540]   because of what Christ has done.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.860]   So the first and foremost, he's saying,
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.660]   if you don't recognize that this door has been opened,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.980]   you can live the rest of your life saying,
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.440]   woe is me, woe is me.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.760]   But that is not you.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.940]   If you are genuinely a child of God
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.260]   and genuinely repented
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.320]   and genuinely was crucified
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.460]   and was resurrected along with Christ,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:08.160]   there's nothing between you and God.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.920]   And that's why the second part of this is possible.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.440]   The second part of the word consider is to actively pursue,
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.800]   like it says in Ephesians 4.1.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.480]   After three chapters of explaining what Jesus did for us,
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.600]   basically it's the gospel message.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.680]   In chapter 4.1, it says,
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.580]   therefore I, prisoner of the Lord,
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.580]   urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.480]   to which you have been called.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.700]   There's nothing more frustrating
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.480]   than if somebody above you tells you to do something
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   that you just are not capable of doing.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.740]   If running a marathon was the qualification of a pastor,
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.820]   I would not be here.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.100]   So you guys who love playing basketball,
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.580]   it's like, you know what, you have to be the center.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.240]   We're putting a new team together and you're five feet three
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   and they say, you have to be the center.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.420]   You may love basketball,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.420]   but you're not gonna love that basketball.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.660]   And every time you can't get a rebound
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.700]   and somebody towers over you,
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.060]   I mean, there's nothing more frustrating
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.140]   than to be commanded to do something
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.940]   that you are not capable of doing.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.500]   A lot of people look at their Christian life and says,
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.220]   well, God is telling me to do things that I cannot do.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:26.220]   The gospel tells us, no, that is not the case.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.020]   He says, there is no barrier between us and God.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.660]   And what gives us the strength?
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.540]   Repentance.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.940]   'Cause every time we genuinely confess our sins,
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.860]   there's no barrier between us and God.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.740]   So therefore, if you abide in him,
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.340]   in my words, abide in you, he says,
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.220]   ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.700]   The power is not within you.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.860]   And that's why he says, well, I'm ready to go.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.140]   I'm ready to preach the gospel.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.300]   In the book of Acts chapter one, he says, do not go.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.660]   The Holy Spirit's gonna come upon you.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.500]   And when he comes with power,
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.460]   then you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.700]   Judea, Samaria, to the remotest part of the world.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.380]   He didn't take this burden.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.580]   It's like, these guys just utterly failed.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.660]   They couldn't stand with Christ going to the cross,
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.540]   and then you're gonna give that burden to them
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.880]   to get the gospel to the remotest part of the world?
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.980]   Are you kidding me?
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.140]   Peter's gonna fail again and rebuke publicly
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.720]   in the book of Galatians.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.660]   2,000 years, we're still talking about him.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.740]   His utter failure.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.340]   You're gonna give that responsibility to him?
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.140]   Yes, because it wasn't Peter.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.100]   It was the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.940]   It wasn't Paul.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.300]   It was him.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.060]   And so the first and foremost, he says,
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.940]   recognize who you are.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.740]   And if you recognize who you are,
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.860]   the second part of this consider
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.380]   is now live up to the calling you have been given.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.140]   Live up to it.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:00.220]   Right now, as you guys know, the Olympics are going on.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.260]   And it's always interesting.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.420]   It's not because, I'm not interested in all these sports.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.940]   There's basketball, maybe swimming, if I know who they are.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:13.940]   Archery is a few things that I have interest in.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.440]   I know nothing about archery, but just for some reason,
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.160]   it's just interesting to me.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.340]   But every single one of these athletes
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.260]   have been preparing for years and years.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.780]   Some of them, since they were little children.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.340]   20 years.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.540]   That's all they've been doing.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.900]   So they're coming up on the stage,
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.980]   and I look at that and said, wow.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.700]   We celebrate their achievement,
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.180]   but at the same time, it's like, there's no way.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.620]   I could practice all my life,
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.420]   and I would never be able to do that.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.300]   But when I look at the Paralympics,
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.860]   I look at these Paralympics, and I'm thinking, wow.
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.020]   Look at what they're doing,
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.060]   even though the deficiencies they have physically,
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.060]   that it's much more of a challenge.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.180]   20 years ago, a lot of these things that are happening now
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.020]   could not have been done.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.740]   But because of the advance of technology,
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.280]   you have these prosthetics where people can actually run,
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.340]   like in full speed.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.660]   They can actually swim, they can put limbs on.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.500]   And recently, I've been reading articles
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.180]   where the prosthetics at the tip,
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.940]   they can actually sense things.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.880]   So they can distinguish when they pick up something,
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.740]   that if it's an apple or a rock.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.080]   That's incredible, what they're able to do now.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.260]   And so when I look at that, I say, wow.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.940]   These guys are, again, physically challenged,
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.940]   but look what they're doing with that.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.980]   Imagine if the new technology comes,
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.380]   and they're able to get these,
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.900]   this person who didn't have legs,
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.580]   and all of a sudden, because of technology,
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.380]   somebody gives them these legs,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.500]   and you find them three years later,
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.220]   and you say, what did you do with that?
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.100]   Well, I sat on the couch,
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.140]   I'm able to go to the bathroom by myself.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.780]   And that in itself is great.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.140]   But these guys are taking these legs,
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.020]   and they're maximizing what they can do with these.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.660]   Like, they're running, they're competing,
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.180]   they're swimming, they're hiking.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.740]   They're doing more than what average person does,
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.420]   you know, who are whole.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.820]   I mean, even eyes, I mean, more and more people,
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.340]   like I said, people who have gone blind.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.580]   You know, there's some studies where some of these guys
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.340]   who are not 100% blind are starting to gain sight again
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.500]   because of, again, technology.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.340]   Imagine if you found somebody who's blind,
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.180]   you know, all their life,
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.420]   and all of a sudden, they gain sight,
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.780]   and then you find them three years later,
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.700]   what did you do with those new eyes?
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.220]   I watched every single movie on Netflix.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.420]   High five.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.900]   That's what you did with your eyes?
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.940]   That's what you did with your legs?
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.460]   That's what you did with your arms?
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.140]   See, what Paul is saying,
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:50.260]   every Christian didn't just get new legs and new eyes.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.580]   We've been given a new heart.
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.860]   We've been given new brains.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.300]   We have been crucified, and our old self died,
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.300]   and we've been given new life.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.340]   And so now he says, "Live!"
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.500]   That's what he means by consider yourself dead to sin,
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.780]   and alive to Christ, to pursue this life.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.900]   See, the frustration comes
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.860]   when we passively receive this life,
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.700]   and say, "Oh, I couldn't see,
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.260]   "and then now I can see."
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.100]   Thank you.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:26.060]   If that's all Christian life is,
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.380]   what do you need eyes for?
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.540]   What do you need legs for?
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.740]   And we don't see the benefit of this new life
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.500]   because we passively, we're constantly passively
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.220]   hoping that we could live vicariously with somebody else.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.140]   So we hear about people who went out to missions,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.500]   and sacrifice, and making disciples.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.300]   We're looking at all of this, and living vicariously.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.180]   We say, "Well, praise God.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.300]   "High five."
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.100]   And then we kind of forward emails that we get.
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.060]   Look how encouraging this article is.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.260]   "I heard this testimony, it's great."
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.140]   But we don't have our own testimony.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.540]   All we're doing is forwarding information
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.100]   that we're seeing with other people.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.140]   And then when we don't have enough
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.980]   testimonies around us, we get frustrated.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.540]   What's wrong with these people?
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.060]   See, when he says consider, the first imperative is,
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.820]   if you know that you've been given new life,
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.980]   and you've been given new legs,
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.340]   and new eyes, and new heart,
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.580]   now use it.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.540]   Now live it.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.420]   I remember the very first time my eyes got open,
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.500]   and I believed that God was real.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.660]   The first thought that I had was,
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.100]   I want to tell other people.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.540]   Wouldn't you?
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.300]   If you were blind all your life,
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.900]   and all your friends were blind,
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.100]   and somebody gave you new life,
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.540]   and this new life is something that they can have too,
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.460]   would you get this new life, and just,
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.220]   fantastic, and then go on a trip?
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:11.300]   I think we would all have the same thought.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.340]   I know a bunch of people who can't see.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.700]   I want them to have it.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.460]   And we pursue Christ.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.940]   We pursue fellowship.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.300]   We pursue his word.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.460]   Pursue, and let me,
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.220]   qualify that.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.060]   Not just passively receive.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:36.020]   And that's why people who are not actively pursuing Christ
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.820]   are the greatest critics.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.740]   You're like the people who are watching the Olympics,
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.220]   and you're watching, and then, you know,
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.620]   they do this fantastic vault,
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.100]   and then their leg moves just a second like that.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.940]   (scoffs)
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.220]   They don't deserve a knight.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.540]   That's a 7.5.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.300]   You know?
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.660]   Michael fell, you know, like,
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.540]   swimming, you know,
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.820]   swimming his heart out.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.900]   And he missed his first place by a millisecond.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.700]   (groans)
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.580]   28 gold medals.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.060]   He couldn't get 29.
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.700]   The people who are bystanders
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.900]   are the biggest critics.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.780]   We're celebrating other people's life
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.860]   and critiquing how they're living.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.780]   But if you're a genuine believer in Christ,
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.660]   you've been given a gift of new life.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.460]   And that's why he's not saying pursue it
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.460]   to make you feel guilty.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.820]   He's telling you, pursue it.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.300]   You have new legs.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.140]   Run!
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.900]   I've given you a new mouth.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.980]   Speak!
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.620]   I've given you a new heart.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.460]   Feel!
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:50.860]   I've given you new strength.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.700]   Now live.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.020]   That's why when Jesus says,
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.900]   "I've come to give life,
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.020]   "I've come to give abundantly."
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.380]   Not just enough so you can come to church.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.060]   Not just enough so you can be okay at Bible study.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.020]   But so you can live.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:13.940]   See, for a Christian, life is found in Christ,
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.300]   in Christ alone.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.140]   Alone!
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.140]   That's why we come to church.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.460]   That's why we sacrifice.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.380]   That's why we are united with Christ in his death,
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.420]   so that we may be united with Christ
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.340]   in his new, resurrected life.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.380]   Amen?
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.740]   That's why Paul is saying it does not.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.140]   Genuine repentance, genuine acceptance,
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.420]   genuine fellowship with Christ
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.580]   does not lead to the sentience system,
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.700]   but a new life in Christ.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.700]   Would you take a minute to pray with me?
