[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.920]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:38.280]   All right.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.640]   I'm going to just proceed with the teaching time,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.160]   and then the rest of the time we're going to break you up.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.960]   So whenever I see at the end of an epistle,
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.640]   the gut feeling might be to just kind of skim over it
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.080]   because all the theology is done.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.520]   Try not to do that, because each of these figures,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.040]   whether they're obscure or not, they're there for a reason.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.840]   So with these four individuals, I just
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.360]   kind of make a little chart.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.680]   I look at Artemis and Tychicus.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.600]   Clearly, they're not with Paul yet,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.320]   or they're not with Titus yet.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.240]   So my guess is, are they going to pick up the baton?
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.000]   When Titus leaves, are they picking up the baton?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.120]   Perhaps.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.960]   Now, Artemis, not to be confused with the Greek goddess Artemis,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.400]   is an unknown figure.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.760]   And that's fine.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.600]   And one thing I like about people
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.960]   who are named in the Bible but you know nothing about,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.080]   they're pretty cool people.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.400]   So my son, his name is Matthias.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.760]   And anybody know who Matthias is in the Bible?
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.400]   His name means gift.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.620]   But Matthias is the replacement of Judas Iscariot.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.960]   After Judas dies in Acts chapter 1, they cast lots,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.640]   and then Matthias becomes an apostle.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.360]   He gets elevated to the apostle ship.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.560]   That's all we know.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.080]   And my dad hated that name.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.760]   He's like, he just filled a number and disappeared.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.360]   Why are you naming him that?
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.000]   Dad, you named me Peter Pan.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.200]   You named me after Peter Pan.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.920]   So Matthias-- but when I was praying for my son
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.800]   while he was cellular, I was asking every day,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.680]   without fail, I said, Lord, I want
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.760]   him to be like a Matthias where none of us
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.600]   might know what kind of fruit he bears in his life.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.000]   His deeds might not be public.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.480]   His service to God might not be the most visible or memorable.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.000]   But I want him to be a faithful man.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.680]   I want him to be a fruitful man.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.480]   So that's my prayer for him.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.720]   And so Artemis, we don't know anything about.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.060]   But clearly, he's a man of God who
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.800]   may take over an eldership training program.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.680]   So Tychicus, you see him in other epistles.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.080]   And in Ephesians and in Colossians,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.000]   he's the one who carried the letters to the churches.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.680]   Now, are Zenos the lawyer and Apollos with Titus,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.660]   presumably?
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.320]   And perhaps they're the ones who brought the letter to Titus.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.920]   So Zenos the lawyer, we don't know who he is.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.080]   Praise God.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.720]   He has fruit that God knows about.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.880]   And then Apollos is a very well-known figure.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.560]   He's mentioned 10 times, Jewish preacher from Alexandria.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.120]   So I would do this.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.740]   And then there's a lot of resources
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.920]   available when you have obscure people in the Bible.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.480]   You can look up a dictionary and stuff
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.040]   and find all kinds of things.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.800]   Raise your hands if you did that.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   Great.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.720]   Now, Nicopolis-- so Titus is supposed
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.160]   to go to Paul in Nicopolis.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.720]   He's in Crete in this blue.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.320]   He's supposed to go to Nicopolis in the red.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.640]   It's 300 miles-ish, mostly via water.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.600]   And then I look up.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.000]   OK, it's a port city in modern-day Greece.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.080]   It's in a little bit of an inlet.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.960]   And then I actually Google searched Nicopolis, Greece,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.300]   winter temperature or something.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.600]   And this is what Google said.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.160]   It's low 60s and high 40s for cool.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.300]   But you just know that winter, they
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.680]   didn't have heaters back then.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.240]   So Paul wants-- he's an old man.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.840]   He wants to be where it's a little warmer.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.320]   I look at that.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.120]   And then I'm good.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.640]   Now, if you guys look at all the translations,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.240]   I don't know if you might have noticed.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.440]   This "make every effort diligently," the verses 12
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   and 13, they were translated very differently.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.840]   But the Greek word is the same, spidazo.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.800]   And it's a very difficult word to translate.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.560]   So NASB translates like "diligently, diligently."
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.720]   The other translations even mix it.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.280]   But spidazo is a very strong word
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.360]   of almost like an eager obsession and a passion.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.760]   So when I understand the meaning of this word,
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.840]   when I send Artemis or Tychicus to you,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.680]   do be zealous to come to me at Nicopolis.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.000]   And also be zealous in your help of Xenos, Elor, and Apollos.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Make it like a non-negotiable.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.840]   So I'm going to give you another verse that
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.320]   uses the same spidazo.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.520]   "But on the contrary, seeing that I have been entrusted
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.120]   with the gospel to the uncircumcised,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.400]   just as Peter had been to the circumcised,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.200]   for he who effectually worked for Peter
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.560]   in his apostleship to the circumcised
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.960]   effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles."
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.160]   That's God.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.360]   "And recognizing the grace that had been given to me,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.560]   James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.400]   gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.120]   so that we might go to the Gentiles
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.040]   and they to the circumcised, the Jews."
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.200]   So Peter, James, and John, right before Paul
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.720]   becomes a missionary to the Gentiles,
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.840]   because the first 12 years of his life,
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.080]   or the first 12 years of Paul's Christianity,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.200]   he was a missionary to the Jews.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.400]   Paul was not a missionary to the Gentiles yet.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.760]   But in about year 1213, he gets commissioned to the Gentiles.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.360]   So Peter, James, and John say, hey, you have the call of God
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.720]   to take the gospel to the uncircumcised Gentiles.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.800]   But Paul, please remember the poor.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.720]   They only asked us to remember the poor.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.920]   And the very thing that I, Paul, was spudazzo to do,
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.560]   it's a very strong word,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.000]   the early church cared about the poor.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.120]   They were very passionate about the poor.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.720]   Paul had been, for the first decade,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.200]   been zealous for the poor.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.320]   Are taking care of the poor important in the scriptures?
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.720]   Absolutely.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.880]   Okay?
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.560]   I'm just going to leave that there.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.960]   And we need to wrestle with that.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.520]   What does that mean?
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.440]   Okay?
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   Now, the application that I'm breaking you up,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.440]   and you're going to discuss, are these four.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.520]   All right?
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.360]   What were the challenges, difficulties, one and the same,
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.400]   and benefits of studying Titus inductively?
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.720]   For some of you guys,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.320]   this is the first time you've ever studied it inductively.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.160]   And some people hate it in the beginning.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.600]   They're like, just teach me.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.000]   Just talk to me about it.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.600]   Why are you making me do all the work?
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.920]   Okay?
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.560]   I said, the goal of our Bible studies
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.320]   is not for you to come to learn.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.080]   The primary goal of our Bible studies
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.480]   is for you to come to share
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.960]   what you've put into practice and learned at home.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.640]   You guys know that, right?
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.480]   Okay?
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   So, what are the challenges?
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.320]   Okay?
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.120]   Were you guys annoyed with it?
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.200]   Was it a very difficult exercise
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.640]   that proved to be beneficial?
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.720]   So, share that.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.640]   And this is something that you're all going to share together.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.480]   Okay?
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.800]   Secondly, what was the most impactful aspect
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.920]   of your study of the book of Titus?
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.800]   Any particular passage that challenged you the most?
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.040]   Okay, was there something in there
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.720]   that really challenged you?
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.600]   Three, what tangible applications are you moved to make
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.400]   from what you've been challenged by?
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.080]   So, don't just leave it at,
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.320]   oh, I really thought it was cool
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.760]   when he said, be subject to rulers and authorities.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.640]   Why?
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.160]   And how are you going to apply that?
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.000]   Okay?
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.120]   And the fourth question is,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.800]   as you prepare to study 1 Peter,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   which begins January 19th,
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.600]   which is five weeks from now,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.040]   and by the way, please sign up
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.400]   so that we can start putting people in groups.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.520]   Okay?
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.040]   What adjustments will you make to glean more from it?
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.600]   Remember, Titus, we did a 12-week study of 46 verses,
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.480]   which is an average of about 3.8 verses a week.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.960]   1 Peter is going to be 17 weeks,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.240]   105 verses, which with an average of 6.2 verses a week.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.520]   So we're going to be going more verses every week,
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.840]   longer for 1 Peter.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.680]   Okay?
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.640]   So obviously, you're going to have to tinker a little bit
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.160]   in your small groups.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.760]   And if you spent an hour and a half
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.480]   preparing for three verses,
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   one week, you might have eight.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.320]   Okay?
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.800]   So you might not be able to spend
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.320]   three and a half hours in a prep.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.720]   How do you adjust it?
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.680]   Go a little less deep and go broad first,
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.200]   and then if you have more time, go deep again.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.040]   Okay?
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.360]   But 1 Peter, just as a forewarning, is longer.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.520]   And for you guys who are in the practice
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.160]   of memorizing books, start now.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.000]   Okay?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.160]   So 1 Peter is definitely a very theologically heavy
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.720]   and a dense book.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.540]   And so how are you going to prepare for that
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.960]   during the five weeks that you have off?
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.240]   Maybe do one whole chapter a week before we resume,
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.500]   just so that you get a running start into it.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.340]   Okay?
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.200]   New Year's resolutions are coming up,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.560]   so maybe you put that into practice.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.660]   So whatever it is, go ahead and share.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.120]   All right?
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.840]   So you're going to be spending the rest of your time
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.680]   praying together and sharing about these four questions.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.240]   And that's how we will end.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.080]   Okay?
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   Guess what?
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.920]   I went only 10 minutes.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.760]   Woo-hoo!
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.800]   Normally it's like 30, right?
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.880]   But let me pray for us and then break up into your groups.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   And today you'll have a lot more time post-discussion
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.600]   to kind of share and glean together.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.440]   Okay?
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.080]   So spend the bulk of your time going over these questions.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.200]   Heavenly Father, we're thankful that you gave us
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.760]   this semester of Titus.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.560]   I pray that you would cause us to not just forget
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.320]   as soon as we walk out of here the lessons that we learned,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.240]   but really to help, would you help us just to meditate
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.080]   deeply on the truths that we studied through
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.440]   this past few months, and help us to get a running headstart
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.600]   into First Peter, help us to grow to become students
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.460]   who love your word, who love to practice your word,
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.440]   and who love to lead others in the study
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.480]   and the practice of your word.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.780]   So we pray for just good, fruitful discussions
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.480]   for the remainder of this evening,
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.980]   and we ask all these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.660]   (people chattering)
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.660]   (people chattering)
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.660]   (people chattering)
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:47.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
