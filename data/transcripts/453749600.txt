[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Alright, so this is our first session for the inductive Bible study of 1 Thessalonians.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.800]   And so I want to just kind of go over some guidelines as to the purpose of this study
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.680]   and what for you to expect.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.260]   First of all, as I mentioned in the first video that you hopefully you saw, the purpose
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.940]   of the study is not for me to study it and then for you to come and listen to see what
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.800]   insights that I've gained through my study.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.680]   It's really to get you into the scripture.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.680]   Because there's so much you can learn from sermons and hearing other people tell you
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440]   what they've learned.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.880]   The Bible says in 2 Timothy 3, 17, "All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.800]   for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.240]   be adequately equipped for every good work."
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.760]   The part where it says scripture is inspired by God literally means God breathed.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.720]   So there's a huge difference between hearing from someone else who've encountered God through
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.540]   the word versus encountering God directly yourself.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.760]   And so the goal of this is to get you into the scripture, not just to be a listener,
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.880]   but to be students, to study and be able to come to it on your own.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.840]   It says in 1 Peter 2, 2-3, "Like newborn babies long for the pure milk of the word, so that
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.160]   by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord."
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.120]   So again, it says to long for the pure milk of the word, the pure word, not word that
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.440]   comes through other people's mouth, not an interpretation from someone else's, but pure
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.760]   milk of the word, that we may grow in respect to salvation.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:06.780]   So not just to be satisfied that we're saved, but that we may continue to grow and to mature.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.760]   And so that's what the purpose of the inductive Bible study is, to get you into the word itself.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:22.640]   So in the study that we're doing, what I asked you to do last time was to first become familiar
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.560]   with the actual letter before consulting any commentaries or historical background.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.280]   So we want to do as much as we can without going to any other sources, because if you
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.240]   go to the commentaries, it's no different than hearing sermons.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   Someone else did the study just telling you what they found.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.440]   We want to be familiar with it as much as we can.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.920]   So we want to read it, and I asked you to outline it and get the major themes, repeated
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   words.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.760]   Hopefully, you've done that already, but if you haven't, it's not too late.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.200]   Again, if you yourself are not familiar with the text itself, then you're always going
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.080]   to feel like you're just kind of hearing other people's response.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.040]   So that's the first thing that we wanted you to do.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.640]   Then part of the homework was to answer as much of the who, what, why, when, where, how
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.320]   questions from the letter itself.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320]   Who wrote it?
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.280]   Why did they write it?
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.560]   Who did they write it to?
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.600]   When was it written?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.040]   Where was it written?
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.480]   In what manner was it written?
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.560]   What genre is it in?
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.800]   So we want to be able to answer those questions ourselves as much as we can, again, before
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.560]   anybody else tells you what they are, so that you can look for it yourself.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.280]   And then I asked you to outline the letter to get the logical flow of thought in the
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.960]   entire letter, not just the text that we're looking at.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.600]   But if Paul is saying something to the Thessalonians, how does that fit into the larger letter and
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.480]   what he's trying to get at?
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.100]   So again, I wanted you to do that before the study happens.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.440]   So hopefully, either you've had an opportunity or you're going to have an opportunity to
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.880]   share all of those things that you were able to get to before doing this study.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.800]   I want to give you some large outlines of the letter.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.200]   And again, hopefully you've done this yourself, but just to kind of give you some guidance
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.980]   on this.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.160]   The letter, again, this is not the only one.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.880]   These are certain ways that you can look at the letter.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.800]   The letter is divided into two major sections.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.440]   We have the first section, which is the narrative.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.720]   Paul describes a lot about how he came to Thessalonica, what he did, how he worked night
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.480]   and day, and how he loved them, how he served them.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.640]   And so that's the first part.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.280]   It kind of gives us a background in the relationship that Paul had with them and how the gospel
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.880]   had its effect on them.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.120]   And then the second part is the exhortation, chapter four and five, where he goes into
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.720]   abstain from sexual immorality, that this is God's will to hope for the second coming
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.960]   of Christ.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.320]   And so the exhortation happens in the second part.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.120]   It's not divided by indicative and imperative, but the indicative is kind of given in the
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.120]   context of a narrative instead of a straight teaching.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.360]   So that's what's going on.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.200]   You can see the outline in this way.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:30.920]   For another way to see it is a major breakdown of the letter in three parts.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.240]   First is the work of faith.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.640]   And again, he describes how the gospel came to the Thessalonians and their response and
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.920]   genuine faith of how they received it.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.040]   And then the second part is the labor of love, where Paul talks about his relationship with
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.560]   them and how he labored for them.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.480]   He went above and beyond just teaching the gospel.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.060]   And then the third part, chapter four and five, is calling to steadfastness of hope.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.520]   And so there's talk about end times and how certain things must happen before Christ comes
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   back.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.240]   And so you can divide the letter in this way.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.440]   Work of faith, labor of love, and steadfastness of hope.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.520]   Again, these are just things that I've observed as I was reading through it.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.240]   And then this is the teaching outline that I'm going to be using through the letter.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.140]   So I may or may not have given this to you, but you have access to this.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.800]   So if you want to take a picture of this and you know what's coming up.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.360]   So next week, our study is going to be verses one through five, which is Paul's ministry
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.000]   and the love for the Thessalonians.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.640]   And so it describes a bit about who he is and what he's doing with the gospel ministry.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.760]   So this is just for your information.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.620]   And then your outline may not look exactly the way I have mine.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.880]   I'm just going to be following what I have.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.320]   But again, this is to kind of give you the natural flow of thought that Paul is using
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.760]   to write this letter.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.640]   So that again, when we jump into verses one and five, we'll have the context of what he
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.880]   is saying instead of just jumping into it blindly.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.660]   All right.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.000]   So I wanted to give you some background information about the city.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.440]   Thessalonica is right here, if you can see it.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   And this is Paul's second missionary journey.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.360]   So Paul had three missionary journeys, but second one.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.080]   And so if you remember, Paul, actually, by the time he gets over here in Asia, he wanted
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.540]   to come to this area, but the Holy Spirit prevented him.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.000]   And then he was in this, he ended up going over to Troas.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.880]   And then he has a vision from the Spirit of Jesus telling him to come to Macedonia.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.680]   And that's why he crosses over.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.220]   And then he ends up in Philippi and the persecution in this area is pretty intense.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.160]   And so he gets jailed, beaten, and then he's basically going from city to city as he's
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.700]   being chased out.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.280]   And so he ends up in Thessalonica.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.040]   And in Thessalonica, he's only there for three Sabbaths, meaning he's in the synagogues teaching
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   about Christ.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.200]   And it says that many people ended up coming to Christ as a result of his preaching the
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:34.960]   gospel, but persecution was so intense, he ended up having to leave abruptly.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.880]   And so from there is where he comes to Berea.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.640]   Okay, Berea, again, is mentioned in Acts chapter 7 and 11.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.720]   And then from there, he ends up going to Athens.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.320]   So that's how he ends up in Thessalonica.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.240]   So Thessalonica probably was not in his initial plan to get there because, again, he wanted
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.640]   to stay in the Asia Minor area.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.800]   But again, the Spirit of the Lord directed him toward that path.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.420]   And then Thessalonica, Philippi becomes one of the churches that he gets very attached
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:14.320]   to and bears quite a bit of fruit.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.400]   So that's kind of like the background behind it.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.040]   Thessalonica is actually a very large city in that area.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.360]   It was the capital of Macedonia.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.480]   Macedonia is this whole area.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.960]   And again, I'll just give you a little bit more information here.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.880]   The background information.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.080]   The letter that he writes to Thessalonica is one of the earliest of letters.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:41.120]   In fact, the only other letter that was written before this is the letter to the Galatians.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.680]   And Galatia is a church that's in Asia Minor, where he initially wanted to go.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.640]   So that's the earliest letter.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   And then the second earliest letter is Thessalonica.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.920]   Or the letter to Thessalonians.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.640]   Again as I mentioned, it's the capital of Macedonia.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.120]   It was not a small city.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.360]   They estimated somewhere around 200,000 people lived in that city, which at that time is
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.240]   considered a major, major city.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.520]   And then like most of the metropolitan cities, the city was known for its pagan rituals and
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.880]   sexual promiscuity, which was again very common at that time.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.560]   So when Paul came and began to preach about Christ and people began to convert, it was
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.760]   a direct offense to them.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.480]   That it wasn't just introducing Christ, that believing in Christ meant that everything
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.160]   that they were doing was also wrong.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.320]   And so as a result of that, they were called out.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.160]   Kind of very similar to the situation that we're in today.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.520]   If we just talked about the love of Christ, there would be no pushback.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.200]   It's the love of Christ that causes us to see the scriptures, to follow Christ.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.360]   And to follow Christ means to go directly against some of the things that this world
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.960]   values where we live in.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.500]   And sexuality is one of the biggest ones.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.400]   And this is not unique to us.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.540]   This was true from the very early on in the church.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.680]   And that's why they were so heavily persecuted.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.800]   And again, the persecution was directly linked to the power of the gospel of what it was
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.000]   doing to the society.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.160]   The purpose of the letter.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.360]   Why did he write this letter?
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:24.080]   Well, it says in 1 Thessalonians 2, "We brethren, having been taken away from you for a short
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.720]   while in person, not in spirit, were all the more eager with great desire to see your face,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.680]   for we wanted to come to you.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:38.200]   I Paul, you know, more, but as a result of Satan's work, they were hindered."
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.840]   So he was very concerned that he was bearing much fruit and because he wasn't able to follow
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.720]   up and he had to leave abruptly, he wanted to make sure that they were okay.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.480]   So he sends Timothy to go check up on them.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.600]   And then he brings a good report about how they are thriving and grown in their faith.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:00.160]   And in fact, not only are they thriving, they've become the model church in just a short period
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   of time.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.840]   And so Paul is writing this letter rejoicing over what he is seeing, but also to encourage
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:14.120]   them to persevere in the gospel ministry that he has left.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.120]   So that's the main purpose behind why he writes this letter.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   Some of the themes, again, this is included in the outline, but marks of genuine faith.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:32.080]   Chapter 1, verse 4 and 5, and again, through the rest of the letter, what is a genuine
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.960]   response to the hearing of the gospel?
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.440]   What does genuine repentance look like?
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:47.120]   Another theme is, a sub-theme of that is, write gospel, write messenger, and write response.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.400]   And so we see those major themes that are being fleshed out in these chapters.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.600]   Chapter 2 is mission 101 because it describes how Paul preached the letter, preached the
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.400]   gospel, how he handled himself while he was there.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.480]   What did he do about setting an example?
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.800]   So again, if you want to learn about how Paul did missions work, again, chapter 2 is a great
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.400]   letter to go to, great chapter.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.560]   Paul's shepherding heart, he didn't just preach the gospel and leave and say, you know, I
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.720]   done my job, but he genuinely loved them with the love of Christ.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.400]   And so we see that in chapter 3.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.520]   Chapter 4 is persevering in sanctification.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.640]   Now that you're a believer, what does that mean in application in your life?
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.800]   And so he gives exhortations and how they ought to live.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:44.520]   And then obviously the second coming of Christ in chapter 4 and chapter 5, and it says that
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.880]   some of them actually fell asleep.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.880]   And when they say fell asleep, obviously they're talking about some dying.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.600]   And in context, it looks like some were actually being killed.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.880]   So the persecution was very intense.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:01.000]   It wasn't just, you know, they were having a hard time eating somewhere, actually dying
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.080]   because of this persecution.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.200]   And so these are the major themes that that kind of outlined this letter.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.320]   All right.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.880]   So I want to get you started in verses one through five.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:21.100]   And just to kind of show you, you know, one of the things that I do that for me personally
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:26.480]   helps me to understand the thought flow of what's going on in the immediate text.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.400]   So we're looking at verses one through five, and I've already divided it for you because
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.800]   I haven't figured out how to move the text while I'm recording, but I've already moved
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   it.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.640]   So what I did was I divided the thought flow, meaning whenever there's a comma, there's
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:48.920]   a preposition or transitional phrases or certain things that are, you know, main themes or
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.360]   sub themes.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.240]   So I kind of usually this is what I do in every before I do every sermon or go into
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.560]   every text is to kind of get the thought flow by doing this on my computer.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.180]   So if you look at it, it's a Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, obviously, then there's a comma.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.280]   And this is part of the introduction to the Church of the Thessalonians.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.240]   Now the reason why this helps me is because I see line by line his thought process instead
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.320]   of just seeing it in one big, one big statement.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.480]   And you can kind of lose the main point of that when you're seeing four or five sentences
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.360]   all at once.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.680]   But by dividing the words and the phrases this way, immediately when I look at it, I
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.160]   can tell like, oh, Paul is talking to the Thessalonians and he's saying in God the Father
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.320]   and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.200]   And then his actual greeting is grace to you and peace.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.880]   So it's just verse one, but that helps me to see his thought flow, his main point.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.080]   And in that, OK, the second verse, we give thanks to God always for you, all of you.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.720]   Again, there's a comma making mention of you.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:04.520]   So whenever there's a comma or there's a there's a linking like a preposition, then I usually
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.920]   just put it in the next line.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.240]   And then if if it's a sub point, I will put it underneath it.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.000]   And then to make sure that when I look at it, I can say, oh, he's starting a new thought.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.360]   And then here's a supporting idea.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.240]   I'm praying for you and we're always thinking of you.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.960]   Thankful for you making mention of you in our prayers, constantly bearing in mind.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.720]   So in in our prayer, in our thoughts, work of faith, labor of love and steadfastness
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.840]   of hope.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.680]   So when I see that just written out like that, it's like that really kind of stands out because
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.480]   faith, love and hope is a common theme in the New Testament.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.440]   And you see that being repeated over and over again.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.080]   So being able to see that right on the on the letter helps me to understand what he's
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   getting at.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.840]   OK, so I'm I'm praying for you.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.720]   And whenever I think of you, I think of your faith.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.520]   I think of your love and I think of the steadfastness of hope in Jesus Christ again in the presence
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.800]   of our God and father.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.840]   So you know that this is also part of the introduction, because in God, the father and
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.480]   the Lord Jesus Christ, and he ends first three in the same way in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.480]   in the presence of God, the father.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.480]   Right.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:17.160]   So he's trying to make sure that that his, you know, his main thing that he is saying
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.600]   is that this is all in Christ.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   Right.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.640]   Is a response to Christ response to God's presence among them.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.360]   And then verse four, knowing brethren beloved by God, his choice of you.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   He says he knows that God chose them.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.680]   And then he gives the reasons behind that for our gospel did not come to you in word
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.160]   only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.260]   So he says, these are the things that I see in your response to the gospel, which gives
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:49.800]   me assurance that you are chosen by God because the word of God did not come to you just word
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.240]   only, but in demonstration of the power and with full conviction.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.440]   And then he talks, begins to talk about his own ministry, just as you know, that what
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.840]   kind of men we prove to be among you for your sake.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:06.360]   So here we have, um, the gospel that he preaches their response.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.760]   Uh, the, the messenger that brought the gospel.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:16.500]   And so again, when you look at this kind of, uh, thought flow, it is much easier to kind
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.520]   of hone in on the main points.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.520]   Right.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.200]   So if you look at versus one, uh, you know that that's the introduction two and three,
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.280]   the thought is connected.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.320]   Right.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.640]   And then you could say it's, it's all connected, but the, there's a much closer connection
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.920]   between verse two and three, and then again in verse four and five.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.200]   So it's easier for me to kind of hone in on and ask certain questions and do some digging.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.640]   So this is whenever I do inductive study or prepare for sermon, this is the very first
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.880]   thing that I do.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.720]   Um, because it'll kind of, it'll help me to organize my thoughts and see the text in major
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.000]   themes and then sub themes.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.480]   And then it kind of highlights, um, certain things that I may not get if it was just all
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.440]   jumbled in in one paragraph.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.640]   Okay.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:11.080]   So if you get a habit of doing this for every text, um, I can guarantee you it will help
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.720]   you a great deal to get more insights out of the text.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.680]   Okay.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.520]   Now asking questions is, um, a huge part of the inductive Bible study.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:29.640]   And there are three T's, three principles, um, with a T, three T's that I want you to
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.520]   remember in asking good questions.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.200]   One is a text dependent, meaning that this is not a question that you had outside.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.080]   I said, well, you know, what is the Trinity?
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.960]   What has nothing to do with the text?
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   It's in and of itself.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:49.560]   What you can ask is it mentions God, the father and the son, Jesus Christ.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.180]   How come the Holy Spirit is not mentioned in this, in this text?
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.320]   So you want to make sure that it is text dependent, meaning that the questions are coming from
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   digging from the text itself, not something that you had outside that you're bringing
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.840]   into the text.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.400]   Um, second T is the tension in the text.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.440]   Are there any things that he says here that, that kind of seems like a paradox or difficult
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:19.160]   to understand, or he says something and then he says something else that seems to contradict,
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   seems to contradict.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.800]   Are there any tensions in the text?
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.440]   So again, as I mentioned, you know, apostle Paul, you know, uh, mentions God, the father
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.200]   and the son, but, but how come the Holy Spirit is not mentioned?
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.420]   So again, that's a question that you can ask, right?
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.240]   Is there a tension in the text?
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:42.240]   Um, again, as, and as we go along, uh, hopefully you'll be able to see this being applied in
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.000]   the way that we're studying the, the, the text that we're at.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.200]   And then third T is the tie of thoughts together, right?
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.360]   Are there particular themes?
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.240]   So if you look at the text that we're looking at, the, the verses one through five, obviously
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.760]   you have the introduction and then Paul jumps into his gospel ministry.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.320]   And then the emphasis here is on the response to the gospel.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:12.000]   Paul says he has assurance of their salvation, that they were chosen by God because of what
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.120]   he sees, right?
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.080]   Their faith, love and hope that they have and how the gospel came in power.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:26.480]   Uh, and again, all of these things are evidence of assurance that, that he has so that when
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.200]   he prays for them, that he has confidence he's praying for Christians.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.520]   So again, so these are good questions that will lead to better observations and interpretation.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   Okay.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.840]   And then obviously the, the final part after you've done the observation interpretation
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.440]   is the application, right?
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.160]   In application, we ask what insights did I gain about God and the gospel?
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.120]   And that's the question that we should always be asking because before we seek, okay, what
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.720]   should I do?
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.640]   We have to ask, what did I learn?
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.140]   And as the scripture says, as Jesus himself says, all of it is about Christ.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.920]   So what did I learn about God?
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.600]   What did I learn about what he did in the gospel?
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.920]   That's the first thing that we need to be asked.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.920]   What did I learn?
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.960]   And then is there a promise to hold on to, right?
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.360]   Again, you're not going to find this in every text, but these are the general principles
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.700]   of how to make applications.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.600]   Is there a command to obey?
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.920]   So from these things that I've learned, are there things that I need to adjust, to change,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.480]   to repent of?
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   Okay.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.560]   And then is there an example to follow or even avoid?
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.440]   There's something apostle Paul did that I should be doing in evangelism.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.200]   Is the way that people responded, is there something that I need to be learning and applying?
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.440]   Obviously there are clear examples of that because Paul mentions about his ministry and
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.480]   the way that the Thessalonians responded.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.760]   And then finally, what practical application can I make that is practical and measurable?
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.800]   So the application part, you know, when we apply certain things, we want to make sure
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.080]   that it is measurable.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.280]   Again, I mentioned this before, but not just to say, I want to be a good Christian or I
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.680]   want to follow Christ.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.780]   And all of that obviously is assumed, but in what way are we to follow Christ based
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.520]   upon the teaching of this text?
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.400]   And then too, if you're going to make an application, make it very specific so that if somebody
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.960]   was to ask you the following week, did you do this?
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.720]   That you can say, yes, I did or didn't do it.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.040]   When are you going to do it?
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   How are you going to do it?
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.880]   So if you're going to pray, when are you going to pray?
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.880]   How long are you going to pray?
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.800]   What are you going to be praying for?
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.320]   Who are you praying with?
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.920]   And to make the application practical and measurable.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:42.640]   So the whole purpose of inductive Bible study is to lead us to this application, to learn
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:50.440]   about God, to hold on to promises, to obey the commandments, to follow examples, and
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:55.760]   then make measurable practical applications.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.880]   Then again, finally, this is the discussion question that I'm not going to read it because
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.440]   it's self-explanatory.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.320]   So you can use this as a guide as you end this.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.940]   So again, as you guys are doing the study for 1 Thessalonians 1-5, please follow these
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.720]   principles that I've given you so that you can come prepared.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.120]   So again, I want to tell you, if you signed up just because you want a fellowship and
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:28.400]   rub shoulders with other people, there's other avenues where you can do that.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   This is strictly for the purpose of studying the Bible.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.920]   Not to listen to the Bible, not to just kind of attend the Bible study, but to study the
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.020]   Bible.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:45.360]   So I really strongly encourage you to do your homework and set aside specific times of the
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.360]   day that you're going to pay attention to these texts.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:54.280]   And again, I guarantee you, when you start to gain insight from the Word of God yourself,
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.900]   the Word of God will really be open to you.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:02.200]   And you really will see that the breath of God has been invested in the Word of God.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.360]   And it's different from listening to sermons.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:10.800]   It's different from reading books that other people have written.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.060]   The Word of God is God's very words.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:19.500]   He deliberately chose certain words, certain phrases, certain cultural things to communicate
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.120]   certain things to us.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:28.320]   And so, inductive Bible study is the best way for us to get to that directly.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.400]   (laughs)
