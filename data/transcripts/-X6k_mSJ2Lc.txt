[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:40.200]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.080]   Let's make our way over to our chairs.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.320]   In about 30 seconds, we'll pray to begin our worship time.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.520]   And also, if you can hear me from the other side, too,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.120]   let's go ahead and get situated.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.600]   And we'll begin in just 30 seconds.

[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.960]   OK, everybody, please join me in a word of prayer.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.520]   Let us pray together.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.400]   Our God and Father, we are so grateful to you.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.100]   God, in every season, we owe you our gratitude.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.240]   And as we think about the undeserved grace
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.920]   you grant to us, God, we recognize
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.480]   that you bless us with your overflowing love.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.360]   Lord, I pray that that would continue just to fuel us,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.640]   to walk each day desiring to fellowship and commune
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.920]   with you.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.240]   And God, every time we're able to come together
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.940]   in the study of your word, in the fellowship of learning
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.960]   your truth and gaining conviction,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.300]   we are just reminded all the more of the privileges
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.440]   you grant to us in Christ.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.120]   We want to pray, God, that you continue
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.600]   to fill our hearts and our minds with awe and wonder of you
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.080]   so that, Lord, we can lift up to you our songs of praise
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.720]   with a united voice.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.240]   And we also pray, God, that you would do your sanctifying work,
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.760]   that each time we gather, God, it
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.080]   would produce the fruit of growth and maturity.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.320]   And what's more, that it would continue just to wash all
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.480]   the things that perhaps are distracting us,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.360]   the things that are preventing us from coming to you.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.880]   Would you grant that sanctification, Lord?
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.560]   We again want to thank you for this time
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.120]   and lift up these songs to you.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.480]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:21.440]   [MUSIC - "COME, THOU FOUNT OF EVERY BLESSING"]
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.560]   Come, thou fount of every blessing, tune my heart
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.920]   to sing thy praise.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.720]   Streams of mercy never ceasing, call
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.520]   for songs of loudest praise.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.960]   Teach me some melodious sonnet sung by flaming tongues
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   above.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.240]   Praise of mountains fixed upon it,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.440]   mounds of thy redeeming love.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:21.920]   Here I raise my Ebenezer, bitter by thy help I'm come.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:32.920]   And I hope by thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:43.400]   Jesus saw me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:52.880]   He to rescue me from danger interposed his precious blood.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:13.320]   O to grace how great a debtor, daily I'm constrained to be.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   Let thy goodness, like a fetter, buy my wandering heart to thee.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.800]   Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.280]   Prone to leave the God I love.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.760]   Here's my heart, I'll take and seal it,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.240]   seal it for thy courts above.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.720]   Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.200]   Prone to leave the God I love.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.160]   Here's my heart, I'll take and seal it,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.160]   seal it for thy courts above.

[00:06:48.440 --> 00:07:03.920]   I depend on you for the sun to rise, for my sleep at night.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.880]   I depend on you.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.360]   I depend on you.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.840]   You're the way, the truth, and the life.

[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.760]   I'm the branch and you are the vine.

[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.200]   I depend on you.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.680]   I depend on you.

[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:32.560]   When I pass through death, as I enter grace, I depend on you.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:42.000]   I depend on you for eternal life,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.080]   to be raised with Christ.

[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:13.720]   All right, amen.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.120]   Before we divide into our groups to discuss,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.400]   just a few important announcements for everybody.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.000]   Please make sure that you are looking ahead
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.520]   at the calendar for Easter week.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.400]   It's coming up in just a short amount of time.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.960]   Please note that from Monday through Friday,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.440]   there is something going on each evening.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.880]   From Monday through Wednesday, we
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.280]   are going to have 730 devotions.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.560]   And then-- sorry, that was Monday through Wednesday.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.480]   And then Thursday night will be Passover meal.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.880]   You do have to sign up to participate
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.720]   in that reenactment of the Passover meal.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.880]   And then Good Friday is going to be 730 PM,
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.240]   where we'll be participating in the communion as well.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   Early rise on Sunday will take place 6 AM
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.040]   in the outdoor courtyard.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.240]   So please also mark that on your calendar
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.800]   and just put a note there to dress warmly before you come.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.320]   On Easter, after the main services,
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.680]   we will be providing some fellowship lunch.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.280]   Even the first service, we're going
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.560]   to be giving box lunches to go.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.160]   Because there has to be a transition
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.660]   into the second service, we're going
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.640]   to request people take their meal and go home.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.960]   But for the second service, there
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.080]   will also be some seating for fellowship as well.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.480]   I'm just giving an early heads up
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.920]   because it's going to come up really soon in just
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.400]   a few short weeks.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.680]   OK.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.120]   The other thing I want to mention
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.160]   is just please make sure you mark
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.120]   your calendars for the members meeting and service
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.200]   fair that will happen April 23.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.520]   I just want to highlight that as making sure everybody
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.360]   saves a date for that.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.280]   For tonight, there are some questions
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.520]   that Pastor Peter Chung wanted to give you
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.640]   as the preliminary questions to go over
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.920]   within your discussion about your inductive observations
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.040]   and questions.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.240]   So here are just three.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.640]   Share your questions and observations.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.480]   But what is the thing that can be potentially
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.120]   lost in this passage?
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.520]   What is the reward?
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   Also, what would be the challenges, risks,
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.600]   benefits of the application or even misapplication?
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.200]   So please make sure you include those into your discussion.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.680]   You guys are at this time dismissed,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.960]   and then we'll be back at 8.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   Thanks, everyone.

[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.080]   Hi, Tammy.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.080]   Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.080]   Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   Is this on?
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   Can you hear me?
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.080]   No, OK.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.080]   You can hear me from this?
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.080]   OK.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.080]   [HUMMING]
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   Can-- oh, uh, uh.

[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.080]   Can you hear me?
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:31.580]   No?
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.080]   Yes, no?
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080]   Woo-jean.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.080]   Can you hear me?
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.080]   OK.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:38.580]   All right.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.080]   If you guys can focus your attention up
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.580]   to the screen real quick.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:48.580]   Let me-- let me pray for us, and then we'll
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:52.580]   do a quick time of, like, a little wrap-up
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.580]   of today's passage.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.080]   Father, thank you for just your inerrant word
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.580]   and for giving us the ability to study this just
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:08.580]   with other people and to glean from others' observations.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.080]   And we pray that as we look into this,
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.580]   that you would cause us to just grow in our delight of the word
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.080]   and help us to also grow in our understanding
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.580]   and discernment of what you are saying
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:25.580]   and what you're not saying through this passage.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.580]   And Lord, as those who have their senses
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:32.080]   trained to discern good and evil through practice of your word,
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   I pray that you would just give us a desire, really,
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.580]   to apply the things that we see, even when it doesn't seem
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.580]   always practical.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.080]   And so give us wisdom, especially
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.580]   as the application of today's passage
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:50.580]   does seem a little bit cold if applied incorrectly.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.580]   So would you bless our time of study together?
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:56.580]   And I pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:01.080]   So this is-- the first thing that I do with this passage,
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:06.080]   just so that I can kind of organize in sight just what
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.580]   I need to focus on and what I can track through in terms
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.080]   of my inductive questions, there are what
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.080]   I would deem three significant words--
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.580]   or two significant words.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.080]   One of them is "for," and that's from last week's passage.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.580]   I ask you, lady, that we love one another, et cetera, et
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.080]   cetera.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.580]   We walk according to his commandments.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.080]   Why?
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.580]   There's many false prophets and antichrists and deceivers.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.580]   So that's what we're going to be looking at.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.080]   So significant words.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.580]   And then one of the hinge words is "this teaching."
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.580]   Whether you bring someone into your house,
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.080]   give them a greeting, whatever that means,
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.580]   and whether you don't depends on this teaching
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.080]   and the abiding of this teaching.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.080]   So that's actually a very important thing,
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.080]   to discern what is the teaching.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.580]   Secondly, I just highlighted all the characteristics
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:07.580]   that 2 John gives about the deceivers and the antichrists.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.580]   And then the only three commands in all of this letter
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.580]   I just put in the light blue.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:16.080]   So that-- because usually if there's a command,
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.080]   and then it's coming from an apostle,
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.580]   there's some degree of expectation that I obey it.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.080]   It's not like a suggestion.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.080]   So there are three imperatives there.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.580]   And they are "watch," "do not receive," and "do not give."
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.580]   Okay?
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.580]   And then the yellow is more like what is expected of a believer.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:40.580]   Okay, so that's how I would just organize it for my eyes.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.080]   And just as a quick review,
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.580]   we're looking at two major chunks of 2 John.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.580]   You have the section of the internal--
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.080]   the Christian fellowship.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.580]   And then what we're looking at for the bulk of today
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.080]   is the doctrinal dangers
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.580]   that are hovering around the church.
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.580]   Okay?
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.580]   And possibly it could cause you to lose something.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.580]   All right, so what is that?
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:11.580]   And so I just cut, paste, and put stuff in here in the green.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580]   All right?
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.080]   So the doctrinal dangers--
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.080]   so there are many deceivers that have gone on into the world.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.580]   Many.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.580]   So this is a real threat.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:26.580]   At this time, one of the heresies is Jesus didn't come in the flesh.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.080]   He only appeared, right, to come in the flesh.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.580]   He wasn't a man.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.080]   That's why 1 John actually starts with,
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.580]   "That which we have seen from the beginning,
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.080]   "that which we have heard, that our hands have touched."
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.080]   Because there was a teaching going around
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.080]   saying that Jesus only appeared to be a man.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.080]   He actually wasn't.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.580]   So that's something that could be being addressed here.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.580]   And it's a spirit of the Antichrist here,
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.080]   the deceiver.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:57.080]   They go too far, or they run ahead, right?
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.080]   So that's what they do.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.580]   The literal word in the Greek is "progressive" almost.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.580]   It's like--it means "progressive."
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.580]   Okay?
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:10.080]   This progressive person.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.580]   And then they don't abide in the teaching,
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.580]   and they don't have God.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.580]   And they don't not just abide,
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.080]   they bring something completely foreign.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:20.580]   Okay?
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.580]   They don't bring this teaching.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:25.580]   And it's evil.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.580]   And you join him in this.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.580]   It's evil.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.080]   So that's--I look at that,
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.080]   and then my mind knows what to kind of focus on.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.080]   And in that context, I have three commands.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.080]   I need to watch myself.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.580]   And then whoever these guys are,
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.580]   I don't receive, I don't give a greeting.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.580]   Okay?
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.580]   So that's how I would start.
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.080]   And then in the process of this,
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.080]   I end up with some questions.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.080]   What is this thing that could be lost?
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.080]   Nod your heads if you guys had that question.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.080]   Right?
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.080]   What is this?
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.080]   What is it that was accomplished?
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.080]   Who is the "we"?
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.080]   Who accomplished this?
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:10.080]   Is it John and the lady and her kids?
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.080]   Or John and the church and the saints?
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.580]   Is it John and all the apostles?
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.080]   Is it John and us?
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.580]   Like, what is this "we"?
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.080]   Right?
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.080]   And then what's the reward?
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.580]   Is there, like, a reward system in heaven?
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.080]   And then obviously a lot of these questions
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.080]   you might have to jump out of 2 John
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.580]   to answer biblically,
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.080]   but those are some of the questions
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:34.080]   that would preliminarily just come up in my head.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.580]   And so this is how I would answer them preliminarily.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.580]   Okay?
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.580]   What is the thing that could be lost here?
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.080]   Is it perhaps the teaching that could be lost?
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.080]   Is it the abiding that could be lost?
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   Is it, like, God, salvation that could be lost?
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.580]   And my instinct tells me,
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.580]   "No, I don't think that's quite what it is."
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.080]   Right?
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.080]   What's the stuff that's accomplished?
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.580]   Is it, like, the establishment of the church?
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.580]   Is it, like, the fruit of the abiders?
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.580]   What is it that could be lost?
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.580]   Or what was it that was accomplished?
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.580]   Because they don't accomplish salvation.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:12.080]   Okay, so those are the thoughts that I have.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.080]   And then is salvation the reward?
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.080]   What is the reward?
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.580]   Is it, like, God the Father, God the Son?
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.580]   Because that's mentioned.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.080]   So what exactly is the reward?
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.580]   And that's how my mind would start tracking through
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.080]   what I need to look for in 2 John.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.580]   If I can't find it in 2 John,
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.080]   I'll go to 1 and 3 John.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.080]   If I can't find it there, I'll look at John,
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.080]   the gospel, Revelation, New Testament,
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.580]   and then I'll just start branching out
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.580]   to see if I can answer these questions.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.580]   Okay?
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.080]   One interesting thing is all of 2 John,
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.580]   all the "us" are in the plural.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:45.580]   And that's something--
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.580]   immediately my mind's like,
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.580]   if it's all the "us" are in the plural,
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.080]   okay, watch yourselves, that you, plural,
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.580]   you all do not lose what we have accomplished.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:59.080]   That doesn't make it feel like
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:02.080]   a whole group of you can lose your salvation.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.080]   Right?
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:08.080]   Or that you all may receive a full reward.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.580]   So that will affect my understanding
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.580]   that all the "us" are in the plural.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.080]   And even receiving someone into the house,
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.580]   giving someone a greeting.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   If it's a church-wide exhortation,
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:22.580]   it's a little different from if it's a personal one.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.080]   Okay?
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:28.580]   And, yeah, that's kind of where my brain is going.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.580]   One of the passages that comes to mind
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:35.580]   in terms of what can be lost, okay,
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.580]   or what can be earned,
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.080]   I'll go to John 8, 31 to 37.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.080]   So Jesus was saying to those Jews
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.580]   who had believed him,
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.080]   "If you continue in my word,
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.580]   then you are truly disciples of mine.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.580]   And you will know the truth,
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.580]   and the truth will make you free."
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.580]   They answered him,
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.580]   "We are Abraham's descendants
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:57.580]   and have never yet been enslaved to anyone.
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:00.580]   How is it that you say you will become free?"
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.080]   And Jesus answered to them,
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.080]   "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.580]   everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.580]   The slave does not remain in the house forever.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.580]   The son does remain forever."
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.080]   So if the son makes you free,
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:17.080]   you will be free indeed, permanent.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.580]   Okay?
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.580]   "I know that you are Abraham's descendants,
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.580]   yet you seek to kill me
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.080]   because my word has no place in you."
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.580]   So there are similar themes that are going on here.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:34.580]   Is it possible for someone to believe in Jesus
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.080]   and not abide in Christ?
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.580]   There are things and observations
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.580]   I can make from this passage.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:47.080]   You can believe in the words of Jesus like these Jews,
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.580]   but the fact that they don't continue
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.080]   is a telltale sign that they're not.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.080]   And what is more,
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.580]   the fact that they even want to kill him
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:57.080]   and expunge him out of their lives,
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.580]   it's pretty telling.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:00.080]   So there are similar themes
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.580]   that I will make observations of
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.080]   in the Gospel of John here.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.080]   John 10, 26-30,
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.080]   "But you do not believe
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.580]   because you are not of my sheep.
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:14.580]   My sheep hear my voice,
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.580]   and I know them, and they follow me.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.080]   And I give eternal life to them,
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.080]   and they will never perish,
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.080]   and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.080]   My Father who has given them to me
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.080]   is greater than all,
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.580]   and no one is able to snatch them
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.580]   out of the Father's hand.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.580]   I and the Father are one.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.080]   Can you lose your salvation?
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.080]   You cannot.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.080]   If Christ sets you free,
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.080]   if he saves you,
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.580]   can you reverse that and run away from it?
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.580]   No."
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.080]   So this is another passage
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.580]   that will form and shape my theology.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.580]   1 John 2-18,
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.580]   talking about apostates here,
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.580]   "Children, it is the last hour,
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:09.580]   and just as you heard
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.080]   that the Antichrist is coming,
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080]   that Antichrist is coming,
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   even now many Antichrists have appeared.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.580]   From this we know that it is the last hour.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.580]   They went out from us,
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.080]   but they were not really of us.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.080]   If they had been of us,
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.080]   they would have remained with us.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.580]   But they went out.
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:30.080]   So it will be shown
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.580]   that they all are not of us.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.580]   But you have an anointing from the Holy One,
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:39.080]   and you all know."
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.580]   So I will consult these passages
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.580]   to think through what is it
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.580]   that is being lost?
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.580]   What is the stuff that's being accomplished?
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:52.580]   Can human beings accomplish salvation?
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.080]   No.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   So then what is John talking about?
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.580]   And just through the context,
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:03.580]   I saw this, okay?
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:07.080]   I'm on the Charles Haddon Spurgeon Facebook fan page,
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.580]   so I get quotes every day, okay?
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.580]   But it reads, "A time will come
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:17.080]   when instead of shepherds feeding the sheep,
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   the church will have clowns entertaining the goats."
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:28.580]   So if Charles Haddon Spurgeon were to say to us,
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:31.580]   this is my last sermon,
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:40.580]   "Do not lose what we have accomplished,
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:44.580]   but that you may gain a full reward."
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:49.580]   If, let's say, Pastor Peter were to share with us,
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:53.580]   "Don't mess up what we have accomplished
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:57.580]   in the last 26 years by the grace of God.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:01.580]   Let's all pursue gaining a full reward."
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.580]   I feel like that's kind of akin
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:06.580]   to what we're looking at here, right?
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:10.580]   Protect the church from these false prophets.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:14.580]   We've worked hard to build God's church His way,
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:17.580]   according to His commandments,
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.580]   and the enemy is constantly assaulting the church.
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.580]   You need to watch yourself.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:26.580]   And if you see these little people coming in
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.580]   and trying to distract,
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.580]   and most of what they're going to bring to you
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:34.580]   is going to sound kind of okay,
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.580]   don't receive them.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.580]   Don't even give them grace and peace to you
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.580]   from our Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.580]   That's how I take it.
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.580]   Like, don't consider them a Christian.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.580]   Don't say, "Brother."
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.580]   Don't say, "My dear sister,"
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.580]   who is of a different faith.
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.580]   Eh.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:00.580]   So don't associate with their doctrine.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:02.580]   And obviously, it's going to take wisdom
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.580]   in terms of how you associate with the person,
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.580]   but the church needs to be protected
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:08.580]   from any and every assault.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.580]   Amen?
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.580]   So that's what I see.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.580]   I don't see this like,
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:15.580]   "But that verse says, 'Don't lose what we accomplished.'
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.580]   It means I could lose my salvation."
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.580]   No, it doesn't,
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.580]   if you actually look at the whole of the context.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.580]   And then I'm looking at,
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.580]   what does another apostle,
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:25.580]   what do other people have to say
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:26.580]   about this kind of stuff?
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.580]   Oh, so going back to this,
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:30.580]   is doctrine important?
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.580]   For sure.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:33.580]   Especially in today's day and age.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:34.580]   Is it important?
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.580]   Absolutely.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.580]   And that's why at our church,
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.580]   we try to guard the pulpit
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:40.580]   from any strange teaching.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.580]   Because we don't want to lose
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:44.580]   what was already accomplished
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.580]   by the grace of God.
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:47.580]   Okay?
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.580]   So here's what Paul has to say.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:52.580]   "But the Spirit explicitly says
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:53.580]   that in later times,
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.580]   some will fall away from the faith."
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.580]   Okay, they weren't really of the faith,
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   but some will fall away,
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.580]   paying attention to deceitful spirits
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.580]   and doctrines of demons.
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.580]   There are lots of doctrines of demons,
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:10.580]   I believe, that are floating around in Christendom
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.580]   in today's context.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.580]   And a lot of my college friends
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.580]   are promoting some of them.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.580]   You guys know.
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.580]   There's a lot of people who go to church
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:23.580]   and do strange things.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:27.580]   But you pay close attention to two things.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.580]   To yourself and to your teaching.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.580]   And obviously this is to Timothy,
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.580]   but it also applies to everyone
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.580]   who calls himself a servant of Christ.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.580]   Pay close attention.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:41.580]   Scrutinize yourself and your teaching.
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.580]   NIV actually calls it
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.580]   "Watch your life and doctrine closely."
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.580]   And persevere in these things,
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.580]   for as you do this,
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.580]   you will be assured of salvation
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.580]   both for yourself and those who hear you.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.580]   So the word "abide"
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:57.580]   kind of comes back into my mind.
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.580]   So the word "abide" in John's letters
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:00.580]   are very important.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.580]   In his gospels, very important.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.580]   In the book of Revelation,
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.580]   I don't recall it being used much,
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.580]   but the word "abide" is very important
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.580]   to John's theology.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.580]   And I'm going to just
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:15.580]   slowly wrap up with one more.
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.580]   So who do we receive?
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.580]   Who do we greet?
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.580]   That's an important question.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:25.580]   And then who do we shun?
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.580]   So John says,
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.580]   Jesus says,
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.580]   "Abide in me, and I in you,
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.580]   as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.580]   unless it abides in the vine,
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:41.580]   so neither can you unless you abide in me.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:44.580]   I am the vine, you are the branches.
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.580]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.580]   he bears much fruit,
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:53.580]   for apart from me you can do nothing.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.580]   If anyone, any pastor, any teacher,
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.580]   especially, does not abide in me,
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:04.580]   he is thrown away as a branch and dries up.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.580]   And they gather them and cast them into the fire
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.580]   and they are burned."
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.580]   The tree will be known by its fruit, right?
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.580]   It will be burned.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.580]   "If you abide in me, and my words abide in you,
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.580]   ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.580]   My Father is glorified by this,
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.580]   that you bear much fruit,
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:25.580]   and so prove to be my disciples."
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.580]   So there is an element of like perseverance.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   Perseverance is one of the hallmarks
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.580]   of all true believers.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.580]   Right?
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:39.580]   A genuine believer will persevere to the very end.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.580]   A lot of times, let's say pleasures of life,
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.580]   worries of this world, persecution,
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.580]   you guys know the parallel of the soils.
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.580]   They all fall out, they don't bear any fruit.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:55.580]   But the genuine fruit-bearing soil
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.580]   actually is multiple, 30, 60, 100 fold.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:05.580]   And one last little passage that I wanted to...
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:08.580]   "Sheep costumes worn by talented wolves,"
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.580]   is how I titled this.
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.580]   Can you guys spot the wolf?
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.580]   I don't know, I mean,
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.580]   that's probably just photoshopped or something,
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:21.580]   but I thought it was pretty clever.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:24.580]   Usually people occupy the pulpit
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:26.580]   not always because they're faithful men,
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.580]   it's because they're talented and gifted.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.580]   And they have nice resumes.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:36.580]   No church should ever hire or ordain
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:41.580]   or put someone up just because they can tell a tale,
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.580]   they can manipulate some emotions.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:46.580]   It has to be a man who not only teaches
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.580]   according to the word of God, but also lives it out.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.580]   That's all over the pages of the New Testament.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.580]   You can't escape it.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.580]   And one of the problems we have in modern day Christendom
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:58.580]   is people have been hired because of the seminary degree,
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.580]   because of their doctorate,
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.580]   because of, you know, and then they're tall, dark, handsome,
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:06.580]   they can make you cry, all that stuff.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.580]   Or they can tell a good sermon.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.580]   You can have false prophets preach very well.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.580]   So, Titus 1.9.16 also says something similar,
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:19.580]   and this is the other pastoral epistle.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.580]   And this is talking about elders, okay,
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.580]   "But holding fast the faithful word,
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.580]   "which is in accordance with the teaching,
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:30.580]   "so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:34.580]   "and to refute those who contradict."
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.580]   There's a lot of contradictors, okay?
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.580]   "So for there are many rebellious men,
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:42.580]   "empty talkers and deceivers,
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.580]   "especially those of the circumcision,
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.580]   "who must be silenced
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.580]   "because they are upsetting whole families,
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.580]   "teaching things they should not teach
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.580]   "for the sake of sordid gain.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.580]   "And they profess to know God,
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.580]   "but by their deeds they deny him,
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.580]   "being detestable and disobedient
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:04.580]   "and worthless for any good deed.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:06.580]   "Watch your life and doctrine closely,
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.580]   "is a constant theme."
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.580]   Right?
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:13.580]   So I'm gonna take it back to today's passage.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.580]   And I'm just gonna read this, okay?
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.580]   I just hovered over a bunch of stuff,
[01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:21.580]   but let me just read this passage.
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:24.580]   "For many deceivers have gone out into the world,
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:28.580]   "those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ's coming in the flesh.
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:31.580]   "This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.580]   "Watch yourselves,
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.580]   "that you do not lose what we have accomplished,
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.580]   "but that you may receive a full reward.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.580]   "Anyone who goes too far
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:42.580]   "and does not abide in the teaching of Christ
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:44.580]   "does not have God.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.580]   "The one who abides in the teaching,
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:50.580]   "he has both the Father and the Son.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.580]   "If anyone comes to you
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:55.580]   "and does not bring this teaching,
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.580]   "do not receive him into your house.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.580]   "Do not give him a greeting,
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.580]   "for the one who gives him a greeting
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.580]   "participates in his evil deeds."
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:12.580]   And this is the charge to the church.
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.580]   We need to take very seriously
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:18.580]   who we endorse,
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:21.580]   who we empower,
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:25.580]   because there's a lot to lose.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.580]   Right?
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:30.580]   Before I get to the discussion questions,
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:33.580]   just next week is we're in 3 John,
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:35.580]   and it's the first half of it,
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.580]   verses 1 through 7,
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:39.580]   and then the following will be
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.580]   the end of 3 John,
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.580]   and so then we're on to our fourth book of this term,
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.580]   okay, Philemon.
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.580]   In Philemon, we're gonna go uber slow,
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.580]   25 verses, 7 weeks.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.580]   Okay, so we're gonna enjoy.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:58.580]   We're gonna be spending 7 weeks on forgiveness, okay?
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:02.580]   So here are some of the discussion questions.
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.580]   In what specific areas of your life or doctrine--
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.580]   again, you don't have to be a pastor
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.580]   to heed this exhortation--
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:12.580]   so in what specific areas of your life or doctrine
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:16.580]   do you need to pay much closer attention to?
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:19.580]   How can those in your group help you in this?
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:23.580]   Some of you guys are well-meaning,
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:27.580]   but let's say you don't really know the Word of God.
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.580]   You're prone to deception.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.580]   So how do we build toward biblical literacy?
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:35.580]   Some of you guys are entangled.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:40.580]   A lot of times, confession leads to healing.
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.580]   So what are those things that we need
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:46.580]   to really pay or scrutinize in our lives?
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.580]   And number two, what are tangible ways
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.580]   you can help protect our church from the wolves?
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:59.580]   Okay, you can't be like, "Well, I trust our pastors."
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:03.580]   But a lot of times, let's say,
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:08.580]   "Yeah, what can you do to help with that endeavor?"
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.580]   Second, what are the tangible ways
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:13.580]   you can help to encourage the sheep
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.580]   and the shepherds who are in the fold?
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.580]   So that's in 3 John.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.580]   We're going to be talking a lot about that in 3 John.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:23.580]   But what can we do to encourage?
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:26.580]   So what can you do to help fight and guard and defend?
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:30.580]   And then what can you do to build up and strengthen?
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:32.580]   One body, many parts.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.580]   Third, how are you doing in the area of abiding
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:38.580]   in the teachings of Christ?
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.580]   Similar to question number one, but not exactly.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:43.580]   So you can answer it both in one shot,
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:48.580]   or you could answer them just individually.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.580]   All right, let me pray for us,
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:54.580]   and then we'll dismiss to our discussions.
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:59.580]   Father, would you grant us discernment, grant us wisdom?
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   We know, Lord God, with true biblical literacy
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.580]   comes terror, humility, but great compassion.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.580]   So we pray that you would help us
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.580]   to grow biblically literate
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:13.580]   and help us to learn how to apply your truths
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:16.580]   appropriately into our lives
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:18.580]   for the building up of your church,
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:20.580]   for the expansion of your kingdom,
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:23.580]   ultimately just for your glory.
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.580]   So we pray that you would help us
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:29.580]   to really be excited to labor on behalf of this.
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:30.580]   We love you, Lord.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:32.580]   We thank you for your word.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:33.580]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:36.580]   Amen.
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:46.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
