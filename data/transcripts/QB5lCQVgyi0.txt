[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   Welcome to day two.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   This is the Tuesday of Passion Week.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   We are continuing to walk down the path that Jesus took
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   to see the heart of our Savior as he goes on his way
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   to the cross on Good Friday and to resurrection on Sunday.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   Today we're going to be continuing on with that.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   We're going to be led in a time of two songs of praise
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.700]   by Jeremy followed by a testimony,
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.700]   a testimony of faith given by our very own Ryan Chang.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.700]   So before we start this time, I'd like to invite you
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.700]   into a time of prayer together.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.700]   Let's pray.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.700]   Heavenly Father, thank you.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.700]   Thank you that we can gather in such an interesting fashion.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.700]   Lord, many of us here together and for those who are afar,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.700]   we thank you, Lord, for the privilege.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.700]   God, we want to recognize that every time we come to worship,
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   it is not a time set aside for worship that's apart
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.700]   from the rest of our lives, but Lord, a continual worship.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.700]   And God, would you be pleased and satisfied by it?
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.700]   God, would these songs be coming from our hearts
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.700]   or would you help us?
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.700]   Because our hearts must be transformed
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.700]   into the likeness of your son that we might surrender
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.700]   and submit to your will.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.700]   And Father, declare to you that we love you
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.700]   with all our hearts.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.700]   So God, may tonight be filled with meditation of Christ
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.700]   and your word.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.700]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.700]   Amen.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.700]   We all stand for a time of worship.

[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.700]   Hello, my name is Ryan Chang.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.700]   I'm a part of the family ministry here at Berean.
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.700]   I am married to Kate.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.700]   She's my wife sitting right up here in the front.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.700]   I'm thankful for the opportunity to share
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.700]   the story of how God saved me,
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.700]   truly his sovereign work of salvation
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.700]   beyond anything that I deserved.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.700]   I didn't grow up in a Christian household.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.700]   I grew up in South Korea with my parents and my older sister.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.680]   And in the eight years that I lived in Korea,
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.680]   I never stepped my foot in church.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.680]   It wasn't until I came to the United States
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.680]   with my family when I was eight,
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   when I was in about, I think I was third grade,
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   my parents took me to church for the first time.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   And it was mainly so that our family
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.680]   could meet other Korean parents
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   that were living in the United States in our city.
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.680]   And I have some fond memories of church
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   in my elementary years.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.680]   I remember having a lot of fun playing games in Iwana.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   I remember going out to eat with my new friends
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   that I met at church.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   But I don't really remember learning a lot about the Bible.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.680]   And I don't say that to insult the church I was going to,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   but that just wasn't my focus
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   and why I wanted to go to church.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.680]   My family went to that church for about two years
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.680]   and the church unfortunately went through a divisive split
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.680]   and that's when my family stopped going to church.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   When I was in junior high,
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.680]   my friends who were going to a youth group
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.680]   in a different church invited me.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   And again, I went to church for friends.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.680]   So I went for about two years, having fun,
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   going to retreats, meeting new people.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   I had a great time.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   But as I entered into high school,
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.680]   my focus turned towards academics
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.680]   and extracurricular activities to prepare for college.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   So church really became the last priority for me every week.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   If I had enough energy and time left over,
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.680]   then I would consider going to church.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   And so church became a very inconsistent thing in my life.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.680]   And at the same time,
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.680]   I began to see my parents' marriage
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   really coming under strain and stress
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   because of financial hardship.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   And so it was during this time
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   that my dreams and my goals in life were being shaped.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   It came down to money.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   I started to believe during those years
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   that if I have a lot of money,
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   then I can have a happy marriage
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.680]   and more broadly, I can have a happy life.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.680]   And so from that point on forward,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   all my big decisions were made with this question in mind.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   How can I make the most money in the quickest amount of time?
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   That became my driving goal in life.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   And what's scary is, as I look back during that time,
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   if someone asked me if I was a Christian,
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.680]   I probably would have said yes
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   because I knew that there was a God,
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.680]   not the God of the Bible, but a powerful higher being.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   And generally, I lived a better life
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   than a lot of the people that I saw out in the world.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   I had no idea what the gospel was,
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.680]   but that was the basis for why I would call myself a Christian.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   And so as I entered into my college years,
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   I was, in the true sense of the word,
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   hell-bent on becoming rich.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   I chose a college,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.680]   specifically with a good business school,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   and I joined a business fraternity
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   that had a lot of connections to good jobs,
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   and I majored in finance
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   because people told me that finance is the quickest way
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.680]   to a lot of money.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   So I studied hard with a singular goal
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   of working in a finance industry,
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.680]   and that was my fixation
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.680]   for the four and a half years that I was in college.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.680]   And it all seemed to pay off
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.680]   because I did find a job in finance.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.680]   My first job out of college,
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   I moved back to L.A.,
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   and I started working at a firm
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   that seemed to promise the kind of prestigious career
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   and money that I was searching for
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   for many, many years at that point.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.680]   But that initial excitement quickly wore off.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.680]   I was soon working 70, 80 hours a week.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.680]   I was miserable.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   I was tired.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.680]   And I just hated life.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.680]   But even more so than the cost of sleep and health
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.680]   was the cost of falling into a myriad,
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.680]   a Pandora's box of sins that money allowed me.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.680]   I indulged in any kind of sin
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   that I wanted to engage in
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.680]   because I had money.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.680]   And what surprised me at that point
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   was that none of that actually made me happy.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.660]   It actually was just the opposite.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.660]   The more I spent my money
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.660]   and the more I saved money in my bank account,
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.660]   I felt a bigger and bigger gaping hole in my soul.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.660]   So it couldn't really have been any further
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   from my hopes and dreams
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.660]   that money would bring me happiness.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.660]   But for the time being,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.660]   the two years that I was there,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.660]   I suppressed that misery,
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.660]   and I convinced myself that if I just worked really hard
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.640]   for two years, this would be a stepping stone
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   to the next job at a more prestigious company
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.640]   with more money,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   and that's where I'm going to find my happiness.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   I did end up finding that kind of a job
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.640]   after the two years in San Francisco.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   So I moved up to San Francisco
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.640]   with every hope and expectation
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.640]   that I had finally arrived
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   at a place of happiness in my life.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.640]   On the first day that I started on the job,
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   my first thought was,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   "This is the exact same thing
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   with a different label."
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   And just the thought of having to do the two years
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   that I hated so much all over again
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.640]   caused a lot of anxiety in my heart.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   I didn't know what to do with that fear.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   I went home, slept on it,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.640]   came back the second day,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.640]   and my anxiety and fear and disappointment only grew.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.640]   And I actually became angry by the end of the second day
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   because I worked so hard for four years in college
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   and two years at a job that I hated
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.640]   to get to this point.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   By the third day,
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   I didn't know what to think,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.640]   and without thinking,
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.640]   I resigned from the company
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.640]   and I left the building.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   I still distinctly remember
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   myself walking back to my apartment
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.640]   from the building that I was working at.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   I remember thinking,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   "I followed exactly what the world told me to go,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   the path to follow,
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   and this is where I ended up,
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.640]   a complete dead end."
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   It was a total lie.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   And at that point,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.620]   I thought to myself,
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.620]   "If everything that the world told me was a lie,
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.620]   I'm going to try to find an answer
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.620]   in another place."
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.620]   So I thought to myself,
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.620]   "I'm going to go home,
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.620]   and I'm going to read the Bible,
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.620]   the whole Bible,
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.620]   and to see if there's actual, real answers there."
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.620]   And I can't explain to you why in that moment
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.620]   I turned to the Bible
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.620]   other than the fact that
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.620]   this was just God beginning to draw me
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.620]   towards Him through His Word.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.620]   And so as soon as I got back,
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.620]   I opened my dusty Bible
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.620]   that I had never really opened for years,
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.620]   and I turned to Genesis 1-1,
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.620]   and I started reading,
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.620]   and reading,
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.620]   and I kept reading
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.620]   for the next 10 days.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.620]   And all the while I was reading,
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.620]   I was praying to God,
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.620]   "God, if you're really there,
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.620]   this is the time.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.600]   I'm going to ask you to do this.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   I don't know what to do anymore."
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   So as I was reading with a humbled
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   and submissive and searching heart,
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   it was at that point that I understood the Gospel
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   for the very first time in my life
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.600]   after 25 years.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   I recall one passage
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   in the Old Testament,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   and I only recall it very clearly
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   because I wrote it in my journal at that time,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   but this one passage
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.600]   completely shattered my proud heart
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.600]   into a million pieces.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   It was from Jeremiah 17-5.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   It reads,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   "Cursed is the man who trusts in man
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   and makes flesh his strength,
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   whose heart turns away from the Lord.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   He is like a shrub in the desert
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   and shall not see any good come."
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   At that moment,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   I knew I was a cursed man
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   because I lived my whole life
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   for 25 years trusting in myself,
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.600]   and the promises that man gave me,
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   and I trusted in my own strength
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   to find the happiness that I wanted for myself.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   That day, I felt weaker
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   than a shrub without roots
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   that is just gone with the wind.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   But for all that despair
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.600]   that I was feeling at that moment,
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   the Word of God also healed my wounded heart.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   Romans 3 was a beam of light
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.600]   in my dark soul,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.580]   when I realized that
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.580]   I truly am justified by grace
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.580]   as a gift through the redemption
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.580]   that is found in Christ Jesus.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.580]   I had been working
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.580]   all my life for 25 years
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.580]   to earn what I thought was valuable
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.580]   and would make me happy.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.580]   But now I realize that
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.580]   infinitely more
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.580]   and internally valuable gift
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.580]   was given to me
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.580]   as just that, a gift by faith.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.580]   For the first time in my life,
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.580]   I felt peace
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.580]   that I never knew that could exist.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.580]   And I had good reasons to be anxious
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.580]   because I didn't really plan it out
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.580]   when I quit.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.580]   But I wasn't.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.580]   I really wasn't anxious at all.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.580]   And it must have been because I knew
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.580]   that I had obtained
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.580]   that eternally valuable gift,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.580]   the blood of Christ,
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:16.580]   that saved me from my sin.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.580]   I have no doubt that the Word of God
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.580]   is truly living and active.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.580]   This sword laid bare
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.580]   everything in my heart,
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.580]   and it truly was sharp.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.580]   But I'm eternally grateful
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.580]   that this sword didn't simply
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.580]   slay me for my sin,
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.580]   but it caused me to repent
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.580]   and it awakens faith in me,
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.580]   which is why I stand here
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.580]   giving this gracious work of God's
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.580]   testimony in my life.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.580]   Thank you.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:59.580]   (applause)
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.580]   All right.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.580]   Thanks, Ryan, for your testimony.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.580]   And I think that's what
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.580]   we're trying to do here.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.580]   We're trying to see
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.580]   those many years ago
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.580]   how the life of Christ
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.580]   and the death of Christ
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.580]   and the resurrection of Christ
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.580]   applies to people
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.580]   thousands of years later
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.580]   just like Ryan.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.580]   That's what we're doing
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.580]   every single day this week
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.580]   as we get to Tuesday
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.580]   that that wasn't just then,
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.580]   that Jesus was actually actively
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.580]   and intentionally,
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.580]   just as we learned,
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.580]   both on Sunday and yesterday,
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.580]   intentionally moving his way
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.580]   towards the cross
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.580]   so that people like you and me
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.580]   could have life.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.580]   And we're going to be continuing
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.580]   this observation of Jesus'
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.580]   walk on the cross today.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.580]   This is Tuesday
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.580]   and what we see on Tuesday
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.580]   is kind of a heightening
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:51.580]   of this desire
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.580]   for the religious leaders
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.580]   to ensnare and to trap Jesus.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.580]   That's what we're going to see.
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.580]   All these different people
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.580]   that come into play
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.580]   on this Tuesday,
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.580]   interestingly enough,
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.580]   is not going to be Roman soldiers
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.560]   they're not going to be Gentiles
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   or Samaritans.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.560]   It's going to be all different
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.560]   sorts of religious leaders.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   The people who are trying
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.560]   to ensnare Christ
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560]   were the leaders
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   of the people of God.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.560]   They were the people of Israel.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   They were the Pharisees,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.560]   they were scribes,
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   they were these Herodians
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.560]   and Sadducees and priests.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.560]   And the crazy thing is
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.560]   these Jewish sects
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.560]   were usually at odds
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.560]   with each other.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.560]   There was no unity
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.560]   between these people
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.560]   but they were unifying here
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   on this day with the same goal.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.560]   They didn't simply want
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.560]   to trap Jesus,
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.560]   they wanted Jesus dead.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   Jesus knew this.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.560]   He knew that this was
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.560]   on their hearts.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.560]   Jesus knew who these teachers
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   and religious leaders were
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.540]   and they were coming together
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.540]   to kill him.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.540]   Jesus wasn't startled
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.540]   into this realization
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.540]   and they were coming together
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.540]   to kill him.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.540]   It's amazing to see
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   what kind of obstacles
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.540]   can be overcome
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.540]   by the unity of the people of God.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.540]   When we think about
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.540]   what it is for the people of God
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.540]   in the church of God
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.540]   to be unified
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.540]   that overcomes all barriers
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.540]   and obstacles
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.540]   that come united
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.540]   in a single cause
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.540]   of glorifying God
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.540]   and bringing his kingdom.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.520]   That's what we see here today.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   A unity that comes
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.520]   when people,
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   even religious,
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   these people
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   are seemingly morally upright people
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   coming together
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.520]   in their hatred of God.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.520]   Isaiah chapter 29 verse 13.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.520]   I want to direct our attention
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.520]   to this verse
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.520]   because we commonly
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.520]   go to this passage
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.520]   to remember
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   but today let's take
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.520]   a little extra time
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.520]   to remember
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.520]   that this is the people
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.520]   that were being talked about
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.520]   here in Isaiah
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.520]   many, many years ago.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   And it says there
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   "This people draw near me
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.520]   with their words
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.520]   and honor me
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.520]   with their lip service
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.520]   but they remove
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   their hearts far from me
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.520]   and their reverence for me
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   consists of tradition
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.520]   learned by rote."
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.520]   In Psalm chapter 2
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.520]   there's a Psalm there
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   that describes
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   all these nations
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.520]   that are coming together
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.520]   raging together
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.520]   in their unity
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   of their opposition
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.520]   before God.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   And so you're going to have
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.520]   lots of different types
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   of people
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   but anyone who is
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   in opposition to God
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   is not only found there
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   in Psalm 2
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   with all the nations
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   but you see it very clearly here
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   even in the nation of Israel.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.520]   The people that were chosen by God.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   These were people
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.520]   who saw Jesus' miracles.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.520]   They saw his might.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.520]   They saw his kindness.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.520]   They saw how compassionate
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.500]   and gracious
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   and loving he was.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.500]   They saw what he was doing
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   and the power that he came in.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   They saw his spirit filled teaching.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   They were wondering
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:19.500]   who is this man?
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   And after seeing all this
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   they schemed together.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   They turn around
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   and all these different groups
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.500]   of Jewish leaders
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   come together
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   and say
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.500]   how can we kill this man?
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.500]   And this is
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.500]   these are all different groups
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.500]   of people
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   that were looking for
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.500]   some sort of
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   an understanding of God.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.500]   Perhaps waiting for this Messiah
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   for years and years and years
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.500]   and when they finally
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.500]   encounter the man
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.500]   who is systematically
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.500]   fulfilling every
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.500]   single little prophecy
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.500]   that was given
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   in the Old Testament
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.500]   they come across this man
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.500]   and what happens?
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.500]   How can we kill him?
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   They were studying
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.500]   Scripture day by day
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   and when he arrives
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.500]   they're seething in anger.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   They want him
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   not just set aside
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   but they want to annihilate him.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   They want him to be dead.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.500]   They actually actively plot
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   not just his death
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   but they're plotting
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.500]   his murder.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   How can we kill him?
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.500]   You see the intention there?
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   How can we kill him?
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   They overcome
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.500]   great obstacles and barriers
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.500]   and unify before this Jesus
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.500]   not to worship and love him
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.500]   but to kill him.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.500]   And here is this Messiah Jesus
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   who imposes a threat
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.500]   on what they truly want.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.500]   This is a kingdom
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   that they want for themselves.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   This is a world
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.500]   that revolves around them.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.500]   This is a desire to say
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   that I want to live
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.500]   on that throne.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.500]   I want to live as God.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.500]   So on this day
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   of Passion Week
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   on this Tuesday
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.500]   this is what is heightening.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.500]   They are scheming
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.500]   to get him to that cross
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.500]   to kill him.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.500]   The people who say Lord, Lord
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   are the very ones
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.500]   who are out to ensnare
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   and murder Christ.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.500]   Jesus knew all of this.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.500]   Think about that.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   Jesus was encountering
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.500]   these people
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.500]   and he knew exactly
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   what they were doing.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.500]   Jesus who came down
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.500]   and loved to his people
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.500]   to extend a hand of grace
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.500]   and mercy to his people.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.500]   To spend an entire
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.500]   earthly lifetime
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.500]   wanting nothing more
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.500]   for them to come to know him.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.500]   To describe to them
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.500]   that I am he
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.500]   you have been waiting for.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   He has been praying for them.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   He has been teaching them.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   He has been hoping
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500]   for them to know.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.500]   He has condescended
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.500]   to humanity
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.500]   and their response
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   isn't to surrender.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   Their response isn't love
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.500]   or awe.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   It isn't even neglect
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.500]   or ignorance.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   It is how can we kill him.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.500]   I am saying this over
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.500]   and over for a reason
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.500]   because that is what
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.500]   we are moving towards here
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.500]   on this Passion Week.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.500]   Because that is
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.500]   the inevitable end
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.500]   of the sinner.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   That we want to kill him.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.500]   And on this Tuesday morning
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.500]   Jesus and the disciples
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   wake up in Bethany
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   and they head back
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   to Jerusalem and the Temple.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.500]   And on the way
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   to Jerusalem
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.500]   they see the withered tree.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.500]   The fig tree
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.500]   that we heard about yesterday.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   And they are reminded
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   of what happens
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.500]   to trees that don't produce fruit.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.500]   We can't go into that too much
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   but I was describing
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.500]   the nation.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.500]   And upon reaching
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   the Temple in Jerusalem
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.500]   this is what it says
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   in Matthew Chapter 21
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.500]   Verse 23.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   We have it written up for you.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   It says when he,
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.500]   when Jesus entered the Temple
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   the chief priest
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.500]   and the elders of the people
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.500]   came to him
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   while he was teaching.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.500]   And so Jesus,
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   he sees while he is teaching
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   inside of the Temple
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.500]   these religious leaders
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   are coming
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.500]   and he knows exactly
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.500]   why they are coming.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.500]   They are ready to ensnare
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.500]   and trap him today
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   on this Tuesday.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.500]   Especially after
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.500]   what he did yesterday.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.500]   Man, think about
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.500]   what happens.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.500]   Sometimes when you get
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.500]   a good night of sleep
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   sometimes it helps you
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   to let the emotions subside.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.500]   Sometimes it helps you
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.500]   to rile up even more.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   And they are riled up.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.500]   And they are seeking blood.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.500]   Jesus is a great threat
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.500]   to them.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.500]   To their desires.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.500]   For their worldly kingdom.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.480]   And if God is the means
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   they need to go through
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   to obtain their kingdom
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.480]   then so be it.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.480]   They want what they want.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.480]   God and his kingdom
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   is not their end here.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.480]   Their own kingdom
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   is their end.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   They attach God's name to it
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.480]   but it's their own kingdom.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.480]   Their own desire and will.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   And you see it immediately
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.480]   in their very first exchange.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.480]   In Matthew chapter 21 verse 23
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   they ask a question of Jesus
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   and they ask
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.480]   by what authority
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   are you doing these things
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   and who gave you this authority?
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   Now anyone with a mustard seed
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   just a small amount of faith
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   should be able to look at
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   what Jesus was doing
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   and connect the dots.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.480]   They ought to know
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   by whose authority Jesus comes.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   This is the Messiah.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   But because they don't
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.480]   like the message
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   because they don't like the fact
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   that when he says
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.480]   he is the king
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.480]   it is not the type of king
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.480]   they were thinking of
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   the king that would bring
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   about my kingdom
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   but his.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   The fact that he's saying
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   he is the Lord
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.480]   he is the master
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   what happens is
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   they refuse to submit.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.480]   They don't bow the knee
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   and so they ask a question
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.480]   that's not really a question
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.480]   they ask
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.480]   by whose authority do you come?
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.480]   The true answer
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   will never satisfy them.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   So Jesus says to them
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   I'm not going to tell you.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   Why?
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   Because you already know
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.480]   but you refuse to believe
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.480]   and so he says in Matthew 21, 27
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.480]   neither will I tell you
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   by what authority
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   I do these things
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   and this is recognizable
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.480]   to us today
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.480]   because it's always been like this
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   with sinful man
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.480]   always.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   It's never changed.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.480]   God has always been used
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.480]   as a means to the end
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.480]   of the sinful man.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   Rather than submit
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.480]   to his authority
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   we ask him to bend
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.480]   to my authority.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.480]   So we ask
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.480]   by whose authority do you come?
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   Think of the ridiculousness
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   of that.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.480]   As Jesus
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   the creator
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   stands before his people
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   and the people are asking him
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:29.480]   by whose authority do you come?
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.480]   It's astonishing.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.480]   See this
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   we understand this
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.480]   because we will pray to God
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.480]   we will worship God
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   but only as much as it is
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.480]   to establish my own kingdom.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   The Lord's prayer for us
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.480]   is our father in heaven
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   hallowed be my name
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   make my kingdom come
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.480]   make my will be done
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   that's how we actually pray.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   And this is what was happening
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   with the Israelite leaders
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   and Jesus came to show
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.480]   that he had enough of this
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.480]   before he goes to the cross.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   This Tuesday
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.480]   is when Jesus makes
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   his clearest rebuke
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   against these leaders.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   Jesus goes into many parables
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.460]   to begin to describe to them
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.460]   in increasing clarity
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.460]   who they are.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.460]   And we'll focus
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.460]   on just two parables.
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.460]   Here's the first
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.460]   the vineyard landowner.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.460]   This is the first parable.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.460]   Jesus tells this parable
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.460]   of a vineyard landowner
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.460]   who goes on a journey
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.460]   and before he leaves
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.460]   he rented it out
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.460]   to people who would keep the land
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:30.460]   and to pay him his share.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.460]   But what he would do is
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.460]   he would send these slaves
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.460]   to these renters
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.460]   to these people
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.460]   who are renting the land
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.460]   to collect from the produce
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.460]   that they were gathering from.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.460]   But with every slave
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.460]   he sends to receive
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.460]   some of the produce
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.460]   of his vineyard
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.460]   it says they beat them
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:54.460]   and they kill them.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.460]   He says.
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.460]   He sends a slave
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.460]   and they beat them
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.460]   and kill them.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.460]   He sends another one
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.460]   and he beats them
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.460]   and kills them.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.460]   He sends another one
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.460]   and he beats them
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.460]   and kills them.
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.460]   Slave after slave
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:12.460]   kill.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.460]   Stand in awe
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.460]   at the incredible nature
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.460]   of the patience
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.460]   of this landowner.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.460]   It's almost mind blowing.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.460]   How many slaves
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.460]   are you going to send?
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.460]   He just keeps killing them.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.460]   What do you do?
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.460]   This man's patience
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.460]   is incredible here right?
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.460]   That doesn't end.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.460]   He says maybe
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.460]   if I send my own son
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.460]   they will listen.
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.460]   This isn't foolishness.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.460]   This is incredible
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.460]   patience and love
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.460]   and graciousness,
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.460]   kindness.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.460]   He sends his very own son.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:52.460]   This means by the way
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.460]   that this is the inheritor.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.460]   This is if the landowner
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.460]   is sending his own son.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.460]   This is the very man
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.460]   who is one day going
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:14.460]   to inherit all of it.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.460]   And the sinful heart
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.460]   is laid bare
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.460]   of these religious leaders.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.460]   Here it is in one statement
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.460]   the sinful man's heart and tent
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.460]   in verse 38 of chapter 21.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.460]   They say
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.460]   they scheme together
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.460]   all these people.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.460]   This is the heir.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   Come.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.460]   Let us kill him.
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.460]   And what?
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.460]   Seize his inheritance.
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.460]   Jesus is telling them
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.460]   this parable
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.460]   because he knows.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.460]   He knows through and through
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.460]   what's going on in their hearts.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.460]   And when Jesus asked
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.460]   the Jewish leaders
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:54.460]   what the landowner will do
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.460]   when they kill this son
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.460]   which they do.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.460]   They kill the son
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.460]   so that they can have
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.460]   the inheritance
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.460]   which doesn't even make sense.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.440]   It's almost eerie
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   how well the religious leaders
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   are able to answer
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   what the landowner
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.440]   is going to do.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.440]   In verse 41
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.440]   just three verses after
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.440]   the religious leader said to him
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.440]   he, the landowner,
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.440]   will bring those wretches
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.440]   to a wretched end
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   and will rent out the vineyard
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.440]   to other vine growers
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.440]   who will pay in the proceeds
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.440]   at the proper season.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   And then in verse 45
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.440]   it says when the chief priest
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.420]   and the Pharisees
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.420]   heard his parables
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.420]   they understood.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:40.420]   They understood
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:45.420]   that he was talking about them.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.420]   Now there's many more parables
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:47.420]   but here's another one, okay?
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.420]   The wedding feast
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.420]   is the second
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.420]   and last parable
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.420]   we're going to go into.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.420]   Jesus goes on to tell
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.420]   another parable.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.420]   A king holds
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.420]   a wedding feast for his son
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.420]   and so now we've moved
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.420]   from a landowner to what?
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.420]   A king.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.420]   Matthew is all about
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.420]   the kingdom and the king.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.420]   Okay, now we're getting
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.420]   increasing clarity here.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.420]   Now the parable
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.420]   is about a king
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.420]   and he's holding
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.420]   a wedding feast for his son
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.420]   and he sends his slaves
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.420]   out to call those
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.420]   who have been invited
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.420]   to the wedding feast
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.420]   but the people
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.420]   are unwilling to come.
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.420]   And so again
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.420]   the king sends other slaves
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.420]   with more information.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.420]   By the way,
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.420]   if you haven't caught on yet
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.420]   these slaves,
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.420]   these servants that are being sent out
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   are alluding to the prophets of old
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.420]   sent to the nation of Israel
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.400]   and in Matthew 22, verse 4,
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   it says,
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   "Tell those who have been invited,
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   'Behold, I have prepared my dinner,
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   my oxen and my fattened livestock
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.400]   are all butchered
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.400]   and everything is ready.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   Come to the wedding feast."
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   It's to enjoy.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.400]   But without going
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   into the text itself
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.400]   let me just explain to you
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   but those invited
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.400]   pay no attention
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   because they don't care
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   about the king.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.400]   Instead, this is what Jesus says.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.400]   He describes them, okay?
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.400]   He says, number one,
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.400]   one owned a farm.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.400]   Number two,
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   one owned a business
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   and they said,
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.400]   "I have this to tend to
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   so I cannot come."
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   And thirdly,
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   anyone else that's remaining
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   sees the slaves
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   and here it is again,
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   they killed them.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.400]   Kill.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.400]   They want their own life
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.400]   according to their own terms.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   They don't care about
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   the kingdom of the king.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.400]   They care about
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   their very own kingdom.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   They actually want
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   nothing to do with God,
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   nothing to do with him.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.400]   They want to live
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.400]   their own lives
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.400]   and remember that
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   all these things
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.400]   are describing
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   these Jewish leaders,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   the most religious people
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   in Israel
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.400]   and he's speaking to them
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.400]   in the temple
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   in Jerusalem.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.400]   But this is what
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   they're willing to do
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   because they honor God
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.400]   with the lips.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   They say with their lips
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.400]   that they love God
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.380]   and they worship God
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.380]   but they don't really.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.380]   They actually want
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.380]   to live their own lives.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.380]   They want their own kingdom
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.380]   and so when the Messiah comes
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.380]   and he does not say
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.380]   he's going to deliver
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.380]   to them what they want,
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.380]   they turn.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.380]   Do they just turn a blind eye?
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.380]   No.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.380]   They seethe.
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.380]   They want him dead.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.380]   That's what's happening
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.380]   on this Tuesday
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.380]   and Jesus knows
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.380]   and he's taking painstaking time
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.380]   to explain to them
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:41.380]   what they are.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.380]   You might see
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.380]   all this rebuke
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.380]   but rebuke done
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.380]   by the sinless son of God,
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.380]   man, this is love I think.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.380]   This is grace.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.380]   He's showing
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.380]   that this is who you are.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:03.380]   Do you not see it?
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.380]   They say Lord, Lord,
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.380]   did we not do all these things
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.380]   in your name?
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:07.380]   One day Jesus will stare them
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.380]   back in the eye unflinching
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:13.380]   and say I never knew you.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.380]   The kingdom is reserved
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.380]   for those who love the Lord
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.380]   and live for him.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.380]   The kingdom does not house people
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:22.380]   who live for their own glory
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.380]   and so what is the result?
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.380]   The king in this parable
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.380]   sends his armies,
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.380]   destroys the murderers
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:32.380]   and sets their city on fire
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.380]   and then the king
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   sends his slaves
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.380]   to the main highways
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.380]   inviting anyone
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.380]   who would come into the wedding.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.380]   Those previously uninvited.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.380]   The kingdom is reserved
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.380]   for those of faith.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.380]   It does not matter
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:43.380]   what you look like
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.380]   on the outside.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.380]   The kingdom is for those
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.380]   who have placed their faith
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.380]   in God and give their lives
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.380]   over to God.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.380]   It's for the ones
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.380]   who have traded in all things
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.380]   for the king.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:52.380]   It's not for those
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.380]   who put up a religious show
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:55.360]   but it's for those
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:01.360]   who live for him.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   So he's been teaching
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   all day at this temple
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.360]   and he concludes
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   after a full day's work done
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   Jesus caps it all off
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   as if there were any question
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.360]   as to the message to stay
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.360]   in Matthew chapter 23.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   Let me read to us
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.360]   verse 2 to 7.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.360]   The scribes and the Pharisees
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.360]   have seated themselves
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.360]   in the chair of Moses.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.360]   Therefore all that they tell you
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.360]   do and observe
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.360]   but do not do according
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.360]   to their deeds
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.340]   for they say things
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.340]   and do not do them.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.340]   They tie up heavy burdens
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:28.340]   and lay them on men's shoulders
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.340]   but they themselves
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.340]   are unwilling to move them
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.340]   with so much as a finger
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.340]   but they do all their deeds
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.340]   to be noticed by men
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.340]   for they broaden their phylacteries
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.340]   and lengthen the tassels
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.340]   of their garments.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.340]   They love the places
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.340]   of honor at banquets
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.340]   and the chief seats
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.340]   in the synagogues
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.340]   and respectful greetings
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.340]   in the marketplaces
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.340]   and being called rabbi by men.
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.340]   And when I hear
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.340]   these words of Jesus
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.340]   all I can hear is
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.340]   their kingdom,
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.340]   their kingdom,
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.340]   their kingdom.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.340]   That's all I can hear in that.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.340]   And so what he does
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.340]   is pronounces woe
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.340]   which is an exclamation of grief
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.340]   and you can think of it like this.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.340]   Woes mean
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.340]   how greatly one will suffer.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.340]   When he says
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.340]   pronounces a woe
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.340]   is what terrible pain will come.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.340]   It means how horrible
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.340]   it will be.
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.340]   And he says
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.340]   woe to the scribes
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   and Pharisees.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.340]   He says it seven times.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.340]   Woe, in verse 13,
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.340]   woe to the scribes
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.340]   and Pharisees, hypocrites.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.340]   In verse 14,
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.340]   woe to the scribes
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.340]   and Pharisees, hypocrites.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.340]   In verse 15,
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.340]   woe to you scribes
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:21.340]   and Pharisees, hypocrites.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.340]   Verse 16,
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.340]   woe to you blind guides.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.320]   Verse 23, woe to you
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.320]   Verse 25, verse 27,
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.320]   verse 29, verbatim,
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.320]   woe to you scribes
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.320]   and Pharisees, hypocrites.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.320]   He's saying
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   how horrible
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.320]   it will be for you
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.320]   that judgment is being stored
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.320]   and Jesus is making it clear
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.320]   that the proud and arrogant,
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   you are not victims.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   This will be just recompense
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.320]   for your sin.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.320]   They are hard-hearted people
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.320]   who are bringing judgment
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.320]   upon themselves.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   He has spent this time
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.320]   exposing who they are
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   and what their heart is like
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.300]   and they have proud
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.300]   and arrogant hearts
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.300]   that do not submit to Jesus
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.300]   as he's saying this.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.300]   Jesus is standing before them
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:04.300]   preaching his heart out
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:09.300]   filled with desire.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.300]   The King that has come
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.300]   and all they want
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.300]   is for Jesus
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.300]   to fit their own agenda
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.300]   and now because he does not
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   fulfill that,
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   they want to eliminate the threat
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.300]   and so they go and scheme.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.300]   It is intentional.
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.300]   God has been patient
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.300]   in his desire
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.300]   to extend his grace and mercy
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.300]   for years and years and years
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.300]   and so in verse 34,
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.300]   he says therefore,
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.300]   this is right after all the woes,
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.300]   woe, woe, woe, woe, woe
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.300]   to all of you.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:42.300]   He says therefore, therefore,
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.300]   the only therefore
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.300]   in this whole passage, okay.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.300]   He says therefore behold,
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.300]   I am sending you prophets
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.300]   and wise men, scribes,
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.300]   some of them you will kill
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.300]   and crucify,
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.300]   some of them you will scourge
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.300]   in your synagogues
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.300]   and persecute from city to city
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.300]   so that upon you
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.300]   may fall the guilt
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.300]   of all the righteous bloodshed
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.300]   on earth
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.300]   from the blood of righteous Abel
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.300]   to the blood of Zechariah.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.300]   The Jewish Bible
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.300]   started with Genesis,
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.300]   ended with 2 Chronicles
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.300]   and these were the front
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.300]   and the end,
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.300]   the bookends of prophets
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.300]   that were given
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.300]   that you will kill them all
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:15.300]   and in verse 37,
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.300]   he cries out Jerusalem, Jerusalem
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.300]   who kills the prophets
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.300]   and stones those
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.300]   who are sent to her.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.300]   How often I wanted
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.300]   to gather your children together
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.300]   the way a hen gathers
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.300]   her chicks under her wings
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.300]   and you were unwilling.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.300]   Behold your house
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.300]   is being left to you desolate.
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.300]   See Jesus' heart
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.300]   is filled here.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:37.300]   He's not mean.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.300]   He's incredibly sad.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:44.300]   He is angry.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.300]   So on the way home,
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.300]   back to Bethany
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:48.300]   on this Tuesday,
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.300]   they stop by
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.300]   the Mount of Olives.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.300]   They go up
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.300]   and it's a place
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.300]   as the sun is going down
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.300]   where they could look
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.300]   out across the whole city.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.300]   They can see it
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   and Jesus begins
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.300]   to go into the Olivet Discourse.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.300]   If you're unfamiliar with that,
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.300]   it's where he starts
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.300]   talking about the end
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:12.300]   and what it will look like.
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.300]   Jesus describes
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.300]   the persecution,
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.300]   the tribulation,
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.300]   the judgment that happened
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.300]   not only to the prophets of old
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.300]   but to those who will continue,
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.300]   the people of the kingdom.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.300]   That those who are willing
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.300]   to kill God
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.300]   will most definitely
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.300]   kill his servants.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.300]   And God's ultimate judgment
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.300]   is coming
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.300]   and he warns them.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.300]   It is being reserved
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.300]   but it's only for a time
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.300]   and right now
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.300]   is still a time of grace.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.300]   He warns them
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.300]   because he loves them
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.300]   and he warns them
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.300]   and he sends them out
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.300]   with this warning
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.300]   so that the church,
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.300]   the church can deliver this.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.300]   Right now is still
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.300]   a time of grace
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.300]   but the call is still
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.300]   to seek the Lord
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.300]   while he may be found
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   and that is why
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.300]   we can celebrate Passion Week,
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.300]   Good Friday,
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.300]   Resurrection Sunday
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:02.300]   every single year
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.300]   because we are still existing
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:09.300]   in a time of God's patient grace.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.300]   If you have friends
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.300]   and family who do not know Christ,
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.300]   bring them.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.300]   Bring them on Friday.
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:15.300]   Bring them on Sunday
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.300]   that they might come to know him.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.300]   Would you take a moment now
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.300]   to pray.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.300]   We're going to just give you
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.300]   maybe three or four minutes or so
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.300]   to pray thinking about
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.300]   Jesus standing before
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.300]   these religious leaders
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.300]   and take the time
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   to see how closely
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.300]   our hearts resemble
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.300]   and mimic these religious leaders,
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.300]   to confess our sins,
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:42.300]   to repent of our selfish
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.300]   and self-centered ways
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:44.300]   and to see it as more
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.300]   as flaws or wayward living
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.300]   but see it as what it is,
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.300]   a desire for the elimination
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.300]   of God in our lives.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.300]   Our repentance needs to match
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.300]   what our sin actually is.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.300]   So take this time to pray.

[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.240]   of what a wonderful Jesus you sent to us.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.240]   Oh God, thank you.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   Thank you so much for your sacrifice.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:11.240]   Thank you, Lord, that we can really appreciate this week who you are
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.240]   and what you did.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:18.240]   And Father, I pray that we would not be people who just say that you are the Lord,
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   you are God, but Father, we would be able to say with increasing conviction,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   you are my Lord and you are my God.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.240]   Father, that we might not delude ourselves into thinking we follow you
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.240]   when in fact we follow our own making of you.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.240]   Forgive us, God.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.240]   Accept our repentance.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:46.240]   And I pray, Lord, that when we say your kingdom come, we love you so much,
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   we understand our place before you enough to say that your kingdom is my kingdom.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   So thank you, Lord.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   Thank you for every night that we can spend here together.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.240]   And I pray, Father, that we would continue to edify each other,
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   encourage each other until the day Christ returns.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.240]   Amen.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.240]   All right, thank you everyone for coming.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.240]   We'll see you again tomorrow night, same time.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.220]   [Applause]
