[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020]   [ Silence ]
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.620]   >> We went over, or the chapters.
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.860]   So if you look at it, there are four chapters every single day.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.620]   Okay? So that's a lot of reading.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.380]   So the assignment for every single day,
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.860]   and I hope you guys will take advantage.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.700]   I know it's a lot of chapters.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.400]   It's four chapters, but I know just talking to a few of you
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.520]   that some of you guys are already a little bit lost.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.420]   Right? So we want to review so that when we pick back
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.400]   up next time in chapter, I think, 21.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.020]   We're going up to chapter 19, but I'm going to have you guys go
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.680]   up to chapter 20, because 20 is kind of connected to 19.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.520]   Then when we get back together, we're going to start
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.400]   on chapter 21.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.460]   Okay? So especially those of you guys who kind of jumped
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.080]   in in the middle, and those of you guys who feel like, man,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.600]   we're like, one week we're talking about the end times,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.060]   next week we're talking about Assyria, and you know,
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.460]   you kind of want to catch up.
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.700]   Again, I want to make it clear to you for your --
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.320]   just for clarity, if you are lost as far as a theme,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.220]   you know, what theme is being carried out,
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.980]   it's okay to be lost.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.480]   Okay? Because Isaiah is not written like, oh, chapter 1,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.520]   2, 3 is about this, and then it builds to the next one.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.640]   The subjects are sometimes completely different.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.820]   In fact, the time -- even the time that Isaiah is talking
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.580]   about will sometimes jump to the end times,
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.280]   and then it'll come back, talks about Assyria,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.900]   and then it goes to Babylonia, and then it comes back to Assyria.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.460]   So it's not a consecutive thing.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.420]   So if you -- if we're studying up to chapter 20,
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.680]   it's like, you know what, I kind of lost, you know,
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.340]   it's not like math or chemistry
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340]   where you didn't understand the first three chapters,
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.420]   I don't know where this is going.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.120]   So every week that we're studying, you kind of have
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.200]   to study it independently.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.120]   Okay? There's no clear connection
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.400]   to what he said before and what he said afterwards.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.900]   When you look at the big picture, the 66 chapters,
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.280]   there's some thematic things that kind of hold together,
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.800]   but they're not done in a systematic way where it's
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.100]   like chapter 1, you know, is the judgment,
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.920]   chapter 2 is this, chapter 3 is that.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.660]   So if you feel like, you know, we're in chapter 19,
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.740]   and we talked about this, and then three days,
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.220]   three weeks ago we talked about that,
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.120]   and I don't know how they'd all connect together, don't worry.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.920]   They're not, they don't all connect together.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.340]   Some connect, some don't connect.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.600]   So you don't have to, when you're studying Isaiah,
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.540]   you don't have to think that way.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.920]   You don't have to think like, well, you know,
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.440]   Thessalonians chapter 1, and then chapter 2,
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.520]   chapter 3 builds on this, and this is a theme that kind
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.460]   of unites it all together.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.880]   That's not how Isaiah is written.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.900]   Okay? Isaiah is, the large theme is about salvation of mankind
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.480]   and the coming of the Messiah as a solution
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.600]   to the problem of mankind.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.720]   But how that's presented is very choppy.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.940]   Okay? So what I want you to do in preparation
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.840]   for next week's overview study is just to go back and read it.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.560]   So every day you have four chapters.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.100]   Now when I ask you, on top of it you'll see
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.680]   that it says outline.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.100]   Okay? I'm not asking you to outline verse 1 and 2 is this,
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.740]   3 and 4, that'll take you, you know, too long.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.540]   What I'm asking you to do is just read it,
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.100]   and then you're going to see large sections.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.380]   Oh, he's talking about Assyria in verses 1 through 18.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.320]   Right? I just want you to see the large outline so
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.800]   that in each chapter there should be no more than about 2
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.160]   or 3 outlines in each chapter.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.460]   So you'll just read it.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.880]   So if you can't do it all in one sitting, maybe do, you know,
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.200]   one or two chapters in the morning, and then come back
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.100]   at night and do one or two chapters at night.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.140]   So that way, by the time you come here next week,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.040]   you'll kind of have some, a general flow in your head
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.920]   as to the first 20 chapters.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.460]   Okay? So that when we review it, we're just going
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.260]   to reinforce what you've already done.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.200]   All right?
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.700]   So I really want you guys to take advantage of the fact
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.020]   that we're kind of going back and reviewing.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.660]   So especially those of you who jumped in the middle or those
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.900]   of you that are coming, you know, every other week,
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.940]   it'll kind of help you to see, to see some kind of, you know,
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.180]   that these are the subjects and these are the things
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.080]   that we've been talking about.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.240]   Okay? The large picture
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.020]   of Isaiah, the first section goes all the way to chapter 39.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.500]   It's about the judgment of God.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.680]   Right? And then, remember we talked about it last week
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.240]   that, that you know how he,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.420]   he's specifically mentioning certain nations, like Damascus,
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.900]   Assyria, Philistia, that is going to continue
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.960]   up to chapter 23.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.060]   But the larger theme of judgment, because of sin,
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.360]   is going to go all the way to verse, chapter 39,
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.300]   generally speaking.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.400]   And then starting from chapter 40, you're going
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.340]   to see a slight, you know, change where there's,
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.660]   there was a lot more hope.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.540]   Right? First 39 chapters is a lot of,
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.320]   you're being judged for this reason.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.740]   This is how judgment is going to come.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.120]   This is what judgment is going to look like.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.840]   This is what it's going to look like after you're judged.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.480]   This is why you're being judged.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.440]   That's 39 chapters.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.920]   Starting from chapter 40 is there's a lot more emphasis
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.860]   on the solution.
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.220]   Right? All the way to chapter 66.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.220]   So if you think of any particular outline,
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.340]   that's the outline that I want you guys to have in your head.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.560]   First section, judgment.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.700]   Second section, hope.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.540]   Okay? And then within the first section, there's,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.020]   he goes into detail.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.980]   Well, this judgment is to the nation of Israel.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.680]   This judgment is the nation of Syria.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.640]   This judgment is for, you know, putting confidence in man.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.880]   This judgment is for idolatry.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.700]   Right? This judgment is for false religion.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.940]   Right? And so he goes into detail,
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.300]   all the thematically that way.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.520]   But under the larger, chapter 4, connect to chapter 10,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.280]   you know, what does chapter 13 have to do with chapter 19?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.260]   You don't have to worry about that.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.860]   Okay? Isaiah, you don't study it that way.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.600]   When you New Testament, you have to study it that way.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.780]   Okay? And then the memory verses too.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.860]   I'm, I didn't add any memory verses.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.980]   And I know that most of you probably have been trying
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.140]   to do it cumulatively.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.260]   So I'm just asking you guys to review the verses.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.160]   Okay? So don't wait until the last day and then come
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.660]   and then review all of it all at once.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.500]   So try this week to go back
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   and just review a few verses every week
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.140]   so that when you come back.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.120]   I know you guys are, you know, you guys,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.160]   all of you have been very diligent in memorizing.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.580]   I know that for a fact.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.500]   Right? So I'm very encouraged to see all of it.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.120]   But next week, just kind of solidify it.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.620]   All right?
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.900]   Okay. So let me pray first and we'll jump in.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:33.840]   Abba Father, we thank you so much for this evening.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.740]   We thank you, Lord God, for your living word.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.740]   We thank you for your patience and love
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.800]   that compels us, Lord God, to come and study,
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.940]   to learn, to get a greater glimpse of Christ and his work.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.140]   We pray, Father God, that as we truly have a cloud
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.920]   of witnesses that have gone before us,
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.620]   people who have succeeded, people who have failed.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.320]   We know, Father God, in the midst of chaos
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.900]   and rebellion in history,
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.420]   that you've been faithful all this time.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.540]   And so we pray, Father, as we study the history of Israel
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.640]   and and your thoughts behind what is happening,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.580]   what has happened and and your hope
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.980]   that you give, Lord God, in the context
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.480]   that all of these things would give insight, Lord,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.120]   into where we are in our history and and to learn from mistakes
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.980]   and learn from good examples
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.180]   and that you would cause us, Lord, to grow and to mature
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.280]   as a result. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.320]   All right.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.760]   So the first part, Isaiah.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.640]   The. OK, can somebody go check this?
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:57.620]   [ Pause ]
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:15.620]   [ Pause ]
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.940]   >> Okay. Brian, did somebody take that out?
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.220]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.580]   Oh, okay. That's-- okay, okay. No, it's working now.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.400]   Okay. All right.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.360]   So let's get the first section, Isaiah 17, 1 through 6.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.580]   First question, against what two nations does Isaiah prophesy
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.520]   in Chapter 17?
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.860]   The two nations, obviously,
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.260]   to be playing Damascus and Ephraim, okay.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.760]   We talked about this in the beginning.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.500]   Damascus is the city for what nation?
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.740]   Syria. And Ephraim is another word for--
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.280]   Israel, but Northern Kingdom, right?
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.300]   So the Northern Kingdom is where all the 10 tribes went,
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.160]   and then the Southern Kingdom is where the two tribes--
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.040]   do you remember the two tribes that went to the south?
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.080]   Benjamites and Judah, okay.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.680]   So Benjamites and Judah.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.900]   So Ephraim is another name for the Northern Kingdom,
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.260]   the 10 tribes, right.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:26.480]   So the judgment is pertaining to these two nations.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.540]   And the background is these two nations conspired
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.220]   against Israel, okay.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.380]   Israel meaning the Southern Kingdom because they refused
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.920]   to join their alliance against Assyria.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.620]   Remember, we talked about that, I think,
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.100]   in the beginning, Chapter 1 or 2.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.300]   So again, remember, we-- he talked about it in the beginning,
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.220]   and he's bringing it back up again, right.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.500]   So it's not necessarily a consecutive, like,
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.200]   argument building one upon another.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.040]   There should be somewhere on the table somewhere.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.820]   I don't have any more here.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.240]   Anybody have extra on the table?
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.980]   Okay. All right.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.100]   So that's the background behind the judgment
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.140]   against these two nations
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.020]   because they weren't necessarily natural friends.
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.160]   The only reason why they're trying to conspire is
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.580]   because you know how they have a superpower, Assyria,
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.620]   and so the historical background behind what's going
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.500]   on here is a lot of these little nations are making alliances
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.900]   to-- because they can't fight Assyria by themselves, okay.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.700]   And we're going to see that Ethiopia plays a part
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.380]   in this later on as well as Egypt, okay.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.520]   But right now, that's the background behind it
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.780]   where they're-- they want--
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.320]   they come to the Southern Kingdom saying, "Hey, join us."
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.620]   But instead, instead of joining them, who do they join?
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.900]   They conspire with, right, the Southern Kingdom doesn't join
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.920]   with them, right.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.380]   And so they become angry.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.020]   And then they say, "Well, we're not going to join us.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.720]   We're going to attack you.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.880]   You're our enemy," right.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.280]   So what does the judgment say that's going to happen to them?
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.620]   Okay. Damascus is going to be ruined
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.340]   and no descendants will remain.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.640]   Remember, I think Laura asked that question last week,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.040]   the Syria, you know, all the news coming out of Syria,
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.140]   is that connected to this Syria, right?
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.160]   You know, years ago before the internet,
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.860]   that would have taken at least months to answer.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.500]   I would have had to go to school, look it up,
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.200]   ask a genius, you know what I mean, or somebody who's
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.600]   like trivia genius.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.020]   All I had to do is go to the office and Google,
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.260]   "Is Syria that Syria?"
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.440]   And then the answer was, "No, it is not," okay.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.400]   So basically, this Syria that we're talking about,
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.440]   exactly as God says, later on, the Babylonians actually come in
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.200]   and they conquer them and they're gone.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.900]   From that time on, that particular kingdom is gone.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.780]   The Syria that we're talking about in modern history,
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.340]   they were only newly developed after World War II.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.240]   So those two nations may have the same name because it's
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.840]   in the same region, but it's not the same kingdom
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.540]   that came continuously, okay.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.980]   Just like this prophecy, God says, "Because of your sin,
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.680]   God's going to wipe out your nation," right?
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:12.560]   Otter destruction without any trace
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.260]   of descendants is going to be wiped out.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.060]   The fortress of Ephraim will be gone
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.000]   and their glory will be no more.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.200]   Their security will be taken away
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.840]   and their glory will be no more, in verse 3.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.580]   So basically, it's saying that Ephraim is not going
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.280]   to be destroyed.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.240]   Ephraim is because they're part of Israel,
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.220]   but their glory is going to be diminished.
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.420]   So there's a reason.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.420]   Remember when Paul, in the New Testament, when he brags about
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.520]   or he's kind of like, "Hey, you want to go toe to toe
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.120]   with these legalists and, you know, who's got what?"
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.960]   And remember one of the first things Paul says, "I'm a what?
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.000]   I'm an Israelite from the tribe of Benjamin," right?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.900]   Because it was kind of bragging rights.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.900]   So if you were a part of the southern kingdom, it was shame
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.840]   because you were part of that nation that broke away
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.880]   from God's covenant people, right?
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.380]   So he says, "Ephraim, you're, you know, anybody who belongs
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.120]   to that kingdom, you know, in Israel's history,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.580]   they were on the wrong side."
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.580]   Right? So he said, "Your glory is going to disappear.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.580]   Your security is going to disappear."
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.560]   Right? Uh-huh?
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:30.600]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   Well, Damascus, again, it's just the name of the city.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:41.580]   So under, during a period of Rome, it was under Roman Empire.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.580]   So the city exists.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.580]   But the nation of Syria is destroyed.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.580]   Yeah. So Syria is no longer in control.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.580]   Here it just says Damascus in reference to Syria.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.580]   Okay. Uh-huh.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.580]   Yes?
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:01.600]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   Here?
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   Yeah. I mean, it's Judah, but again, you know,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   this is why whenever we talk about Israel's history,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   it's confusing because sometimes they say Israel in reference
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   to the Northern Kingdom.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   Sometimes they say Israel in reference
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.580]   to the nation of Israel.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.580]   Sometimes they'll say Israel in reference
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.580]   to the Southern Kingdom, right?
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.580]   So you just have to remember the context
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.580]   because Israel obviously is in reference to the nation of Israel.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.580]   So you just kind of have to understand, like,
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.600]   in that context.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   No, Syria.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   Syria and Ephraim, the Northern Kingdom, got together
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   because Assyria was coming to attack.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   Syria and Assyria are different.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   Two different nations.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   Assyria actually ends up conquering all of them, you know,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.600]   except for the Northern Kingdom, the Southern Kingdom.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   And then later on, Babylonians conquer the Assyrians,
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   and then they end up conquering the Southern Kingdom as well.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   Northern, Southern Kingdom.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   [ Laughter ]
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   Okay.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:24.600]   We'll review it one more time next week,
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   and I'll put some PowerPoints so that, you know,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   at least you have something to kind of cling on to.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   Okay.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   Second section, 714, what would happen as a result
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   of this judgment that God is going to bring?
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   And if you notice, if you go to Chapter 17,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   and the text that we're looking at starting from Verse 7,
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   okay, let's read that.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   It says, "In that day man will look to his Maker,
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   and his eye will lock on the Holy One of Israel.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   and will not look on what his own fingers have made,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   either the ashram or the altars of incense."
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   Now, is he speaking of revival, repentance, or judgment?
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.600]   You understand my question?
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   All right.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   So if you look at it, it says several things are going to happen,
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   that they are going to recognize, finally recognize their Maker, right?
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.600]   They will not be able to put their confidence in false religion, right?
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   And they're not going to be able to put their confidence in his own work,
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   so that what their hands have made.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   Is this because they're repenting and they're returning to the Lord?
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   Not here, right?
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   Here it says the judgment is coming, and whether, you know,
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   like you can come to me because you repent and you want me,
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   but you're going to come to me either way, right?
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   He's saying that his judgment is going to be so harsh,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   they're going to finally recognize him.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   That they refuse to recognize his grace and mercy,
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.600]   but you're going to refuse, now you're going to, you know, see his judgment.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   Either way, you're going to meet the Maker, right?
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   That you're not going to be able to worship idols.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   You're not going to be able to have confidence in the things that you've made,
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   because when the real God shows up, you're going to see, right?
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   So this is in the context of the judgment,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   what's going to result because of the judgment that's coming, right?
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   Why were their efforts, again, in the second section of that,
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.600]   their efforts to sow and harvest become a heap of ruins?
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   And he says, because you have forgotten your Maker,
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   their hard work will amount to nothing.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   And all throughout Scripture, we're told the exact same thing over and over again, right?
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   Unless the Lord builds a house, the builder builds in vain, right?
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   So he said, all that work that you put into building your kingdom,
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   your harvest, your farm, your family,
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.600]   in the end, because you refuse to recognize the Maker, right?
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   All of it is going to be for nothing, right?
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   It's kind of like, you know, you got hired at Google,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   and you're putting in all the work, and in the end,
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.600]   everything that you've done ultimately belongs to Google, right?
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   Because you're not the owner.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   But it's like, you know, you did all of that, and he says,
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.600]   "No, I refuse to recognize Google. I did this work. This is mine."
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.600]   And so he put all that work in, at the end of the day,
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   because he refused to recognize the owner or the Maker,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.600]   all that is going to be for nothing.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   It's going to all be scratched, right?
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   They're not going to get any credit, right?
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   So that's what he's saying, like, because you refuse to acknowledge the Maker,
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   everything that you've done is going to be for nothing.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.600]   Verse 12 and 14, again, specifically, says,
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.600]   "Ah, the thunder of many peoples, they thunder like the thundering of the sea.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   Ah, the roar of nations, they roar like the roaring of mighty waters.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   The nations roar like the roaring of many waters,
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   but He will rebuke them, and they will flee far away,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   chased like the chaff on the mountains before the wind,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   and whirling dust before the storm."
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   So again, when you think about the historical background of this time,
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:10.600]   if, you know, the United States is protected by a body of water on either side,
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   so we don't have enemies on the border that has, you know,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   nuclear bombs, you know, pointing at us,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   and any day that war can break out.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   So you have to remember, these guys are living,
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.600]   these are tiny nations surrounded by superpowers.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.600]   They're surrounded by Egypt, they're surrounded by Assyria,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   the Babylonians, you know, and Persians later on.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   And so this tiny little nation is constantly living in fear
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   that if they don't pay the tribute to the right people,
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   if they don't ally with the, you know, people who are going to come into power,
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   and they're kind of jockeying to see,
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   "Hey, it looks like Babylonians are going to come into power,"
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.600]   so now they're sucking up to the Babylonians.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.600]   You know, it's like, "Oh, it looks like Egypt is going to be the next gun,"
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   then they're sucking up to the Egyptians.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.600]   So basically what God is saying is,
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   all these people that you fear that seem mighty in your eyes,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.600]   when the judgment comes, all of them are going to be nothing, right?
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   Because you're--and that's what the scripture said,
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   if you're going to fear anything, fear one who has authority over life and death, right?
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.600]   So it's natural that feeble human beings are going to fear,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.600]   but your fear should not be of the Assyrians or the Babylonians,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.600]   but the greater fear ought to be the God who created all these people.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   So when the judgment comes, everything that you thought that you were afraid of
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   is going to become nothing inside of God, right?
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   That's what he's saying.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   [inaudible]
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   You mean the judgment?
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   [inaudible]
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   Mankind.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   Right, so if you look at the context of the judgment,
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   obviously, remember we talked about how there is an immediate fulfillment
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   historically against these nations,
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   and then there's a fulfillment that comes at the end times,
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   you know what I mean?
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   And so every prophecy--not every prophecy,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.600]   but most of the prophecies that we see in Isaiah
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.600]   is talking about judgment and restoration,
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.600]   has an ultimate judgment, ultimate restoration.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   So immediate context, obviously, this is talking about--
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   he's in the context of judging Ephraim in Damascus,
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   but at the same time, when the final judgment comes,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   all of this is going to be true of all mankind.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:55.600]   [inaudible]
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   I think for both.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.600]   For both.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.600]   Yeah, I know, like whenever we study--
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   that's the big issue that we have when we're interpreting prophecies,
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   because you have one camp that is going to allegorize everything
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   and say, "Well, this means this, and this means that."
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   We're trying to take it as literally as possible,
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.600]   but again, prophecies, there's allegorical aspect of it,
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.600]   and there is a literal aspect of it,
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   and that's where the difficulty lies.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   That kind of stuff, is that applying to now?
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   Is that applying to later?
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   But again, when we're studying Isaiah,
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   most of what he says has end-time application.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   Right?
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:49.600]   Okay, so the second part in Isaiah 18-7,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   Cush, the city beyond Cush, basically is another word for Ethiopia.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   And what I want to point out about Ethiopia is that Ethiopia's power,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.600]   at least at this particular time, is not as obvious
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   because they're not physically in that area.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   They're beyond Cush, so they have to travel a bit.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.600]   So they were also a mighty power.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   And so what Israel and the smaller nations are doing,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   is kind of jockeying, like, "You know, the Assyrians are coming,
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.600]   and they seem like they're not going to show us any mercy.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   We don't have any mighty countries for us to have allegiance to."
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   So they're reaching out to the Ethiopians who are far away.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.600]   And the reason why I put subtle power beyond Cush
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   is because they're not thundering.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   If you look at the judgment, or if you look at the description of them,
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   we'll talk about it a little bit later.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   The Cushan Ethiopians, the subtle power behind Cush,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   meaning they're not immediately there, they're not threatening anybody,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   but they're a superpower.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   This nation may have tried to build an alliance to get tribute
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   to withstand the superpower of Assyria.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   But basically what the Ethiopians were doing was coming around and saying,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   "If you want us to stay on your side to protect you from the Assyrians
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   and the Babylonians, give us the tribute."
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   And again, these guys are not a threat because they're not their neighbors.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.600]   You have to go travel beyond Cush.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   And what would the Lord do?
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.600]   The Lord waits patiently for the harvest.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   So let's look at that passage.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.600]   Verse 4 and 8.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.600]   It says, "For thus says the Lord said to me,
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   'I will quietly look from my dwelling like clear heat in sunshine,
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   like the cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   For before the harvest, when the blossom is over and the flower becomes
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.600]   ripening grape, he cuts off the shoots from the pruning hooks,
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.600]   and spreading branches, he lops off and clears away.'"
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.600]   You notice how when he talks about the judgment,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   the judgment here is talking about he's not thundering,
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.600]   he's not like mighty warrior.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   He's just kind of like, before the sun rises, before the dew comes,
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   it's going to be very quiet and silent.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   But when the judgment comes, they're going to be wiped out too.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   Their strength is just going to diminish.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   So if you study history during this period of time,
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   Ethiopia is very quiet.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   They weren't like superpower jockeying with Assyria,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   but for that region, they were considered powerful.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   But they're pretty quiet. They're not conquering.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   Because they're a little bit removed by land,
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   they don't have that immediate threat of people coming over,
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   but they were superpower.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   So a lot of these smaller nations were relying, reaching out to them,
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   saying, "If we pay tribute, would you protect us?"
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   And so again, he's bringing judgment upon that,
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   saying, "That's not where you should be paying tribute."
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   So in the end, what does he say?
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.600]   He's going to quietly, wait patiently for the harvest,
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   like the sun or the dew of morning.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   In time, Judah, instead of giving tribute to Ethiopia,
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   Ethiopia will give tribute to the Lord.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   So you don't have faith enough in me to trust in me,
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   and you're going out to Ethiopia.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   But when the time is going to come,
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.600]   that these people that you're relying on are going to come and rely on me.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   These people you fear are going to end up fearing me.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   So against what nation is Chapter 19 a judgment?
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.600]   Okay, let's see, Egypt.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.600]   Okay, and Egypt is one of three superpowers at this time.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:42.600]   The Assyrians, the Babylonians, jockeying for power.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.600]   And how is the Lord depicted as coming in judgment upon this nation?
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   He comes in might and mightiness.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   So when you think about the Assyrian nation,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   he comes in might as with clouds to make idols of Egypt.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   So there's like a thundering,
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   and he's not just kind of quietly causing them to disappear,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   which is fitting of these nations because these nations,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   whenever you study history during this period,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   they're making a lot of noise.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   They're conquering nations.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   Assyrians are--like crucifixion was developed by--
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   started by the Assyrians to scare their enemies, right?
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   And then it was adopted by the Persians, and eventually the Romans took over.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   So just as they were trying to put fear upon the neighboring neighbors,
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   God is going to come in, and he's going to come in thunder, right,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   to show them who's the one that's really powerful.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   In what two forms would judgment come against a nation?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:49.600]   Okay.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   Now I put two forms, but there's more than two.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   They're going to come in civil war.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   It says Egyptians are going to be against the Egyptians.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   In other words, they're going to tear each other apart.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   They will be conquered by a greater power, right?
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   The Syrians are going to conquer them, and eventually the Babylonians
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   are going to conquer all of them.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   The waters, the Nile River that the Egyptians are completely dependent upon,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.600]   God says he's going to bring judgment, and he's going to take that away,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   their confidence.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   So Egyptian economy was directly related to the Nile River.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   So when God says that river is going to be dried up, right,
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   he's going to take--your source of power is going to be taken away.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.600]   And all the leaders and the wisest counselors will become foolish
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   because Egypt was known for their knowledge, for wisdom, right?
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:45.600]   Before the Greeks came, Egypt was kind of like the center of civilization.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   Assyrians were known for their brutality.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   Babylonians were known for their power, right?
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   Egyptians were known for their culture, you know, wisdom.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   And so he says he's attacking each one of these things,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:05.600]   saying these things that you rely on, God's going to bring judgment upon.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   Did you get that?
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   And then finally, how are future blessings described for this
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   and to other nations, right?
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.600]   And so in the midst of all this judgment, remember, he always goes back and forth.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   Even though he brings judgment, his ultimate purpose of judgment
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   is not simply to destroy.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   It's by demonstrating his power to realign your hope, your confidence, your fear.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   All of these things are placed in the wrong place.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   And then so when God's judgment comes, to correct them,
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   to bring them to repentance and to ultimately restore them, right?
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   So he says in that day, their language is going to be united.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   They're going to be speaking the language of the Canaanites, right?
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   And at that time, the Hebrews, Aramaic, Arabic, Syriac, right,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   and other languages are there.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   So what is the significance of language being united?
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   What is the first thing to build a relationship in marriage that you need to have?
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   Communication, right?
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   So Tower of Babel, when they were united, they worked for evil
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   to build themselves up and say, "We're going to be like God."
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.600]   But at the end, when God brings restoration and their love for God is restored,
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   he said the first thing he's going to do is bring them back together, right?
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.600]   So they're going to be speaking the same language.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.600]   In that day, the people will be united in serving the Lord.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   So all these nations that were jockeying and hurting each other
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.600]   and conquering one another, God's going to, again, conquer all of them.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   And those who remain and are repentant are going to be united together.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   Again, even though God has a special place for Israel,
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   his intent is always for the nations, right?
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   When he called the nation of Israel in Genesis 1, 12, he says,
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   "Through them, I'm going to bless all these other nations."
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   So in the end, we see the restoration of all the nations coming back together.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   In that day, more enemies, Egypt and Assyria, will enjoy peace and friendship with one another.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.600]   You know, I talk about Egypt and Assyria, that they're going to be going back and forth,
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   it says in that passage, right?
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:25.600]   That there's going to be business, there's going to be friendship, right?
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   Because there's going to be peace.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   Which offering in the Old Testament illustrates this?
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.600]   One of the major offerings.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   Peace offering.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   Peace offering, right?
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   So you have five major offerings in the Old Testament.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   You have, if we're playing trivia, I'll give you extra points if you do all of them.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   But one of the main offerings, or the five offerings, is peace offering.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   The peace offering was, they would give the offering,
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   and they would only burn the stuff that they couldn't eat.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   And the meaty stuff, they saved, and then they would end up having a picnic on the side.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.600]   So with the priests and with the family members, they would come.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   And what that offering signified is that because we have peace with God, we have peace with each other.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   And it kind of symbolizes, there is no direct connection from that to the communion table,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   but if you understand the significance of the communion table, it's very similar.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.600]   That because we have peace with God, we have union with one another.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   That's basically the communion table.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.600]   And so that's what we see here playing out.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   Because now that they have peace with God, that all this contention, all this war and fighting
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   is going to be done away with, and there's going to be unity and peace.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   So again, the teaching is, every generation, they're looking for peace.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   You have peace signs. Why can't we have peace? Why can't we just all get along?
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   But you can change politics, but until sin is eradicated, there will never be peace.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.600]   And so again, that's what's being illustrated here.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   And finally, "In that day, Israel, Egypt, and Assyria will together be a blessing in the midst of the earth."
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:21.600]   That not only will Israel be blessed, that all the other nations will be a blessing as well,
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   which is what God intended from the beginning.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   [inaudible]
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   Historical, Christological, and then ultimately Second Coming.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   [inaudible]
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   No, historically, I mean, obviously the language, you know,
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:05.600]   well, I mean, I guess you can kind of say they were united in Greek, you know.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   So language-wise, you could say, "Kh," but united in serving the Lord together?
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.600]   I don't know if that ever really happened.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   Maybe, I guess you could milk it. You can say, "The church," kind of, maybe.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   Enjoy peace and friendship? I don't know if that ever happened.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   Together, they were a blessing to the earth? So I don't know if that ever happened.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   So the first two I can kind of see, but last two, no, I don't.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   I can't think of an instance in history where we could say, "Oh, that was the fulfillment."
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   All right, a few of you entered late, so just kind of reiterate.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   Next week, we're having a review.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   So I know that the husband and wives kind of go back and forth.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   If you are able to make it, I encourage you guys, you know,
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   I know it's probably--it might be physically impossible because of the children,
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   but next week, if you feel like you can make it,
