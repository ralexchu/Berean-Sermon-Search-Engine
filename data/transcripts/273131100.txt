[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Romans chapter 14, and I'm going to be reading from verse 5 all the way down to verse 12.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is the second part of the sermon that we started last week about dealing with this
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.680]   very practical issue in the church about division.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.520]   Romans chapter 14, verses 5 through 12.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.400]   And I'm reading out of my ESV Bible.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.680]   Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.640]   The one who observed the day observes it in honor of the Lord.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.280]   The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.080]   For none of us lives to himself and none of us dies to himself.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.060]   For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.800]   So then whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.200]   For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.540]   of the living.
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.800]   Why do you pass judgment on your brother or you?
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.280]   Why do you despise your brother?
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.300]   For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.400]   For it is written, as I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.980]   shall confess to God.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.040]   So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.840]   Let's pray.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.540]   Grace and loving Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.140]   We thank you for the cross.
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.600]   We thank you for the grace, Lord, that causes us to stand.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.520]   Help us, Lord, to lift up our eyes, our thoughts, our mind, our will, all of it, Lord God, to
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.400]   be surrendered to you.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.240]   May your word have its effect this morning.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.640]   Help us to hear the voice of Christ that we may follow him and no other.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.560]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.240]   As you guys know, we're continuing the series in the book of Romans in chapter 14, one through
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.720]   four last week.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.000]   Paul is giving us very practical advice of how to apply love in the church.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.120]   One of the biggest issues that we have in the church, and it's just not just in the
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.240]   modern era, but all throughout church history, is the division that comes into the church.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.000]   What makes the church beautiful is the diversity.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.480]   Different background, different economic status, different culture, that God has placed us
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.240]   all together and he took away the barriers between the Jews and the Gentiles, between
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.880]   nationalities, cultures, economic status, and made us all one family.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.640]   The things that cause division in the society, he took that barrier away and he put us together.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.480]   The glue that binds us together is this love, is the gospel message itself, that we are
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   humbled.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.720]   Whether you are Nicodemus, you are a high person in society, or whether you are a Samaritan
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.640]   woman who is afraid to even go out during the day because of the judgment and the stare
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.480]   from other people, that God equalized where we stand in God's kingdom.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.040]   So the beauty of the church is the diversity, but the very thing that makes the church what
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.380]   it is also can be a source of great problem.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.760]   Because of this diversity, because of the differences, because of our paradigm and the
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.960]   way that we view things, that when the glue of Christ isn't at the center of what we are
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.360]   doing, easily we get divided.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.240]   Because the division already exists in us.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.400]   Division is already existing in our very nature of who we are.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.920]   The people that we like, we're extroverted, introverted, our hobbies.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.720]   We like to sing fast songs, slow songs, we want the lights turned off or on, and we all
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.200]   have different preferences of how we want to live our lives, what we prefer.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.440]   And if we take the glue that brings us together and makes that a side issue, and we begin
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.520]   to highlight our opinions and our thoughts, independent of that, automatically there's
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.660]   division in the church.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.420]   So it wouldn't be an understatement to say that one of the greatest challenges in living
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.120]   the Christian life is staying together, fighting to become one.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.140]   I remember in the early days of going out to China, the very first person that we brought
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.800]   the gospel to became a Christian, and she became our first contact in China.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.760]   And I went during the winter time just to try to follow up with her, with another pastor
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   friend of mine, and we went to China and we were trying to introduce her to a local Bible
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.100]   study.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.640]   And I remember going to that Bible study, and again this is probably what, 1999 or year
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.080]   2000, and I took her to the Bible study, some of you guys may remember, her name was Lucy.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.880]   And right off the bat, I could tell something was off in this Bible study, because the whole
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.520]   Bible study was about why King James is the only version that any Christian should read,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.160]   and that was the whole thing that he spread out.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.560]   So I was hoping like, okay, you know, tolerate this and then we'll move on, because obviously
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.520]   I wasn't using the King James.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.200]   But the whole Bible study was about why King James is the only version that you should
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.840]   study.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.800]   So obviously I was disappointed, it was about an hour and a half of Bible study, and the
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.680]   room was filled with probably about 80% non-Christian, and maybe a couple Christians scattered throughout
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.880]   here and there, and this was a Western missionary from the South who came and was leading this
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.200]   Bible study.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.400]   And if that wasn't bad enough, the end conclusion of this Bible study was, don't trust the other
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   missionaries.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.720]   That was his teaching.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.360]   And then there was a Calvary Chapel missionary that was down the street, there was a Southern
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.120]   Baptist missionary that initially I had some contact with, and he specifically named those
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.000]   people and said, "Don't go to their Bible study because they don't use King James, so
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.240]   they're not teaching you the right thing."
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.280]   And then they prayed and then we separated, right?
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.440]   So as we were walking out, you know, obviously Lucy was confused, and I was trying to introduce
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.520]   her to this Bible study, and the first question that she asked me was, "Why are you Christians
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.320]   so divided?"
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.400]   And obviously, you know, I was trying to give her the right answers, you know, very young
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.760]   Christian, and in the end, there really wasn't any good answer, except that's not what God
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.200]   wants.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.920]   I wish I could tell you that that is unique to my experience in China, but you know as
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.680]   well as I do that that is not the case.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.600]   If you've been a Christian for any period of time, you know how divided the church is.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.960]   There are some things that we can clearly understand why we are divided, and then there
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.280]   are some things that if we, the more we explain it, the more confused we get.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.920]   We divided for that?
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.960]   This is not a challenge just to the new church.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.140]   This was a challenge from the very beginning of the church, because initially, we talked
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.640]   about last week, you had a church filled with people who are former Jews, who lived, and
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.900]   the more faithful they were to obeying the dietary laws and the Sabbath and various New
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.480]   Moon festivals, the more faithful they were to that, they had a harder time transitioning
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.960]   into the new covenant, where the gospel basically said all that was fulfilled in Christ, that
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.560]   we no longer need to abide by these ceremonial laws.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.160]   And so the more faithful Jew they were, the harder time that they had.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.840]   So it naturally caused divisions in the early church.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.320]   Now we talked about last week that Paul clearly identifies with the stronger, meaning that
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.840]   he was the one who was trying to teach them, we need to move beyond that, but he was being
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.980]   very patient, because he understood why this division was taking place.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:37.040]   We already shared that it wasn't a division between a group of people who really loved
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.260]   the Lord and another group of people who were compromising.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.840]   It wasn't a division between idolaters versus people who loved Christ.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.840]   He made it very clear that both groups were loving God.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.440]   Both groups were trying to honor God, and that's oftentimes the hardest thing to deal
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.400]   with in the church, when you have two groups who are doing their best to honor and to love
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:06.280]   God, and yet we are not on the same page, which is common, and it is unavoidable, and
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   it happens in the church.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.740]   So Paul is giving very practical advice on how to deal with something that permeates
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.740]   every single church.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.000]   It is not unique to our church, it is not unique to the first century church, it is
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.480]   not unique to church in China or church in the United States.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.320]   Everywhere where Christians are gathered together, there is this issue of how do we come to become
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.320]   one?
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   How do we fight to become one?
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.680]   So in the text that we're looking at this morning, starting from verse 5 to 12, he gives
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:41.060]   us three principles, three things that I think will highlight and give us very practical
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.680]   advice on how we ought to approach this issue.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.520]   Now let me say right off the bat, before we even jump in, Paul is not saying, he is not
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.280]   saying that you shouldn't have opinions.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.880]   Paul is not saying that you should never fight.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.860]   He is not saying that we should just kind of sweep every difference under the rug and
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.860]   just kind of get along.
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.880]   That is not what he's saying.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.200]   If you know anything about Paul, Paul knows how to draw lines.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.640]   If you remember Galatians, he says if anybody preaches the gospel other than what I preach
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.400]   to you, let it be anathema.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.560]   He had no problem calling out Peter, the leader among the apostles.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.200]   He had no problem calling out Barnabas, who actually stood up for him.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.360]   So Paul is not saying that you shouldn't fight for certain things, that you shouldn't have
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.720]   opinions.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.360]   But in dealing with the conflict that naturally arises in a church that is diverse in opinion,
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.680]   diverse in background, how do we deal with it?
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.760]   What are some fundamental principles that are given to us how we ought to approach all
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.760]   of these things?
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.680]   We're going to deal with the three things that I believe will help us in these principles.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.840]   Number one, we are called first and foremost to judge ourselves.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   We are first called to judge ourselves.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.480]   In verse five it says, "One person esteems one day as better than another, while another
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.220]   esteems all days alike.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:08.000]   Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind."
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.680]   Now if you read that carefully, you should have asked the question, "Isn't this the
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.000]   reason why there was a division in the first place?"
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.440]   Because they all determined in their own mind what they thought was right, but they didn't
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.280]   agree.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.800]   So is Paul just reemphasizing what was causing the problem in the first place?
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.440]   Clearly that can't be what he's talking about, because that was the reason why there
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.720]   was a division in the first place.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.500]   He is not calling that everybody just determine for yourself what is good and just practice
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.980]   that and leave each other alone.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.400]   That is not what he is saying.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.640]   I think it will give us a little bit more clarity if we keep reading in verse six when
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.760]   he says, "The one who observes the day observes it in honor of the Lord.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.160]   The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.640]   While the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God."
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.080]   So what is he talking about in verse five when he says, "Be fully convinced in his own
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.120]   mind"?
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.640]   What he is saying in verse six is that determine for yourself why you are doing what you are
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.360]   doing.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.980]   What is the motive?
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:22.320]   There are two false applications that whenever we try to determine what is righteous and
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:29.440]   what is unrighteous, or what is sinful and not sinful, you have what we call legalism.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:36.920]   And legalists tend to emphasize simply the external, the objective truth.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.120]   This is what righteousness looks like in my life and this is what righteousness should
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.740]   look like in everybody's life.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.020]   So their emphasis is just simply on the objective truth.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:52.400]   And then you have the other end of the spectrum where we could call them licentious or worldly,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.640]   where their determination of what is right and wrong is completely relative.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.040]   It is just internal, subjective.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.320]   And so the way they come to the conclusion is, "Well, it doesn't bother me."
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.160]   Or if they say it is right, who are we to judge them?
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.520]   We should never judge anybody if they seem sincere.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.760]   So right and wrong is simply based upon their sincerity.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.800]   Now either end will get us in trouble because the scripture clearly tells us that whether
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.840]   we are aware of the sin or not, there are things that God will determine sinful even
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.080]   if you had the best motive.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.480]   Paul says that of himself in Acts chapter 23 verse 1.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.200]   As he is standing before the Sanhedrin, he describes his life as a Jew like this.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.680]   Looking intently at the council, Paul said, "Brothers, I have lived my life before God
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.720]   in all good conscience up to this day."
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:50.120]   Paul described his life to be righteous in his own mind, in clear conscience.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.060]   Now the Jews when they heard this got angry because they disagreed with him.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.720]   Because if you truly lived righteously, you wouldn't be proclaiming Christ.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.640]   So they couldn't understand that.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   Because the Pharisees, this is exactly how they were living.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   They were trying their best to objectively, these are the things that a good Jew does,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.920]   and if you did it, you are righteous.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.560]   Do you remember that encounter that Jesus has with the Samaritan woman in John chapter
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.560]   4?
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.880]   Where they're going back and forth and Jesus reveals himself to be the Messiah and the
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.540]   Samaritan woman basically says, "You guys worship in that mountain or in this mountain."
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.460]   And she was basically thrown out of the smoke screen, identifying the difference between
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.980]   the Jews and the Samaritans.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.460]   And Jesus says to her in that context, "If you want to know the truth, the Jews have
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.180]   the truth.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.980]   They have the truth.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.900]   And if you want to simply determine righteousness by truth, you guys are wrong.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.260]   The Samaritans are the ones who compromised and went astray.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.260]   They have the truth.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.320]   They have the Old Testament.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:14:01.380]   But what God is looking for is not simply truth, but spirit and truth."
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:08.540]   Meaning righteousness, and right and wrong, isn't simply determined by objective truth,
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.320]   but also subjective, meaning your motive matters.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.500]   Why you do something is just as important as what you're doing.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.620]   That's exactly what the problem with what the Pharisees were.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.940]   They complied to the objective truth better than anybody else.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.020]   In fact, they added on top of that.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:32.500]   They wanted to make sure that they kept the law so perfectly that God wouldn't be able
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.620]   to hold any grudge against them.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.860]   And yet when Christ showed up, he pointed out their sin left and right.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.460]   Remember what he called them?
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.740]   Whitewashed tombs.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:48.300]   You're doing all of these things objectively, but internally, it's nothing more than a
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.980]   tomb.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:59.060]   So what Paul is highlighting here is first and foremost to examine ourselves.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.580]   Examine to see our motive.
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.460]   Examine to see who we are, where we stand.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:12.020]   Because you can come to church all your life and do the right thing, say the right things,
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:17.380]   give the right things, and be dead wrong in the presence of God.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.400]   You can be a missionary.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.700]   You can be a preacher of the gospel.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.900]   You can serve in Sunday school.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:30.660]   You can be the biggest donor in the church and be dead wrong in the presence of God.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.140]   He's saying first and foremost, if you want to determine what is right and wrong, first
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.460]   determine in your own mind.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.360]   In other words, examine yourself carefully.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.620]   Because there is objective truth, but there is also subjective truth as your motive.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.740]   In James chapter 4, verse 17, it says, "So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:51.020]   to do it, for him it is sin."
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.220]   Because of the knowledge that he has.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.860]   First Corinthians 8, 9-13.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.340]   But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.700]   weak.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:05.700]   For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.340]   encouraged if his conscience is weak to eat food offered to idols?
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.420]   And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:17.900]   The brother for whom Christ died, thus sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.900]   when it is weak.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.100]   You sin against Christ.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.380]   Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat lest I make my brother
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.380]   stumble.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:31.860]   The apostle Paul describes what is sinful in the context of a weak brother.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:37.620]   He's not simply saying, he believes that if you embrace the new covenant that these things
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.620]   don't matter.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.340]   Paul made it very clear where he stood.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.340]   But he's not determining sin and righteousness simply objectively.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:51.460]   He's determining in his own heart in that context the motive behind what he is doing
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.140]   makes it sinful.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.540]   And that's exactly what he is saying here first and foremost.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.540]   Determine in your own heart.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.900]   Determine in your own heart your motive or why you're doing what you're doing.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:09.520]   Remember in Acts chapter 16 when apostle Paul first picks up Timothy to be his disciple?
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.400]   The very first thing that Paul does with Timothy, do you remember?
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.060]   He circumcises him.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:20.180]   And then yet when we get to Galatians chapter 2 verse 3, Paul boasts that he didn't circumcise
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.040]   Titus.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.540]   So if you read the scriptures carefully, you may look at that on the surface and say, Paul
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.900]   contradicted himself.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.420]   One, he circumcised and then the other he boasts that he didn't circumcise.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.660]   So did Paul change his mind?
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.660]   And there's this new theology.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.260]   I mean, it's been going around for a while where Paul's theology changed in time.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.940]   And they'll interpret this as like, well, he didn't know earlier on, but later on in
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.900]   his ministry he realized he was wrong and so he changed his mind.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:52.020]   Obviously, that is not a biblical right theology.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:58.140]   Paul circumcised Timothy because every city he went, he was preaching the gospel in the
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.000]   synagogues.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.740]   So as a young Jew who wasn't circumcised, he wouldn't have been able to get into the
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.740]   synagogue.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.940]   But for the purpose of preaching the gospel, he had Timothy circumcised.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.620]   Titus was a Gentile.
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:18.300]   So to circumcise Titus at what he was doing with Titus, it would have confused the gospel.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.500]   One he circumcises, the other one he doesn't circumcise, all for the same purpose of preaching
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.640]   the gospel.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.100]   So we see that pattern in Paul's life.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:33.100]   And that's why it says in Hebrews chapter 4, 12, the word of God judges the thoughts
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.340]   and intentions of what?
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.980]   Of our heart.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:44.100]   If we study the scriptures simply to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong, at the end
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.500]   of the day, all we become are Pharisees who are good at pointing out what other people
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.660]   are doing wrong.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:57.180]   He says the goal of Bible study ultimately is to know God and that by knowing God, that
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.580]   God in his word would judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.660]   As for our own sanctification.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:09.160]   But when we approach the word of God as simply objective truth and we pile up all this theology
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.780]   that we're filled in our heads of knowledge, then we become experts in pointing out what
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.040]   other people are doing wrong.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.980]   But the point of the Bible study is to judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.480]   And that's exactly what Paul is calling us to in this text.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.900]   First and foremost, as we are wrestling with this difference of opinion to focus our attention
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.540]   and judge the thoughts and intentions of our own heart first.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:38.780]   Secondly, we are called to establish Christ as Lord in all things.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:44.660]   Are the reasons why we are wrestling and struggling ultimately about his glory?
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.100]   He says, do whatever you do, do it in the honor of the Lord.
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:53.500]   In verse 7 it says, "For none of us lives to himself and none of us dies to himself."
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.260]   If we live, we live to the Lord and if we die, we die to the Lord.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.320]   So then whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.740]   For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   of the living.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.940]   Let me stop right there before I even read verse 11.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:15.420]   You notice how he doesn't simply say that he died and we ought to establish Christ.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.700]   He says, to this end Christ died and lived again.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.700]   To this end.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.380]   What does that mean?
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:30.680]   The purpose of his death and resurrection is to establish Christ as Lord.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.660]   So much of our Christian life is frustrated because fundamentally we get that wrong.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.100]   That we think that Christ delivered us from this bondage of sin so that now we can enjoy
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.580]   life.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:48.620]   Superficially, fundamentally, that is correct but it is incomplete.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:56.660]   What was lost at the fall, the main core of human rebellion is to reject him as Lord.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.940]   That's what Adam and Eve did when God clearly told them not to do this.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.720]   He said, "No, we want to be like God.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.820]   We want to be where he is.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.500]   We want to know what he knows."
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:10.900]   And so they rejected his commandment and decided to live by what they thought was right.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.700]   And it was something simple as eating a fruit.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.060]   It wasn't rape.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.900]   It wasn't murder.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:24.980]   It was a simple, deliberate, willful rebellion against God's Lordship in their life.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:33.180]   So if redemption is to restore what was lost, what was lost is Lordship of God.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:40.880]   So Paul says here, the whole point of the Gospel, the whole point of our gathering,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.360]   the whole point of Bible study, the whole point of evangelism, our fellowship, everything
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.520]   that we do is for the purpose, for this end, it says, he died.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.060]   To establish him as Lord.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.320]   So our ultimate goal, our ultimate end is not your family.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.260]   It's not so that you can have a safe place to raise your kids.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.260]   That is not the goal.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.100]   It is not a place where we can share our lives and comfort each other.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:13.620]   These are all byproducts, great things to have, but the end goal of everything that
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:19.300]   God is doing to establish God as Lord.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.140]   Both of the dead and the living.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.140]   Of the dead and the living.
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.100]   You know what that means?
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:31.860]   Sometimes God will end somebody's life for his glory.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.860]   Sometimes we will live a long life for his glory.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.900]   Sometimes you will live a healthy life for his glory.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.000]   Sometimes you will be sick for his glory.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.280]   Sometimes you will have a great job and pay your bills for his glory.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.960]   Sometimes you will struggle and have a difficult time for his glory.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.720]   Because the end goal is not you.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.440]   The end goal with our conflict, the end goal of why we need to be united is not you, it's
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.920]   not me, it's not Breon.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.120]   It's for his glory.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.120]   It's for his Lordship.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.640]   It is not about having money or not having money.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.680]   You can eat and give glory to God and you cannot eat and give glory to God.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:20.800]   I know plenty of people who have a lot of money who are righteous people.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.880]   And I know people who are very poor in honoring and loving God.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.760]   I know people in the Presbyterian church that I look up to.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.880]   I know people in the Charismatic group that I look up to.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.900]   I don't agree with all their theology, but they give God the glory.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.360]   And he says the end product is for that.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:46.480]   In Mark chapter 2, 27-28, Jesus was constantly being accused of breaking the Sabbath.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:53.160]   But Jesus turns the table on them and he says, in verse 27, he says, "The Sabbath was made
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.320]   for man and not man for Sabbath.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.560]   So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.000]   In other words, he says the whole point of the Sabbath was given to man so that you would
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.080]   rest.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.840]   But there was nothing that burdened a Jew more than the Sabbath.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:16.720]   And the irony of the conflict was the word Sabbath basically meant rest.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:22.320]   There was probably nothing more that brought burden upon a Jew than the Sabbath because
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.000]   they created all of these laws that they needed to follow and they were examining everybody
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.840]   to see how many steps you took on Sunday.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.440]   What kind of food you ate?
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.800]   Did you milk the cow or did you not milk the cow?
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.840]   Did you turn on the light or did you not turn on the light?
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.760]   Did you touch the fire or not turn on the fire?
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   I mean, they made the Sabbath into the hardest day of all the other days.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:51.200]   So Jesus turns the table around and said, first of all, Sabbath means rest.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.840]   You're missing the whole point.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.560]   The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.440]   But the ultimate end wasn't even that.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.480]   He says further on, he says, "But the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath."
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.440]   What was the purpose of this rest?
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.560]   It was for God.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.840]   God created creation in six days.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.480]   On the seventh day, he entered rest.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.960]   And on the seventh day, he told man to glorify God.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.280]   He was made in the image of God to reflect his glory.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.040]   And when the Sabbath was broken, what does the scripture say?
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.760]   All have sinned and fall short of what?
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.360]   His glory.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.100]   That's what was broken on the Sabbath.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:34.760]   So the point of the Sabbath is to bring glory back to God.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   And that's what he is saying.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:42.560]   So ultimately, the reason why we need to work toward unity is for his glory.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.360]   Not because of the Beroean Community Church, not because of my family, not because of my
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.200]   ego, but for his glory.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   Is this what we seek?
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.400]   Philippians 2, 9-11, it says, "Therefore God has highly exalted and bestowed on him the
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.680]   name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.880]   heaven and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, through
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.320]   the glory of God the Father."
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:12.120]   The text that I just read to you is a portion of the earliest hymn that we know of the church.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.720]   You know, kind of like some churches practice Apostles' Creed or we have the Lord's Prayer.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.940]   They believe, the church fathers believe, the church historians believe that that was
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.280]   a hymn that the early church recited back toward one another.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.200]   So it was kind of like their first Apostles' Creed that stated the most core doctrines
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   that they wanted every church to know.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.440]   And I just read to you the end portion of it, which was exaltation of God.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.660]   That every knee should bow, every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.400]   But the beginning of this hymn starts with Paul telling the church, "Do not consider
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.760]   yourself better than anybody else, consider others better than yourself."
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.160]   And then he says, "Have the mind of Christ, who emptied himself, became nothing, humbled
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:59.000]   himself, took on the form of man, even to the point of being hung on the cross."
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.160]   So the path of his glory was his humiliation.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.780]   To bring glory to God, he humbled himself.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:14.000]   And so what Paul, in this passage and every other passage that he teaches us about love,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.800]   is to bring the greatest glory to God, the path to do that is to humble yourself before
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.280]   man.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:31.920]   So examine ourselves, bring God the glory, ultimately, and again, those are the two principles
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   that he teaches.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:39.720]   Let me give you a practical illustration of this in my life.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.240]   I know many of you guys know Francis Chan.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.460]   Some of you guys may like him, some of you guys may not, I don't know.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.920]   But I enjoy listening to Francis Chan.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:53.280]   There was a period when I listened to him pretty regularly, because, not necessarily
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.960]   because of the exposition, but he's a passionate guy and I know that he practices what he preaches.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:05.880]   But I love his preaching, I love his passion, I love his examples, but one thing just really
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.520]   never sat well with me.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.040]   If you watch his videos, he's always wearing a slipper when he preaches.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.880]   He wears a slipper.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.480]   So first time I watched it, I was like, "Oh, maybe there's a baptism going on today."
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   And so that's why he wore his slippers.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.720]   And sure enough, every week I'm watching, he's wearing slippers.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.680]   And then sometimes he has ripped jeans, and sometimes, he's wearing very casual clothes.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.200]   So I never knew why he was doing that, it just didn't sit well with me.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.480]   So I love his preaching, if he would just change his shoes, it would be so much better
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.680]   for me.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.920]   So I actually looked it up to see why does he wear slippers, of all things, I mean, maybe
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.920]   even tennis shoes I can tolerate, okay, but slippers?
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.560]   So I actually looked it up and there's a video of him explaining why he wears slippers on
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.560]   Sunday.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:29:01.900]   So his explanation was that he wants his church to not be a Sunday Christian.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.280]   So he wants them to be consistent Monday through Sunday.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.920]   He doesn't want people to kind of dress up for Sunday and pretend to be somebody that
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.680]   they're not.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.680]   So because he wears slippers throughout the week, he wants to come up on the pulpit and
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.280]   to teach his congregation that I want you to love the Lord all week long, Monday through
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.060]   Sunday.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:29.620]   And that's why he dresses the way he does, because he wants every day to be consistent.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.320]   I did not agree with that.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.900]   But I understood his heart.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.360]   I understood why he was in it, and I respected him for it.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   It still bothers me.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:46.320]   One day I'm going to write a letter to him, "Please change your shoes."
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.200]   I know you don't know who I am, but it would help the kingdom if you just wore regular
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   shoes.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.000]   That's just my opinion.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.240]   I'm of the opinion exactly the opposite.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.440]   I think Sunday worship, corporate worship, is set apart.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.800]   That we ought to be consistent Monday through Saturday, but Sunday corporate worship is
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.440]   not like any other day.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.680]   Corporate worship where the gathering of believers are together ought to be set apart and we
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.320]   should, there should be extra sacredness of the gathering of believers, of the community.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.960]   There are certain things that are considered more sacred, just like the Holy of Holies
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.040]   were more sacred than the outer court, and then the outer court outside of the wall,
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.280]   all of these have different levels of sacredness.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.120]   This is what I believe.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.120]   Francis Chan doesn't believe it.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:34.000]   But I respect him, and I understand why he's doing what he is doing, so that helps me.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.600]   But that is not something that I need to fight for.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.680]   I'm not going to stand here and say, "No slippers.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.940]   You must wear a tie.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.940]   You must do this.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:50.960]   You must do that," because that's simply my opinion, and this is my preference.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.840]   And so the Scripture says, "Ultimately, he's trying to establish Christ as Lord, and I'm
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.400]   trying to establish Christ as Lord in our church, and it just doesn't look the same."
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.000]   So again, Apostle Paul is saying, "Ultimately, make sure that he is glorified."
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.200]   Third and finally, we are called to remember that God is the ultimate judge.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.720]   God is the ultimate judge, not us.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.360]   In Romans 4, 14, 10 through 12, "Why do you pass judgment on your brothers, or you, why
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.320]   do you despise your brother?
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.760]   For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.040]   So then each of us will give an account of himself."
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.280]   What does it mean for Christians to be judged?
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.080]   He says, "Don't judge because God's going to judgment."
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   So what does that mean?
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.800]   Because in John 5, 24, it says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.160]   in him who sent me has eternal life.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.840]   He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life."
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:50.080]   He clearly says, "Salvation means that we are not under judgment."
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.720]   And yet, here it says, "Don't judge because God will judge."
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:32:00.180]   Romans 8, 1, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.360]   So are we misunderstanding here when he says, "There is no condemnation, there is no judgment,"
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.760]   and yet he says, "Do not judge because God is going to ultimately judge."
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.160]   What does he mean by that?
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.200]   I think the clear teaching is in 1 Corinthians 3, 12 through 15.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.440]   You can look it up or you can look behind me.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   Before I even read this text, I spent probably about eight to nine months with two supposed
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.360]   missionaries from the local church.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.040]   When I say local church, I'm talking about the Witness Lee group.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.560]   It's a cult group that gathers together in each local area and they call it the local
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.920]   church.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.560]   Their whole premise of their church is based upon this text.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.480]   And then obviously all their proof texts, but this text.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.320]   We spent eight, nine months dissecting over the meaning of this text.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.840]   The reason why I'm sharing this with you, because if you are a UCI student, or if you're
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:07.480]   from UCI or ever been on UCI, they have 17 full-time missionaries just stationed at UCI.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.160]   They'll never identify themselves, they'll just say, "We're just a Christian group,"
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.400]   and they invite people to their Bible study.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:17.000]   Then eventually as they do Bible study, this stuff begins to come out.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.440]   Now before I explain this text, the context of this text.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:28.400]   Paul began 1 Corinthians because he's concerned over the division in the church.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.360]   Some were judging that Peter had the truth.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.800]   Some were judging that Paul did.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.680]   Some were judging and saying that maybe Apollos is the one that we ought to follow.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   And each one of them had their own strength.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.800]   Apostle Paul was the one who was bringing the gospel literally to the world, to the
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.240]   Gentile world.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.680]   So his fame was spreading like crazy.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.820]   This guy was a guy who was persecuting and killing Christians, and all of a sudden now
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.880]   he's propagating the same gospel that he was trying to squash.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.040]   Clearly we know why they were going for Peter, because he was a leader among all the apostles.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.760]   He was a leader among leaders, so clearly he ought to be the one in charge.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.560]   He's the one that we ought to follow.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.440]   Apollos is probably the most gifted.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.180]   He knew his theology from the Old Testament, even before he met Christ.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.720]   He was teaching the right doctrine of what the Messiah looks like, and all he had to
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.360]   do was to be shown that that Messiah he was preaching actually showed up.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:30.240]   So the reputation was that Apollos was the gifted one, and Paul was the passionate one.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.640]   He had all this energy.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.640]   And then Peter was the leader among leaders.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:41.640]   So there were clearly reasons why any one of these three men would have been venerated
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.640]   by the church.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:48.000]   But Paul is addressing this issue, why the church is divided and all separated.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.400]   This was causing all kinds of trouble in the church.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.920]   And so it is in that context, because they were saying, "You shouldn't follow him, we
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.800]   should follow him."
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.560]   Have that mind, that's the context that he's writing this.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.480]   And he says, "Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones,
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:10.680]   wood, hay, or straw, each one's work will become manifest, for the day will disclose
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.680]   it."
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   Now stop right there.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.820]   When he says, "Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold," now what's the foundation
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.280]   he's talking about?
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.880]   He's talking about spreading the gospel, right?
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   Who spread the gospel in Corinth?
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:31.920]   No, no, I just want you to think, I'm not actually expecting an answer.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.040]   Paul did, right?
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.800]   Paul spent probably the second most time in this city preaching the gospel than the first
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.600]   place that he spent most time is in Ephesus, and the second is Corinth.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.200]   So Paul was the one who spread the gospel, right?
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.340]   So he is the one who laid the foundation, and then Apollos and Peter may have showed
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:52.260]   up later, and they were encouraging the church and feeding and teaching.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:58.700]   He says, "Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood,
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:03.460]   hay, or straw, each one's work will become manifest, for the day will disclose it."
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.900]   What work is he talking about?
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.300]   Work of Paul, Peter, and Apollos, right?
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.180]   Because it will be revealed by fire, the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.780]   Which work is he talking about?
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:19.820]   Peter, Paul, and Apollos, because that's what they were divided over, right?
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.820]   Whose work should we venerate?
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.100]   Who should we follow?
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.700]   Who's the one who should lead?
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.460]   He said in the end, what is he saying?
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.940]   God's going to judge that.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.380]   If there's any judgment to be made, he said God's going to judge that, because it will
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.940]   be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:42.220]   If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.780]   So what judgment is he referring to?
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:51.180]   He's not talking about judgment of condemnation, or judgment of punishment for your sins.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:57.180]   He's talking about reward for the laboring for the gospel.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.420]   He said if there's any judgment to be made, and any reward to be passed out, God will
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.980]   test their work, and God is the one who will reward them.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:09.100]   And if anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved,
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.700]   but only as through fire.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.980]   In other words, if even everything that he has done is nullified, he will still be saved.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.260]   He's not talking about condemnation.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.700]   He's talking about reward.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.660]   Reward.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.380]   So what is Paul saying, that God will ultimately be the judge?
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.900]   He's not saying to Christians that if you don't behave and you get it wrong, you're
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.540]   going to be condemned and go to purgatory to pay for your sins.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.660]   That's not what he is saying.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:37.260]   He's saying if there's any judgment to be made, God is the only one who will really
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.620]   know his motive.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.180]   God is the one who's going to determine if that was ultimately done for God's glory.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:49.180]   And God is going to be the one who's going to determine by fire, testing of their work,
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:56.220]   whether it's foundation laying, whether it is building or feeding, whatever it is, leave
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:56.940]   that to God.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.260]   That's basically what he is saying.
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:05.260]   The conclusion of everything that Paul is saying, Paul himself actually applies what
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:11.180]   he is saying here in Romans chapter 14, the text that we read, and we see that clearly
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.020]   in 1 Corinthians 4, 3 to 6.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.220]   And I'm going to conclude with this.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:21.900]   1 Corinthians 4, 3 to 6, Paul actually practices what he tells the Roman church to do.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:28.460]   But with me, it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.020]   court.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.420]   In fact, I do not even judge myself.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.860]   I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.820]   So let me stop right there.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:42.220]   Paul says he lives with a clear conscience that everything that he does, as far as he
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.860]   knows, he's aware of, he's doing the right thing.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.220]   But that does not acquit him.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:51.180]   In other words, he could just be not aware of it.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.260]   Exactly what he says, examine yourself first.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.900]   Because the Lord is the one who will judge me.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:02.380]   Do not pronounce judgment before time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.660]   things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purpose of the heart.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.780]   Your heart motive of why.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:15.420]   God is going to come and he was going to discern if what we are doing is ultimately really
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.420]   for God or if it is not.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:23.660]   Then each one will receive his commendation, not condemnation, but commendation from God.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.140]   He's not talking about judgment, but reward.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:32.780]   I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.300]   So take a step back.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:39.340]   So again, the larger context of everything he's talking about is because they were judging.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.140]   Should we follow Paul, Apollos or Peter?
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:48.380]   And so he's applying all of these things for your benefit that you may learn by us.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.180]   And here's the key.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:56.700]   Not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.180]   another.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.900]   To not to go beyond what is written.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:09.980]   The only authority that I have in this church is the authority behind the word of God.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.100]   I can tell you I live longer.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.540]   I can tell you that I've served this and I've done this and I've done that.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.740]   But you can probably cite 10 other people that are older than I am, has experienced
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.060]   more than I have and know more of the Bible than I do.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.420]   So by that, my opinion is nullified.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.780]   The only authority that I have up on this pulpit is, is it biblical?
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.620]   Am I reciting what the Bible says?
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:37.420]   And that's why he says, do not go beyond what is written.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:42.620]   Anything that goes beyond what is written, he may be puffed up in favor of one against
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.120]   another.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:49.180]   Root of the problem is going beyond what is written.
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.300]   The end conclusion of all of this.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:57.100]   Now I could sit here, you know, this is probably one of those texts that if I was preaching
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.180]   topically, I would probably never preach.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.380]   Right?
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.260]   Because I know what sermons are better received.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:07.740]   You know, I can talk about the deep, deep love of Christ, right?
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.380]   Which is what Romans, a lot of Romans is.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.660]   And we did talk a lot about that.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:16.380]   We can talk about the unending grace of Christ, how he does not delight in the punishment
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.020]   of the wicked.
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.420]   You know, what heaven is going to look like.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:24.940]   I can fill the preaching calendar until the day I die with things that, that, that will
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.300]   get a good response.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.580]   This is not one of those texts.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:33.980]   You know, like how to determine whether you should eat or not eat, which is Sabbath, Saturday
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.620]   or Sunday.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.660]   But this is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.540]   We can talk about the love of Christ and how we ought to be united, but when we actually
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.340]   begin to practice these things, we have all kinds of issues.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:53.180]   And the struggle that we have in practicing this love is that it looks good in theory,
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.020]   but very difficult to practice.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.980]   And that's why I think the Bible is so practical.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:05.260]   Because Paul was dealing with the same problem in the early church that they did in every
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.540]   other part of church history.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:15.260]   And the wisdom behind everything, the end conclusion of all of this in the end, is that
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.820]   what keeps us together is the love of Christ.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:22.380]   To love as Christ loved.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:32.940]   And as simple and as fundamental to our Christian faith as that is, it is very difficult to
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:38.780]   practice because it goes against our nature to rebel.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:43.180]   It goes against our nature to live.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:51.580]   It goes against our nature to be somebody, to be recognized, to be better than our neighbor,
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:57.500]   to succeed, to get an A, to move ahead, to get promoted, to move to a better house, to
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.460]   better our neighborhood.
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:04.220]   It flies against, the love of Christ flies against our rebellious nature to establish
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.660]   Christ as Lord and not me.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:11.180]   So we can talk about the love of Christ in a flowery way where everybody is encouraged,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:18.300]   but the day-to-day grind of practicing this requires a commitment to the church.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:22.140]   It is not strange that we have different opinions.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.340]   It is not strange that there is conflict.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.580]   In fact, what is strange is that the church is on divide already.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:36.940]   Considering how diverse we are, considering how different opinions that we have, what
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.700]   binds us together is the love of Christ.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:47.580]   And what causes us to persevere is the commitment to practice this love, no matter how difficult,
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:57.500]   no matter how hard, no matter how humbling, that our goal in this church is to exalt Christ.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:03.820]   At the communion table this morning, we come together and nothing exemplifies that more
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:04.860]   than the communion table.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.620]   Because the communion table brings us all low.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:14.300]   Whatever pride that we had before we came in and whatever lowliness and guilt that we
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.140]   felt before we came in, he brings us all to the communion table by his grace.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.340]   He told us to do this in remembrance of him.
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:25.340]   Not of you, not of me, not of some good example, but of him.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.300]   That Christ was crucified because of our sins.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:36.140]   And so he brings us to this table to unite us, to put aside the differences and to fix
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:39.260]   our eyes upon Christ, the author and the perfect of our faith.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:46.300]   So this morning, as we open up the communion table, we're going to ask you guys again to
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.380]   come from the outside and go down the middle so that we don't create traffic in here.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.500]   The communion table is for the Christians.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.660]   So it's for us to celebrate our union with Christ.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.660]   And so if you've never experienced that, you've never confessed your sins to the Lord
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.580]   and established him as Lord in your life, and we ask that you would just remain seated.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.500]   And if you have further questions about the meaning behind all of this, we're more than
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.540]   willing to sit and talk with you.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.340]   Just let us know.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:18.140]   And for those of you guys who are coming, come meaningfully, not with any righteousness.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.820]   Again, you may have come this morning and said, "You know what?
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.260]   I don't know if I should participate in communion because I just was not good.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.740]   I struggled with purity this week.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.420]   I struggled with anger.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.500]   I struggled with coveting."
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:33.900]   That's what the communion table is ultimately for, is to remind us that the solution is
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.140]   not willpower, but Christ's love.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:41.420]   And so we want to encourage you to take some time to contemplate and think and to repent.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.860]   And to come to celebrate together as we open up the communion table.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:49.820]   So let me read 1 Corinthians 11, 25, and a few verses down.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.300]   And then Pastor Nate's going to come and he's going to help me with the communion table
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:52.860]   this morning.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:58.060]   "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.980]   night when he was betrayed took bread.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:04.540]   When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.060]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:11.180]   In the same way, also he took the cup after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:11.820]   in my blood.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.420]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.'"
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.260]   So let me pray for us and then our worship team is going to come and lead us.
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.220]   And then as you are ready, we ask that you would come one by one.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:30.700]   Gracious and loving Father, you know the depth of our sins.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:35.020]   Things that we are aware of and things that we are blind to.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.460]   Lord, we desire to honor you.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.660]   Search us and know us and see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:48.140]   I pray for my brothers, Lord God, who are struggling in their conscience, Lord.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:55.820]   Because they truly desire to honor you and yet they feel like they're failing over and
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.320]   over.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.100]   Strengthen them today in this communion table.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.420]   Remind them, Lord God, there is hope in the name of Jesus.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:06.620]   Remind them, Lord God, that we have the Holy Spirit groaning on our behalf, Lord God,
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.220]   interceding for our weaknesses.
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.700]   I pray for those who are living with clear conscience.
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.620]   Laboring day to day, Lord God, to honor God.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:24.860]   But even in them, Father, remind us, remind them that if it wasn't for your grace, we
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.500]   wouldn't be here.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.700]   If it wasn't for your mercy, Lord God, that we would not be able to worship you.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.260]   So I pray that as we participate in this communion table, make us one.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:42.060]   Help us to fight to be one, Lord God, to honor and glorify you.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.860]   May this communion table sanctify your church.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.740]   Amen.
