[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620]   Alright, so hopefully you guys had some time to look through these passages and I'm sure
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.960]   you've noticed there's a lot of similarities to the sin offering.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:22.640]   We talked about how, what the sin offering meant last week and one of the key factors
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.680]   of the sin offering is to detail how God views sin and that not all sins were treated equally.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.880]   So we had the sin of the high priest, the sin of the community, sin of a leader or sin
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.320]   of a regular congregation member and how the offering in each one of them were different
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.080]   and there was a distinction between an intentional and an unintentional.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.880]   And intentional we looked at last week where it was a willful rebellion against God.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.720]   Even something as small as breaking the Sabbath in our view may not seem like a big deal but
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.320]   in God's view it was very clearly stated how important Sabbath was and for someone to break
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.120]   that was basically a willful rebellion against God.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.160]   And so sin offering kind of revealed all of that, it went through the intricate details.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.960]   This week's offering, the guilt offering, again in many ways it is very similar.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.640]   It's going to give us another aspect and detail of how God views sin and how again the penalty
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.920]   of sin and how God in their repentance would restore whatever it was that was broken.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:38.920]   So as we jump right into it, guilt offering in other places or oftentimes it would be
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.080]   called trespass offering or reparation offering and so there's about four or five different
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.120]   names and all of them basically means the same thing.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.760]   It is a different aspect of the sin offering but it specifically deals with trespass, when
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.560]   something was done against something or someone, that this was not a private sin, this was
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.040]   not a sin simply your rebellion against God but it affected other people, other people's
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.360]   property or something that you've done and so that's why it's called a trespass offering,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.880]   you trespass against somebody else or a reparation offering because it required a reparation,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.000]   a pay of whatever it was that was broken.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.560]   A ram or male lamb without defect was the exclusive animals required for this offering.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.680]   All other offerings had different options for the type of animals used but this offering
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.040]   was limited to these two particular animals, at least that's what we see.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.440]   Why do you think that's the case?
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.000]   If you had some time to look through these passages and you try to understand what he
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.920]   required in this offering, why do you think that God didn't give them any options?
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.880]   Think about the intention of this offering.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.680]   You don't have to say anything, I just want you to think about it.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.080]   You know maybe some of you guys already asked that question before you came.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.000]   Why in every other offering God gave different offerings that they could give, right, to
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.240]   give this one or that one and based upon you know your wealth and what you couldn't or
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.400]   could or couldn't afford, you know, male lamb or female lamb but this one is very specific,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:35.680]   it was just this animal and that was it.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.680]   It doesn't spell out why but we can understand why God wouldn't give them all these options
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.480]   because the point of this offering wasn't the lamb itself.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.120]   The point of this offering was reparation, is to pay back.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.440]   You understand?
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.400]   So the goal of this offering was to repay back whatever it was that you defiled, whatever
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.500]   you did against somebody else and to add on top of that.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.440]   So even though the offering was given, the main point of this was reparation.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.200]   So that's probably the main reason why there wasn't all these different alternatives in
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.400]   giving the offering.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.960]   There was a specific monetary compensation involved in this offering for the restitution
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.800]   of damage committed by the sinner.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.520]   And just to kind of give you, again I want to go over this, after making the guilt offering
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.760]   with the ram or lamb, it was required from the offender to add a fifth of the value to
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.360]   give to the priest first.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.240]   So that's why, again, the idea is trespassing, reparation, and to pay back whatever it was
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.160]   that you defiled and then on top of that, add 20%.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.200]   And the reason why it's 20%, at that particular time, 20% was a typical interest rate on all
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   loans.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.640]   So there was, today, you know, we have different interest rates, like we have home loans, right
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.960]   now I think it's about 4.3, so if you happen to live in California, that's about what you
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.840]   would pay, everybody would pay.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.640]   Car loans are different, you know, student loans are different, but at that particular
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.800]   time it was well understood that if you gave a loan to somebody, that you would, they would
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.480]   have an understanding that 20% would be given back.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.640]   So this 20% basically represented that whatever it was that you took, that you were kind of
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.540]   giving back with interest, right?
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.940]   Almost as if you took it for a loan and then you're paying them back.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:38.800]   So this offering is unique in that there was, there's no other animals that was, choices
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.120]   that was given, it was specifically those particular animals and there was a compensation
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.120]   involved.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.240]   There was actually money being exchanged in this offering.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.760]   So like all the other offerings, you would bring the animal to the priest and they would
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.960]   see if it was acceptable, then after they received that it was acceptable, the priest
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.760]   would take it and then the restitution would be made to the offended party.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.040]   It's not spelled out here, but numbers 5, 5 through 10, it says if the offended party
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.480]   wasn't available to receive the property or money, the nearest relative who was available
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.680]   was paid instead.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.360]   So these are some of the unique qualities of this particular offering.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.520]   So some of it is very similar to the sin offering, right?
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.780]   And then there's like two or three things that are very unique to them, but the most
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:38.400]   unique part of this particular offering was the compensation, right?
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.600]   And so what this offering, and we're going to talk about this later, what this offering
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:49.480]   basically taught was that when your sin caused damage to someone else's property, God required
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.720]   that not only that you come before God and say, "Oh, I'm sorry," and then, "Well,
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.760]   me and God, we're okay," but it was required to pay back, right?
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.660]   To pay reparation and restore whatever damage that you've committed.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.860]   And that was the teaching on this.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.900]   So remember last week's, the sin offering taught that there's different degrees of sin,
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.900]   right?
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.060]   And so that was the main teaching on that sin offering.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.060]   This one, that even though you may have sinned against God, damage that was done had to be
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.460]   paid back, okay?
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.760]   That's the main point of this particular offering.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:33.180]   The reason given that is required for this offering is twofold, okay?
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.020]   So we have the large category one, and the second one I'll get to in a minute, but the
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.540]   first category is when the sinner breached the holy things of God.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:54.020]   Breached, defiled, depending on what translation that you have, made impure, whatever was committed
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:00.100]   to God, and you somehow breached it, you defiled it by touching it or whatever it is that you
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:06.660]   did, you said this guilt offering was required.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.620]   Holy things that are described as anything dedicated by men to God, right?
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:18.960]   So again, the first category of the things that was required for this offering is anything
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.400]   that was dedicated to God, right?
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.520]   It could have been an animal, it could have been a particular offering, it could have
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.100]   been a house or land, anything that was dedicated to God, and somehow you either made it impure
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.100]   or you took it or you defiled it in some way where that could no longer be used.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.780]   So they had to go through a purification ceremony in order for that to be pure again, right?
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.660]   And that costs money, and it would require an animal sacrifice because the one who caused
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.180]   the defilement was the one who was required to pay that amount, and on top of that, add
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.180]   a fifth.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.940]   Okay, does that make sense?
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:02.100]   So this is just logistics, this is just what was required of them, right?
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.820]   So anything related to the Lord was considered holy, right?
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.780]   So it wasn't just the animals, it wasn't just a few things he said, anything that belonged
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.340]   to the Lord, it was set apart.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.860]   So the word holy itself means that anything that was set apart and said, "This is the
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.020]   Lord," it was holy.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:29.420]   So the Bible talks about various things that was considered holy or set apart for the Lord.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:35.460]   One of the top things that the Jews were constantly concerned about was his name, who he is, his
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.780]   reputation.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:42.820]   The Lord's name was to be holy, so we are commanded not to misuse it and take it in
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.540]   vain, swearing falsely by the name of the Lord violates and brings dishonor to the Lord
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.300]   in the Lord's prayer.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.860]   We pray for the sanctity of the Lord's name, right?
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:59.060]   And we talked about this before, how the Israelites were so concerned that they would use the
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:05.320]   Lord's name in vain, and by defiling his name by using it just frivolously, that they wouldn't
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.180]   even call his name out, right?
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.400]   They wouldn't ever use his name, Yahweh.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:19.840]   So that's part of the reason why we don't know if Yahweh is pronounced Yahweh or Yehoah,
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.900]   because they didn't pronounce it for so long, and the Hebrew didn't have vowels, and so
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.860]   later on, we look at it, and so in the Greek translation, they pronounce it one way, and
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.400]   the Hebrew, some people think it should be pronounced Yahweh, but that's because the
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.880]   Israelites refused to pronounce his name.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.320]   So the thing that they were concerned about, the top thing, one of the top things that
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.780]   they were concerned about was disrespecting God.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:51.560]   Now, I'm going to stop right there for a minute, because again, you and I live in a culture
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:59.540]   where reverence, it's almost kind of like cruel to be irreverent, you know?
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.960]   And when it comes to things of God, sometimes Christians are more insensitive to the things
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.700]   of God than non-Christians.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:13.280]   Because non-Christians, even if they don't believe God, when they step into the church,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:21.440]   they have this innate understanding that they're entering into something sacred, right?
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.400]   Christians who've been Christians for so long, it's kind of like, well, you know, what's
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.120]   the big deal?
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.800]   We don't have this, again, a lot of Christians, especially the ones who have been raised in
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.960]   the church, don't have this sense of reverence toward the things of God.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.040]   The Jews were so concerned about being irreverent toward God.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.260]   And I'm going to say something that, you know, that you may disagree with me, but I see this
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.060]   a lot happening today.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.520]   When I was growing up, nobody ever said, "Oh my God."
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:58.120]   Nobody ever said that, because the previous generation told us that was irreverent, that
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.880]   was using the Lord's name frivolously.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.580]   And I know that that's not the way people mean it when they say it, right?
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.580]   I know that that's not.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.300]   I mean, in fact, I don't know too many people who don't use that term today.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.320]   But I'm just telling you that the previous generation, and for many generations prior
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.420]   to that, that using the Lord's name, "Oh my God," was considered frivolous.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.340]   It was kind of like using God's name without any thought and kind of a joke and just like,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.820]   it was just used in a phrase.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:32.400]   And so when I first started hearing that and started seeing that online, yeah, it did kind
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.280]   of poke me the wrong way, right?
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.000]   And so I'm not here tonight saying like, you know, it's irreverent or you shouldn't be
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.320]   saying that.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:49.780]   But generally speaking, the idea of being reverent toward the things of God is a problem
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.340]   in our generation.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.080]   So I don't want to get, again, legalistic and say, "Well, this is reverent or this is
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.080]   irreverent.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.280]   So when you come to church, you need to wear a suit."
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.480]   And I'm not saying that at all.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.800]   But the concept of being reverent, because this particular sin is about taking something
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.400]   that is sacred and defiling it by being irreverent toward it.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.840]   And so when you recognize that you are irreverent toward something that God considered sacred
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.420]   and you realize that, that's when this offering was required, to come before the Lord and
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.120]   recognize that and pay reparation on top of that.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.140]   So the first thing that the Israelites considered sacred among all things was his name.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.640]   And they would never even pronounce his name because they were always afraid that it would
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.280]   be taken frivolously.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.000]   So I think that's something that we need to consider and think about, that we don't use
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.120]   the Lord's name frivolously.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.300]   Sabbath was kept holy.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.040]   It was kept to be reverent.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.160]   Unintentional Sabbath violation would be one of the things that required a guilt offering.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.200]   And this is, again, unintentional.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.560]   Remember what happened to somebody who intentionally violated the Sabbath?
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.080]   We talked about that last week.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.960]   Well, capital punishment.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.060]   It was to take him out, outside the gate, and there was capital punishment for him because
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.560]   a willful sin.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   Right?
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.760]   And again, we talked about that last week, how we define something that is deserving
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.080]   of capital punishment is the way it affects us.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:32.000]   The way God sees it is a person who looks at God and willfully says, "No, I'm going
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.180]   to do it my way."
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:38.520]   So the willful sin against God was a much more serious offense.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.560]   And so the second thing that they were constantly concerned about is keeping the Sabbath holy.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.840]   And the reason why is because it's spelled out in his commandments.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.200]   If you look at the laws in Deuteronomy, a huge chunk of the law is about keeping the
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.560]   Sabbath holy.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.640]   It's part of the Ten Commandments.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:03.080]   All the laws in the Ten Commandments are the weightiest of all the commandments in Deuteronomy,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.400]   and keeping the Sabbath holy was one of them.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.460]   So the Israelites understood how weighty this particular commandment was, whether they understood
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.680]   it or not.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:18.220]   But the Sabbath was a day that was set apart to revere God.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.640]   So to break the Sabbath is to basically willfully say, "We're not going to set this day apart."
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.040]   Again, it was a form of rebellion against God to break the Sabbath.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.160]   So Sabbath was one of those things.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.200]   So if you inadvertently did something that you weren't supposed to do on the Sabbath,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:41.060]   that was a requirement that they needed to bring the guilt offering to God.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.160]   The offerings in the temple rites were considered holy.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.400]   Anything that was set apart and that was dedicated to the temple that belonged to God became
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.040]   more sacred.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   So if there was an article, it was a particular animal, it could be even the priests.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.360]   Remember King David, how he wouldn't touch Saul because he said he was the anointed of
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:08.480]   God, even though he was trying to kill him and he refused to lay any harm on him because
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.880]   he realized that because he was a king set apart for God's use, even though he may have
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.200]   been rebellion, he said he wouldn't touch that because he understood that he was sacred
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.500]   for that purpose.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:26.280]   So anything that was set apart for God's use was considered sacred.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.600]   So if you've damaged that, if you touched it or if you defiled it in any way through
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.500]   speech or through action, it would require the guilt offering before God.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.520]   The nation of Israel was considered holy.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.780]   The Israelites were to be holy just as the Lord God was holy, not maintaining purity
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.280]   in their worship of one true God and by their intermarrying, they violated the Lord's holy
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280]   things.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.540]   So again, God wanted to keep the nation of Israel holy so he forbid them to intermarry
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.480]   with the Canaanites because he considered the nation of Israel as a whole holy and by
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.560]   bringing non-Israelites or pagan worshipers into the nation of Israel, it would defile
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.320]   the nation as a whole.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.080]   So that was considered sacred.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:22.240]   And then finally, failing to fulfill a dedicatory vow or to present a tithe.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:28.480]   A tithe again was something that was meant to be set apart for God's use so that tithe
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.080]   every month belonged to God.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:36.240]   So anytime you touched that, it was considered a violation of what was sacred.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.960]   So anything that was dedicated to the Lord and you somehow take back or you don't do
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.640]   what you intended to do, you're supposed to do, it was considered a violation.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.800]   Again that's all spelled out in Leviticus chapter 22.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.680]   When we get there, we'll talk a little bit more about that.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:18:00.840]   So this is not comprehensive but these are the major things that required Israel to give
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.560]   this offering.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.360]   Now every one of these things has a reflection in the New Testament.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:14.640]   It may not be letter by letter specifically but every one of these things have some sort
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.780]   of reflection in the New Testament which we'll get to when we get there.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:24.160]   The second category was a direct sin against the neighbor.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.280]   So the first one was a defiling of anything that was set apart that belonged to God, whether
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:35.160]   it was his name, whether it was the Sabbath, whether it was a particular offering or articles
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.880]   or a person, whether it was the nation as a whole or anything that was dedicated, right?
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.700]   So anything that belonged to God that was defiled, that was the first category.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:52.200]   The second category was anything that violated or when you sinned against a particular neighbor
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.840]   and then he kind of spells out and makes a list of things, right?
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.480]   Deceiving a neighbor in a matter of deposit or security, in other words that you're kind
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:18.020]   of in this business transaction and then you end up deceiving them or robbery.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.260]   We're going to stop here for a minute before we go on.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:32.480]   Now remember, in the first case concerning God, defiling God, what was the requirement?
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.480]   Intentional or unintentional?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.640]   Unintentional, right?
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.480]   It was not a deliberate breaking of the Sabbath.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.600]   It wasn't deliberately defiling the name of the Lord, right?
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.840]   It wasn't a direct sin against God.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.440]   It was a mistake, right?
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:57.320]   But the second category is robbery unintentional?
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.880]   Robbery is intentional.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.200]   Lying, right?
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.840]   You found something and you lied about it.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.000]   How can that be unintentional?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.540]   So if you look at the sins listed here, it's very intentional.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:17.320]   So the distinction that he's making here are intentional sins that you voluntarily confess.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.840]   Because if you look at Exodus chapter 22, 1 through 4, he describes a penalty for an
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.120]   involuntary sin.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.120]   Let me rephrase that.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.520]   A sin that you don't voluntarily expose.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.060]   You get caught doing that, right?
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:40.840]   So this guilt offering that he makes a reparation for are sins that he recognized that he did
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.240]   and he's confessing and he wants to make things right, right?
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.840]   And in that case, he says to give whatever you took and then you add a fifth as a compensation,
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.560]   kind of like added interest on top of that.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:59.560]   But if you go to Exodus chapter 22, which let me get there real quick, right?
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.520]   He says, "If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills or sells it, he shall repay," how
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.520]   many times?
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.360]   "Five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep."
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.480]   And then all the way down to verse 4, "If the stolen beast is found alive in his possession,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.240]   whether it is an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall pay double."
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.520]   So much more than that.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.600]   200%, 400%, 500%.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.880]   So this is a description of somebody who gets caught doing this.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.560]   He's not voluntarily confessing.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.160]   He got caught, right?
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:39.200]   So what we're dealing with here is somebody who commits these crimes, commits these sins,
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.040]   but he feels guilt.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.500]   That's why we call it guilt offering.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:50.400]   So the way he deals with the guilt is to confess it before God and make things right.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.600]   You following?
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.320]   So this is not just talking about, well, you went out and robbed somebody and then you
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.680]   got caught and you say, okay, now you got to pay whatever you robbed and the fifth.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:07.600]   This is only in the case that you voluntarily are dealing with your guilt.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:15.100]   Otherwise the reparation would have been much more severe.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:20.300]   And let me just expand on this just a little bit.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.620]   The reason why this is called a guilt offering is because of this.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.260]   Not simply because you're guilty, because all sins make you guilty.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:33.480]   This is a guilt offering because there's a guilt on your conscience.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.200]   Because you did something and you violated God's law and then you've taken something
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.960]   that didn't belong to you and so you deal with this guilt by confessing and then you're
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.300]   making things right.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.820]   We have a, again, I think I mentioned this last Sunday, I think in the first service,
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.540]   where there's this confusion in the church that any guilt is not from God.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:00.740]   And if you feel guilty, it's legalism.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:08.900]   It is not, because Paul in 1 Corinthians spells out the sins of the Corinthians.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:14.640]   In fact, he's so angry with these people, he says, "Shall I come to you with a whip
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   or in love?"
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   I mean, he's talking as a father who's disciplining his kids and he uses the harshest language
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.580]   that he can possibly use.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:28.300]   And then when he writes the 2 Corinthians, he begins by saying that, "I regretted it
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:32.100]   a little bit because I was so harsh with you, but I did not regret it because your guilt
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.380]   led to repentance."
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:40.220]   In other words, he brought guilt on them on purpose to reveal their sin.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.820]   And he says, "Godly sorrow leads to repentance.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.180]   Worldly sorrow leads to condemnation."
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.820]   So the issue wasn't the guilt.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.780]   So if you take that guilt and whatever you do with that guilt will either lead to salvation
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.980]   or it will lead to greater condemnation.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:03.500]   So we make the mistake to think that when there is guilt and we don't want to deal with
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.020]   the sin that is causing the guilt because the way that God told the nation of Israel
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.940]   to deal with that guilt is to repent and make things right.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.100]   But the way that people want to make it, when guilt is upon us, we can't live with that
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.180]   guilt for a long time.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.540]   Because guilt is, I mean, it'll ruin your appetite.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.540]   It ruins relationships.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:33.020]   And there is deep-seated heaviness upon us when there's guilt that the sin that we're
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.260]   not dealing with.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:39.300]   So that will either lead us to repentance and make things right or you change your theology
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.420]   to make your sin okay.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:47.180]   And you start calling sin not sin.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:54.980]   So you start to change your theology to accommodate the sin that you want in your life.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.020]   But the Holy Spirit will not allow you to do that.
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:04.640]   The Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us will bring the guilt upon us to bring us to repentance.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:10.260]   So guilt in itself is necessary to bring us to repentance.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.060]   How do you repent if there is no guilt?
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.060]   How do you repent?
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.420]   Remember when Peter preached the gospel?
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.420]   How did they respond?
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.420]   They were what?
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.420]   Cut to the heart.
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.980]   What did it mean to be cut to the heart?
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.540]   They recognized their own sin.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.260]   And they said, "What do we do?
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.180]   Repent and be baptized."
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.960]   That's the gospel message, to repent and be baptized, right?
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.060]   So the reason why this particular offering is called the guilt offering is how do you
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.540]   deal with guilt of sin?
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.260]   And this is what he's saying.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.340]   He says sin of oppression of the neighbors.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:54.820]   If someone found something that somebody lost and they kept it and lied about it, and then
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:59.500]   the guilt weighs heavy on his heart, and then he wants to make things right and he wants
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.180]   to repent, so this guilt offering was given.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.620]   So whatever he took, right?
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.620]   He didn't just give it back.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:15.380]   He said, "You need to give it back and then you add 20% as if it was loaned to you."
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.020]   Because if that's the money that he would have gotten, if he lent it to somebody else,
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.820]   he would have gotten 20% back.
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.500]   So basically if you're going to restore, you have to restore like you borrowed it from
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:33.620]   him, right?
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.860]   What did this sacrifice particularly teach?
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.860]   Things that are considered sacred or holy in the New Testament.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.100]   The Lord's name, right?
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:51.060]   Remember what Jesus says in the Lord's prayer, "Thy kingdom come," or he begins by saying,
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.740]   "Hallowed be thy name," right?
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.860]   That's the first part of the Lord's prayer.
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:01.660]   And that was the first thing that the Jews were concerned about in the Old Testament.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:07.220]   They would never say his name in vain because it was considered so sacred.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:12.100]   It revered him, anything that was attached to him.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.140]   So the first thing in the New Testament, again we see the reflection in the New Testament,
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:21.860]   is that his name, anything that is attached to God, there ought to be among Christians
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.760]   a reverence.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:30.100]   And there is nothing more sacred than the gathering of his people for the purpose of
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.460]   corporate worship.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:38.020]   So our corporate worship shouldn't be casual, right?
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.020]   It shouldn't be casual.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.980]   Again, I'm not going to spell out what that means.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.540]   I'm not going to say, "Therefore, you need to buy a tie," or any of this.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.780]   I'm not saying all of that because I read somewhere that more than 70% of the people
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.140]   in the United States, like 7% of the men don't own a suit.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.380]   So it doesn't make sense to go buy a suit just to attend church, right?
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.260]   So I am not saying that at all.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.740]   But in our hearts, when we approach that, this is not, you're not coming to a theater.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.260]   And that's why we say on Sunday morning not to come in here with boba, okay?
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.340]   And it's not because we're concerned about the chairs.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.100]   As you can see, the chairs are vinyl.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.980]   So even if you spill things, we can clean it up.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.580]   We're not concerned about cleanliness.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.580]   That's not why.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.460]   It's not because it distracts me when I see you drinking something.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.460]   That's not why.
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.540]   It's to teach you that the time that we're coming here is a sacred time.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.540]   It is not.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.540]   You didn't come to watch a movie, right?
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.740]   You didn't come here and just sip in your sip.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.580]   It's like, "Okay, let me see what you're going to do today," right?
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:42.620]   We're asking you to come with a sense of reverence when you come approach the throne of God.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.800]   That's why another reason why we're asking you to come a bit early, right, and ready
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   your hearts.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.100]   Instead of just casually walking in, come and prepare your hearts, okay?
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:55.900]   Some of you guys are thinking, "Egalism, egalism," right?
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.180]   They all have a reason.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.620]   Again, I didn't understand that when I was younger either.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.780]   When my dad would tell me to do certain things or not do certain things in the church when
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:11.780]   I was younger, I said, "Man, what does that have to do with worshipping God?"
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.620]   What he told me was so much more stricter than even what I'm saying to you.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.020]   But I didn't understand that when I was younger.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.420]   I don't necessarily agree with all of the things that I was taught, but I understand
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.180]   it now.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:29.660]   I understand it now because the more I study the Scriptures, the more I understand why
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:36.420]   he wants us to have reverence and to revere the things of God because it reveals the attitude
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.620]   of our hearts.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.660]   And when our attitude of our hearts toward God is nonchalant, his word is going to be
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.660]   taken nonchalantly.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.540]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.580]   If somebody you revere tells you something, you're going to pay attention to it a lot
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:59.220]   more closely than somebody that you're just really casual about, right?
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.620]   And ultimately, it really isn't even about you.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.260]   It's about him.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:08.620]   If honoring and glorifying him is the primary purpose of my life, that's something that
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.100]   we should consider and think about, think through, right, whenever it has to deal with
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.100]   God.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:21.300]   His name, the gospel itself, right?
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.100]   The gospel itself is the foundation upon which everything rises and falls.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.580]   So if there's anything that we need to consider sacred, it's the gospel, that we are not to
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.820]   turn from it to the left or to the right, that we don't tweak it, we don't change it,
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.940]   we don't emphasize one over the other.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:41.420]   When we talk about grace and not holiness, right, we talk about holiness but not grace,
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:48.020]   we need to preach the full gospel, like all of it, and we need to pay very close attention
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:54.740]   to it because all of the false doctrines and heresies are a small, tiny tweak of the gospel,
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.740]   right?
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.620]   It is not an outright, like we don't believe that he, you know, he wasn't resurrected,
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.460]   I mean, there are some outright heresies but most of the stuff that affects the church
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.100]   and divides the church are a slight tweak of the gospel.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:13.300]   And that's why Paul says, right, in Galatians 1, 8 and 9, if anybody preaches a different
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.020]   gospel, now, when he says anybody preaches a different gospel, let him be anathema, let
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:24.380]   him be accursed, understand a different gospel that he was dealing with.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:31.380]   The Judaizers, they recognized Jesus' resurrection, they recognized his lordship, right?
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:39.260]   So the core doctrines of the gospel, they believe, they just wanted to add circumcision,
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.540]   they wanted to add these other things.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.620]   And so when Paul says anathema, he's not talking to people who are saying that Jesus Christ
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.820]   isn't God, that he wasn't resurrected from the dead, that his blood didn't atone for
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:55.380]   our sins, he's talking about people who accepted that and then they added more things.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:01.340]   And he said that perversion causes the gospel to no longer be the gospel and he said, "Let
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.340]   him be anathema."
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.260]   That's how important the gospel is.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:10.980]   So if there's anything that you and I, that we need to study and know front and back,
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.060]   right?
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.540]   Not about Lakers and the statistics and not about, you know, like where's the best to
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.060]   travel and the best Yelp, I mean, all of that stuff are things that we have privilege to
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.060]   know.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:30.900]   But if you know more about the Lakers than the gospel, you have priority issues, right?
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:36.940]   If you know more about the politics than you do the gospel, you know, we have to take a
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.020]   step back and ask ourselves, like, what is it that we're doing?
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.560]   What are we doing with our time?
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.140]   And when I say know the gospel, I'm not just talking about, you know, like what you heard
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.180]   when you first started, right?
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:56.400]   You know, it surprises me, I can sit down and ask a Christian who's been a Christian
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:03.420]   for 10 plus years and explain if a non-Christian came to you and asked you, right, why was
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.820]   Jesus' blood necessary?
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.660]   How few people can answer that question?
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.640]   Why didn't he just forgive us?
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:20.380]   Why go through all that trauma of going to the cross, right?
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:25.940]   When we're in our insulated bubble, when nobody is challenging us, we just accept it.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.580]   We don't think about it.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.300]   So when you go witnessing and talk to non-Christians or a liberal Christian, they start asking
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.560]   you these questions, you realize you really don't know the gospel, right?
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.580]   Or you know the very elementary aspects of the gospel.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.300]   So if there's anything that you need to master is the gospel.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.660]   If you've been a Christian for more than a couple years, if somebody asks you a question
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:51.740]   about the gospel, you shouldn't say, "Go talk to my pastor," right?
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:57.220]   I'm not saying I don't want to talk to them, but Christians should be able to, any Christian
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.700]   should be able to answer those questions, right?
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.380]   At least, and if you don't know, ask, right?
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:10.260]   Ask a pastor, take a class, read a book, right, because the information is more than readily
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.260]   available.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.140]   So again, second thing, if there's anything that we need to get right and we need to consider
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:21.340]   sacred is the gospel itself, right?
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:26.020]   The church.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.460]   The gospel is sacred, the church is sacred because the avenue in which the gospel, what
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.980]   God designed the gospel to be spread, is the church.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:41.100]   So if anybody who is divisive in the church, or undermines the church, right, is also guilty
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:47.100]   of this sin, was divisive in the church, right?
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:54.260]   In 1 Timothy 3.15, it said the church is the foundation, the pillar and foundation of the
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.260]   truth.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.940]   And then, you know this passage, 1 Corinthians 3.16, "Do you not know that you are God's
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:04.900]   temple and it is used in the plural form, you, referring to the church, and that God's
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.020]   spirit dwells in you?"
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.060]   The church is a sacred place that replaced the sacred temple of the Old Testament.
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:16.140]   So when you come into the temple and you take the things that are sacred and you defile
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.660]   it, he said it's no different than in the church in the New Testament.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.220]   The church is the temple of God, right?
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:25.220]   So all these things that they were tolerating in the church, they were defiling the church.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:30.500]   So a Jew would have understood exactly what Paul was saying, right?
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.060]   You need to take this sin seriously.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.020]   You need to take the church seriously because this is God's design.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.580]   So going against the church, and again, we're not talking about like whatever the leaders
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:46.120]   say, everybody needs to submit, but undermining and defiling the church and dividing the church
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:51.100]   is a very, very serious offense, right?
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:56.340]   Because this is set apart for God's use.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.980]   Our bodies itself.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:06.860]   The scripture says that we have been purchased by Christ, so we belong to him.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:12.340]   So for us to use our bodies to do whatever we want with it is a violation of that, again,
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.340]   sacred command.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.320]   Every single Christian has been set apart for God's use.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:23.480]   It is no longer us who lives, but Christ who lives in us, right?
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:28.200]   That's why again, Romans 12.1, which says to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.880]   for God's use.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:37.600]   Again, so therefore, Paul calls our individual bodies also as a temple of God.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.680]   Again, 1 Corinthians 6, 19 to 20.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.720]   It's almost verbatim, the same passage in 1 Corinthians 3, 16, except there it's used
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.640]   in the singular, and he's referring to sexual immorality, right?
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:56.760]   Where in 1 Corinthians 3, 16, he warns the church in the context of being divisive.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:02.320]   You know, I prefer this guy, and I follow Paul, and this divisiveness was causing all
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.920]   this chaos in the church, and he's saying, "Do you not know that you are the temple of
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.920]   God?"
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.600]   So he's talking to the church and people who are being divisive.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.400]   Here in 1 Corinthians 6, 19, he's talking about sexual immorality, how they're using
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.760]   their bodies in a way that defiles what belongs to God.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.680]   It is not your body to use the way you want, okay?
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.720]   So that's the fourth thing.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.240]   And then the last thing is the sacrament, right?
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.800]   The Lord's Supper, and why this is so sacred.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.280]   First Corinthians 10, 14 to 21, and for the sake of time, I'm not going to read it.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   I don't think I have the passage.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.640]   I don't.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:48.200]   In the end, basically, he talks about the Lord's Supper as being most holy, right?
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.440]   And it is a replacement of the offerings in Leviticus.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.280]   And that's why in chapter 11, he said those people who weren't taking the Lord's Supper
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.200]   seriously, what was happening to them?
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:06.760]   What was happening to people who were not taking the Lord's Supper seriously?
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.360]   They were dying.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.680]   They said, well, they called it they fell asleep, but fell asleep basically means that
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   they were dying, right?
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.280]   And this is the New Testament, the new covenant, right?
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.080]   So it's not like we come, well, in the New Testament, so God doesn't care.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.480]   Actually, right, the first sin where they lie to the Holy Spirit, remember we talked
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   about that?
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   It was them.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   They died.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.640]   They took what was sacred to God.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.960]   They were lying to the Holy Spirit, lying to the church, and as a result of that, the
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.440]   consequence was very severe.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.120]   And the people who are not taking the Lord's Supper seriously, the consequence was very
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   severe.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.960]   Now, it doesn't mean that God says, well, if you break this commandment, you do it in
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.040]   irreverence that everybody's going to die.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:55.000]   But it does teach us how God views these things, how God views the church, right?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.840]   How God views the sacrament.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.320]   That's why it says not to participate in an unworthy manner.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.120]   So every time we take communion, it's an opportunity for us to take a deep look at where we are.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:10.480]   If we have deliberate, unconfessed sin, that you can't come up and participate in the communion
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.960]   table, right?
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.480]   And then some people think that, well, then I'm not going to participate.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   I'll be safe and not participate.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   To not participate in the communion table means that you are outside the church, right?
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.000]   So it's a lose-lose situation.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.800]   Well, then what do we do?
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.680]   Well, what do you think I want you to do?
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.840]   Repent, right?
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.840]   Confess your sins.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.840]   Get right with God.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.640]   That's what the communion table was meant to do, is for the church to realize that to
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.680]   participate in this sacred event, that you needed to continually confess your sins and
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.200]   recognize that the only redemption you have is in His blood.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.560]   So it's an opportunity for us to celebrate.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.160]   It is an opportunity for us to repent.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.680]   It is an opportunity for the church to be restored.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.840]   And it's an opportunity for us to look forward for the consummation of what He started at
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.420]   the cross, right?
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.420]   So it's sacred.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:11.160]   That's why the communion is so important to the church, right?
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.840]   And some people say, well, then why don't we do it every week?
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.320]   It is symbolic.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.800]   We don't believe that there is a real presence of Christ, meaning that there's some dynamic
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.640]   presence of Christ that's there physically, like the Catholics or the Lutherans.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   It is symbolic.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   But just because it's symbolic doesn't mean it's not sacred, because the Lord said it
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:41.440]   was sacred, right?
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.120]   The trespass offering illustrates the costs of sin that are committed.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.480]   That's not just something you say, oh, I feel bad, Lord, forgive me, and then you just move
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.780]   on, right?
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:41:03.840]   This particular offering reminds us that there is, in any sin, there's always consequences.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.960]   We confess it, just like a broken arm, it can be healed, but that arm may not always
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   be the same.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.380]   There are consequences for breaking.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:17.280]   So this commandment, this particular offering, reminds us of that.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.300]   So though forgiveness is given through atonement, there always is a price to pay for sins that
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.900]   bring damage to someone or something else.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:31.180]   True repentance requires restoration, as John told the Pharisees to bear fruit in accordance
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.180]   with repentance.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:37.480]   And let me look at some passages here.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:42.060]   So in Matthew 5, 23 to 24, it says, so if you are offering your gift at the altar and
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.780]   there, remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.260]   the altar and go.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:52.820]   First be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer your gift.
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:59.980]   So again, in restoration, that this is not just like, I confess before God, and forgive
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   me, and then you're done.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.100]   He said, whatever it is that you wronged with your brother, he says to deal with that before
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.500]   you come to the altar.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:12.060]   If you remember Zacchaeus, Luke 19, 8, Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, behold, Lord,
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:16.580]   the half of my goods I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone, anything,
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.700]   I restore it fourfold.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.860]   Now why is he saying fourfold?
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:27.540]   Because he was a Jew, he understood the Jewish law.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   He understood.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.140]   Now, was it required for him to be fourfold?
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.100]   No, it said 20%.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.360]   Why is he doing a fourfold?
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.620]   He recognizes his sin.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.300]   It's just like Peter saying, how many times do you want me to forgive?
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.540]   Seven times?
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.260]   He wasn't required to give it seven times.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:48.380]   He was trying to say he's going to be more righteous than the average person.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:53.140]   So Zacchaeus, when he says I'm going to give fourfold, is basically saying this is how
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.940]   much I'm repenting.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:04.100]   Because he knew what the Jewish law said.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:11.780]   And then God gives provision for restoration when we volunteer in repentance.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:17.980]   There's a big difference between a sin that gets exposed versus a sin that you expose.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:25.500]   And God gives restoration when we volunteer that.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:32.260]   And so Isaiah 53.10 says, "Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him, and he has
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.820]   put him into grief.
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:38.420]   When his soul makes an offering for sin, he shall see his offering, he shall prolong his
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.900]   days, the Lord shall prosper in his hand."
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:49.580]   So the word for here for offering, I think it's the NASB and maybe the NIV also says
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.460]   guilt offering.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:57.040]   It's the same word that is used in this passage in Leviticus 5.16, guilt offering.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:03.380]   So I'm not sure why the ESV just translated offering.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.860]   My guess is they're assuming that you don't know the difference.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.300]   So just like, well, offering is an offering.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:15.380]   And it's part of the reason why I'm not a big fan of the ESV, even though I use the
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.060]   ESV.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:22.300]   I think they did too much of this kind of stuff to make it a little bit easier to read,
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.840]   but I think this is important enough that they should have put it in there.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:32.100]   But in the Hebrew, it actually has the word guilt offering on there.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.960]   Same word that is being used here in Leviticus 5.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.460]   So basically what is it saying?
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.460]   It's saying that Christ fulfilled this.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.540]   He was our guilt offering.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:46.740]   And then finally 1 John 1, 8-9, it says, "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.300]   and the truth is not in us."
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.980]   And that's the first part of deception, when we don't recognize our sin or we don't see
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.900]   the gravity of our sin.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:04.220]   And so all these five offerings, the purpose of all these five offerings is to recognize
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.940]   the depravity of sin, how God sees sin.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.700]   And it's very detailed.
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:17.340]   How can a holy God be in the midst of sinful people?
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:21.640]   And so every one of these things, that the offering that was given from morning and nighttime,
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.580]   the blood that was shed, the sprinkling of the blood, and the money, the compensation,
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:32.540]   the fifth of it, and then if you were a leader versus a layperson versus a priest.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:38.340]   And so every one of these offerings was God was detailing.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.340]   He was detailing.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.700]   Like if you're going to build a house, you have an architect.
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.540]   I don't know if you've ever seen the architect's blueprint.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:52.620]   I was surprised how many pages of drawings go into a church like this.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:57.060]   Maybe about 200, 300 pages.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:04.340]   Because when I first found out how much it cost to hire an architect, as high as 10%
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.540]   of whatever your project is.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:10.500]   So if a project is a million dollars, they project about $100,000 for the architect.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.700]   And I said, what?
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.620]   That's what they project.
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.340]   Now we didn't pay that, but that's what they project.
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.780]   And I said, why would they do that?
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.860]   Until I saw what they actually did.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:27.340]   Because every little thing, even the nail that you use, like on these walls, the nails
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:33.620]   that we use, it had to be a certain kind of galvanized nail, a certain length, and that
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:40.060]   you can only get in a certain width and certain head that was used only for concrete.
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.620]   And so when the inspector came, he made us go up and pull these nails out because he
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:49.500]   wanted to see if we used the right nail.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.820]   It's that detailed.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:57.860]   So imagine if they were that detailed about the nail, how crazy it was around the building.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:03.780]   We had to take out a certain part of the entrance because the grade on the entrance was 1.2%.
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:10.980]   And he said, 2% or something, but it had to fall in line with like 1% to 2%.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.700]   If anything above that, we had to take the whole thing out and repave the whole thing
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.140]   for ADA access.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:24.380]   Now I share all of this because we don't realize all the little details and the things
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:30.300]   that they made us do, and all for the purpose of making the building safe.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.380]   And especially in Irvine, they don't cut corners.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.380]   They don't cut corners at all.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:40.820]   And everybody's afraid to come to Irvine for that reason, but they're doing it because
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:46.140]   they want to make sure that all the buildings in Irvine are safe.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:50.220]   So when you look at the offerings that God is giving, all the little intricate details,
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.380]   like an architect building a house.
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.500]   And every one of these things that we may not understand, why do you have to have that
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.500]   nail?
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.500]   Why does it have to be that long?
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.500]   Why does it have to be galvanized?
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.500]   Why does it have to be three inches?
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.140]   And there has to be six inches.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.580]   There has to be two of them.
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.780]   And so all these little things that you and I may not understand, but the architect knows,
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.460]   the engineer knows, right?
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.700]   Because he's building a house that maybe you and I don't fully understand.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:19.860]   And every single one of these things that he did in these offerings, it built toward
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.940]   the coming of Christ.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.980]   It built toward pointing to what Jesus was going to do on the cross.
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.180]   So when you look at the intricate details of these offerings, what did it teach us?
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:38.380]   Like, generally, structurally, what did it teach us?
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.860]   Sin is very serious in the eyes of God.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:49.380]   And if we don't recognize sin as utterly sinful, we don't really understand what Christ
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.860]   came to do.
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.900]   We can sing about his love and his grace, but it just doesn't have the same impact as
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.980]   somebody who really understands what sin is.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:02.740]   So he said all of this was given to us for what purpose?
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:07.260]   To make sin orderly sinful.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:12.300]   Orderly sinful, not just sinful, but orderly sinful, as sinful as you can possibly understand
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.300]   it.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:20.140]   Because until you recognize it as orderly sinful, the grace of God doesn't change you,
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.260]   right?
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.700]   Until you realize that you are on the verge of death or you were dead in your trespasses.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.220]   Of course, he died for us.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:32.940]   But it doesn't change your life.
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.140]   It doesn't change the way you use your money.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.700]   It doesn't change where you have fun.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:42.020]   It's just precious, but just not as precious.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:50.220]   Again, so I want you guys to really think through what you guys are studying.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:58.100]   This is God's architectural design, and every single one of these things are there for a
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.620]   reason.
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:03.860]   Even if you don't understand now, file it away somewhere, and it may trigger it at some
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:04.860]   point.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.860]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:06.860]   [inaudible]
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:29.860]   Often, would one particular family give this offering?
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:39.980]   You wouldn't have enough animals to do that.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:49.900]   It was done on a daily basis at the tabernacle, but this doesn't mean that every family was
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.220]   doing it on a daily basis.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.700]   I have a feeling, again, that's a good question, but I have a feeling that there was a long
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.700]   line.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:50:59.700]   [inaudible]
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:00.700]   Right, right.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:17.980]   Yeah, so my guess is that the Israelites probably were not very faithful with it either.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:28.140]   Israelites, even while they're in the desert, they were going after idols, constantly grumbling
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.140]   and complaining.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:33.940]   So do you think that they were faithful in giving in their sacrifices that cost them
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.020]   this money?
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:43.020]   So my guess is that a lot of them did the minimum, and then there were periods of revival
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:48.060]   when the temple was established and there was more giving and more of that being established,
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:52.620]   but even then, they were just doing that like the rich people were doing that.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:57.340]   Remember, like if you look at Isaiah and Jeremiah, there's a rebuke, and they say, "You're coming
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:02.180]   to the temple, but it's a trampling of my court," and he said that the fast that he
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:08.420]   desire is to look after the orphans and the oppressed, and who is he rebuking?
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.000]   The rich people, right?
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.140]   The rich people who had the money and the sacrifice, they're coming to the temple and
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:18.260]   giving all of these things, and so because they were able to do that, they thought that
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.340]   they were right with God, right?
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:25.740]   But he says, "They're a burden to him," right?
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:30.460]   So people who didn't have money may have made that as an excuse and not come to God because
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:35.380]   they didn't have money for these animals, and the rich people were just kind of giving
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:41.420]   meaningless offerings, and so God says, "No, that's not what I wanted either," right?
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:45.060]   So I don't know how frequent, I mean, even if it's just a small portion of them came,
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:50.780]   I would think that it would have been a really bloody scene, and it was done all the time,
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:55.100]   morning and night constantly, but again, it doesn't mean that, you know, like every time
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.140]   they sinned, they brought an animal.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:02.700]   My guess is they probably waited once a year, or it was something that kind of rose up to
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:08.660]   that point, and maybe a few faithful, really faithful Jews did it on a regular basis.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.260]   That's my guess.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:17.780]   But again, remember, Israelites were not faithful, right?
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.700]   All right.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:26.660]   So the discussion questions, other than feeling of guilt, how does sin damage the sinner?
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:27.660]   Give specific examples.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:32.340]   Okay, number two, in what way does our private sins affect the church as a whole?
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:37.420]   Sometimes we don't realize that if we're the temple of God, we're the body of Christ, and
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:41.460]   if your arm gets hurt, right, we all hurt, the scripture says, but we don't necessarily
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.020]   sometimes think that, right?
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:47.540]   And so how does our private sins affect the whole church?
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:51.300]   So that's, again, you understand that.
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:56.940]   Number three, how do you balance between overcoming sin through accountability and discipleship
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.460]   while creating an atmosphere of transparency and grace?
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:05.260]   Okay, so this is the constant challenge, and even when you're raising kids, like you want
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.180]   to disciple them and discipline them when they're wrong, but then you don't want to
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:11.180]   discipline to the point where they're afraid of you, and they'll never come to you, and
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.700]   they're always hiding from you, right?
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:18.380]   And so that balance is a challenge even in the church where you kind of like, well, we
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.300]   want to be gracious, and we want people to feel safe where they can confess their sins,
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:26.100]   and the next thing you know, everybody's like, well, you're a sinner, I'm a sinner, and then
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:31.300]   you create an environment where sin is okay because everybody's sinning together, right?
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:35.460]   Or you go to the other extreme where you put fear and trembling that we're watching, we're
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:39.260]   constantly asking each other, are you sinning, are you doing this, are you doing that, and
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:43.660]   you're almost afraid to come to church, and we don't want that either, right?
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.420]   So how do we balance them?
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:51.020]   That's a constant challenge because we always tend to err one way or the other, or you kind
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.780]   of gravitate one toward the other, right?
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.980]   But you can't ignore either, right?
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.580]   Because God is holy and God is love at the same time all the time.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:05.380]   There's not a time when, okay, we're not going to talk about holiness now because we want
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:09.260]   to focus on God's love, or we're going to focus on His holiness, not His love.
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:14.340]   There's never a time when His holiness and His love shouldn't be present at all times
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.880]   in everything that we do, right?
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.180]   So the question is, how do we balance that, right, without neglecting the other?
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:25.660]   Four, do you have a tendency to keep sin private or do you regularly confess your sins to others
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.300]   asking for accountability?
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:33.140]   And again, you know, we can easily hold things back, right, and just keep it to ourselves,
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:39.060]   but when we do that, the sin tends to fester and it becomes bigger, right, as we saw.
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:42.480]   And so God always gives opportunity for us to, that's why the scripture says in James
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.260]   to confess your sins to one another, right, to bring it out.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:51.580]   So if we bring it out, it has a lesser impact, but if we are waiting for it to get exposed,
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:55.100]   we get humiliated and the damage is much bigger, right?
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:56:01.500]   So again, that question is, is there a pattern in your life where you're willing to confess,
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.000]   you know, when there is sin in your life?
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.580]   So that's, again, question number four, okay?
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:14.660]   So let me pray for us and then I'll have you guys get into your groups.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:19.060]   Heavenly Father, we ask that you would anoint a time with a small group.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:24.980]   Lord, as we continue to wrestle, Lord God, of what it means to be holy and at the same
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:31.700]   time being gracious and loving, help us, Lord, to be obedient and faithful to you in all
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.580]   aspects.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:38.460]   If we are overly harsh, reveal that to us.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:44.500]   If we have accepted sin, Lord God, and just been in the habit of making light of holiness,
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.820]   I pray that you would reveal that to us as well.
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:53.660]   I pray that you would be with us in our discussion, that it would lead to greater sanctification
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.700]   and honoring of your name.
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:57.460]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:07.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
