[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Hello church family, my name is Chris Choi and this is my testimony. I was born into a Christian family to two loving parents at around age seven.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   My father introduced the gospel to me, who's sitting here with us today. He introduced to me a man named Jesus and told me he died on a cross for you because he loves you and if you believe in him as your Lord and Savior,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   then your sins will be forgiven. You won't have to go to a place called hell and you will be able to have eternal life in heaven with God as long as you believe in him.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I believe this was the beginning of my salvation because I hung my life to this truth, but at this point I mainly just did not want to be punished for eternity.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I only had a minimal understanding of the gospel, if anything just a piece of the gospel.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Growing up I attended a charismatic church where I was able to understand more and more of who Jesus was, how he loves us, understand more about his mercy upon us.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Life was good growing up. We lived very comfortably with little worries in life.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Yes, I was very much a sinner and had many flaws. Undeserving of his grace, was a liar, cheater, pursued my lust, disobeyed my parents in authority.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   You name the sin, I committed it. But thank God I did have the desire to have my sins forgiven and wanted to repent before God.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   However, growing up I would say my faith was only steadily growing.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Also, I remember thinking to myself, life is too good right now.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   But when I read a Bible, it talks about how Christians will face trials of various kinds.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Well, in 2008, I was 18 years old, entering my senior year of high school. Everything came crashing down.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   That year my grandfather passed away, my father lost his job, we lost our house, we lost everything.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And the worst news of all, my mother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It was not a good time, but I knew a day like this was going to come and I knew in order to persevere I needed to depend on God.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   The following year, I got accepted to UCI and needed to find a new church.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Through a parachurch, I was able to visit Brean.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   At the time, Brean was meeting at some janky middle school and singing hymns that I was not familiar with.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   As a boy who was used to jumping up and down and shouting to more contemporary music, I had to just stand there and sing to much slower songs.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   At this point, I thought this was going to just be another church to check off the list as I was visiting other churches.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Then I listened to the sermon and thought it was unusual how Pastor Peter kept going back to the word after each segment.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And this type of preaching was very new to me.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I remember after church ended that day, I went back to my college dorm room and just laid there on my bed and thought,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   "Perhaps it was the Holy Spirit tugging at me, telling me that I needed to continue to attend Brean."
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Throughout college, I was on fire for the word.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I wanted to learn more and more about the Bible.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It was the thing that I was missing in my life.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I believe that even though I had the basic understanding of the gospel growing up, my faith was only barely steadily growing.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   But once I started to indulge into the word, my faith grew exponentially.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Reading upon true doctrine helped solidify the foundation of my faith.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I was a starving, weak, spiritual child. I needed to be fed.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I would go to all the Bible studies, met up with older brothers and pastors.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Even during the summers when most students would go back home, I didn't want to go back home.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I wanted to stay in Irvine and learn more about the word.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   The following year, in 2010, my sophomore year of college, my mother fought three good years but eventually passed away.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   This was the most difficult time in my life. Death became real to me.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I knew death was imminent and life here on earth was temporary.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Everything I had learned from the Bible at this point helped me to persevere and understand that this was all part of God's will and plan.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And I was also thankful to God, praising God that He had saved my mother,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and I am confident that she is in a better place worshipping God in heaven today.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Most people would have despised God for losing such a loved one, but I had peace in my heart.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And this gave me confidence and assurance of my faith, and praise God for that.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   To this day, today, still a sinner, I come before God repenting of my sins.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   The older I get, I understand more and more of how utterly sinful I am,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   but I also understand more and more how great God's grace is.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   It is truly an amazing gospel.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Still a student of the word, still so much to learn.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Today, my wife and I are looking forward to our first child, our daughter who is due to be born next week.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I look forward to having a glimpse, a different perspective and understanding more of God's love for His children,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   displaying my own love for my child.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Thank you all for witnessing my baptism today, and I thank God for this day,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and may all praise and glory be to our Father. Thank you.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   [applause]
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   All right, Chris, do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in His death,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   and that when you come out, you're uniting with His resurrected life?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yes, I do.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   [applause]
