[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080]   All right, Bering Community Church, this is a pre-study of the first Thessalonians.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.000]   I wanted to just kind of go over and test out this new format.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.200]   And so I'm just going to give you a brief introduction.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.920]   The real introduction is going to happen next week when we formally start, but this is to
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.800]   kind of get you ready for that first session.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.440]   And I also want to test this thing out.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.440]   So be patient.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.400]   We're going to try to work out the kinks as we go.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.240]   Again, this is an inductive Bible study through first Thessalonians.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.840]   And so again, the goal of the inductive Bible study that we're trying to do is to, one,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.560]   learn how to study the Bible.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.560]   So learn how to study the Bible.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.600]   That's the first thing that we want to do.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920]   The goal of it is not for me to do the study and then to present to you what I found.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.200]   So this is very different than what we do on Sunday.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.400]   It's really to kind of, my role here is to guide you through how to study the Bible.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.360]   So if you don't study the Bible for yourself, you're not going to get as much out of it.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.960]   In fact, I would say the study is going to be very frustrating.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.960]   You're going to be frustrated for yourself.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.160]   You're going to be frustrated in the small group that you're with because you're expected
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.000]   to bring and contribute and not just to listen.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.080]   And so no matter where you are in your stage of studying the Bible, we're trying to help
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.840]   you to learn how to do the study for yourself.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.680]   And so as we do that, again, one of the goals that we have is so that you may not be tossed
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.240]   back and forth by every wind of doctrine.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.460]   Again, if you've been a Christian for any period of time, you know that there's a lot
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.460]   of opinions.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.480]   A lot of people say different things about different texts and different theology.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.320]   We want you to be able to have a good enough grasp of the Word of God for yourself that
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.800]   you don't ask, you know, five years, ten years, twenty years down the line, you know, what
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.720]   does our church think about this?
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.260]   I think if you're a maturing Christian, one of the key components of being mature is that
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.560]   you have a growing grasp of what the Word of God says.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.200]   And so you will be able to discern when bad doctrine, you hear bad doctrines, that you
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.040]   don't need us to tell you that it's bad, that the Word that you know will be able to guide
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.600]   you through that.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.680]   Thirdly, we want you to be able to make applications in your life based upon the proper understanding
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   of the text.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.160]   So again, where Christianity is being practiced unbiblically is because they don't know what
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.880]   the Bible says.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.320]   So we want the sanctification that you and I are striving for to come from a careful
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.100]   study of the Word of God.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.120]   And then fourthly, to be able to teach other people how to study the Bible.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.240]   So if you've been a Christian here at our church for two years, three years, five years,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.280]   that we're hoping that you'll be equipped enough to be able to teach other people also.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.120]   But not only that, as you and I know, we live in a biblical, illiterate, not only world,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.420]   but even the Christian world, where the Word of God is not highly valued in our generation.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.360]   So we want you to be able to be a light within the light.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.280]   We want you to be able to be the light where you can even guide other people in saying,
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.920]   "Well, this is what the Word of God says."
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.520]   And to be able to point to Scripture instead of discussing the Bible.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.880]   Now in the priority of how we study the Bible, first of all, again, this is something that
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.320]   I try to go through every time I teach the Bible, because I want our church to understand
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.080]   the priority of the exegesis.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.060]   Exegesis basically is the verse by verse, chapter by chapter, book by book study through
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.080]   the whole Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.580]   And to ask the question, to actually study the Word of God, right?
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.260]   Not just skim through it.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.740]   And so that's our priority.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.740]   And that's what inductive Bible study basically is.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.640]   It is the exegesis of the Bible.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.400]   And that has to be at the foundation of everything that we do.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.980]   Verse by verse study of the Word of God.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.180]   Now if we have enough grasp of the different texts in the Bible, we have systematic theology.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.300]   The systematic theology is a collection of our understanding of different parts of the
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.660]   Bible and to be able to ask the question, not just what does this text say, but what
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.540]   does the Bible say about this subject?
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.900]   So the best example of that would be the doctrine of Trinity.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.020]   The Trinity is not taught in one particular text.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.620]   It's a collection of things that Jesus said, things that are stated in the Old Testament,
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.060]   things that are stated about God, things that Jesus says about God.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.420]   And so when you collectively put that together, it teaches the doctrine of Trinity.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.560]   And so in a nutshell, that's what systematic theology is.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.180]   What does the Bible teach about the end time?
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.780]   What does the Bible teach about Israel?
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.320]   What does the Bible teach about itself?
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.220]   And so that's systematic theology.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.740]   And you can't have systematic theology until you have enough exegesis.
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.180]   And then if you have systematic theology and growing, you're able to compare with historical
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.180]   theology.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.980]   Historical theology basically is what did our church fathers, what did the historical
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.100]   church believe about a particular subject?
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.660]   What did they think about the Trinity?
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.260]   What did they think about inerrancy?
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.040]   What did they think about end times?
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.980]   And so we're able to wrestle and to compare the doctrines that were passed down to us
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.480]   from generation to generation.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.700]   But when we don't have exegesis and when we don't have systematic theology, we just become
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.560]   dependent upon what other people say.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.100]   So there's a lot of people who are in the habit of coming to conclusions based upon
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.900]   books that they read.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.200]   Now reading books is better than not reading books.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.400]   But if you read books about theology without knowing the Bible itself, you end up picking
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.740]   and choosing based upon what makes sense and doesn't make sense to you.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.260]   And not necessarily through a biblical filter, but through your own filter.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.180]   But again, there's nothing wrong with historical theology, but we need to make sure that exegesis
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.360]   is where we spend most of our time.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.980]   And then that will automatically lead to systematic theology.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.980]   Then we can wrestle with historical theology.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.020]   And then we have discussions about philosophical theology.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.340]   Philosophical theology is how do we reconcile certain things that are taught in the Bible.
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.060]   If God is sovereign, like the Bible teaches, and man is responsible for his own sins, how
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.420]   do we reconcile that?
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.700]   So we already agree what the Bible says.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.380]   Philosophical theology basically is reconciling that so that it helps to make sense.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.940]   And so a lot of times sermons will help us.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.780]   So when I give sermons, I try to take what the Bible teaches and then try to apply that
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.140]   in a way that makes more sense to us.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.940]   So that's where philosophical theology is.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.900]   But if we are not careful, we can make philosophical theology our priority, where we have a lot
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.200]   of discussions about what makes sense and doesn't make sense.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.540]   So when people say about certain issues that are going on, saying like, "I think this is
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.540]   right.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.540]   I think this is wrong."
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.260]   But it's not based upon Scripture.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.020]   It's based upon what they think the Scripture says, but not necessarily based on Scripture.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.660]   And so whenever we study the Bible, it needs to be in this order.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.900]   We spend most of our time in exegesis, which will lead to systematic theology.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.360]   Then we can compare with historical theology.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.540]   Then we can learn how to apply this in philosophical theology.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.220]   So again, just to kind of get our priorities in order, and this is what we're doing.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:56.220]   So the first thing that we need to do in inductive Bible study is to have a larger grasp of the
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.120]   letter itself.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.300]   So these five chapters in Thessalonians, we need to know what it says before we jump into
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:09.960]   chapter 1, verse 1, 2, and 3, because it'll kind of give us a broad outline of why he
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.500]   wrote this letter.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.900]   How does this relate to other things that he is saying?
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.060]   Who is he writing it to?
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.160]   What is the context in which he writes it?
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.980]   And so just like if you were to watch a movie, you don't jump in in the middle and try to
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.960]   figure out what the story is about.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.420]   You need to kind of have a grasp of what's going on.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.620]   Like, oh, this is about this, right?
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.060]   Anyway, I mean, you know what I'm saying.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:38.460]   You need to have a good grasp of the totality of what this letter is about.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:46.020]   So in order to do that, we want to read the letter as often and as much as you can.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.400]   So some of you can understand it quickly.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.620]   You can read maybe once or twice and get a broad outline.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.300]   And so you can see how the thoughts are connected.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.300]   I think for most of us, you need to read it at least three or four times and you kind
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.660]   of get an idea on the flow.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.220]   How does chapter 1, the argument he's making 1, how does that connect to chapter 4?
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.760]   And so in order to do that, we want to start out by giving an outline.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.500]   So read about two or three times and then possibly on the fourth time, start to outline.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.100]   And so this is what I do.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.180]   So I would say from verses 1 through 5, and I'm just going to write it over here, would
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:38.100]   be obviously the introduction of Paul's ministry.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:50.580]   Then I would say 6 through 10 would be the response
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:56.440]   of the gospel by the Thessalonians.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:03.060]   And then we get to chapter 2 and I would say probably chapter 2, 1 through 12.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.740]   So just a large outline.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:26.500]   And I would say Paul's defense of his gospel ministry.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:53.620]   And then I would say verses 13 through 16 would be response in opposition to the gospel.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.780]   You don't need to write it the way I write it, but this is just to kind of give you an
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.140]   example what to do in these five chapters.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:07.220]   It doesn't have to be verse 1 and 2, 4 to 6, and 8 to 9, but you can just broad outline
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.740]   so to kind of give you a good grasp of what's going on in each chapter.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.800]   So I'm not going to do it for all five chapters, but again, I'm asking you that you would take
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.900]   some time to do that this week before you come to Bible study next week.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:27.340]   And so the goal of it is that first of all that you would answer the who, what, why,
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.620]   how, where, when of this letter.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.660]   And who wrote it.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.100]   Obviously Paul says in the beginning, Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, they wrote the letter.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.740]   Well, who did they write it to?
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.940]   Were they the Jewish community?
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.300]   Was it a Christian community?
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.300]   Were they believers?
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   Were they elders?
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   The congregation?
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.420]   Who did they write it to?
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.740]   Why did they write it?
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.300]   Why did he write it?
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.780]   Where was this letter written?
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.420]   When was it written?
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.060]   And so we want to try to answer this as much as possible.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:03.500]   And then once you've done that, you can ask big questions of what is the major theme?
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.780]   Is it about the gospel?
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.100]   Is it about church life?
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.860]   Is it about end times?
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.460]   What are some major themes?
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.460]   Try to find about two or three of them if you can.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.620]   What are some repeated phrases?
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.100]   And I've already written some of it.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.220]   The term gospel comes out quite a few in this letter.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.220]   And what do you think is a key verse in this letter?
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.420]   One particular verse that if you memorize that, it'll kind of give you a good grasp
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.540]   of what this letter says.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.660]   So you don't want that to be more than one or two verses.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.940]   It's just to kind of help you understand the theme so that next time that verse comes up,
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.240]   you kind of have some idea of the outline and what Paul is talking about.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.660]   And then finally, to come up with your own title.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.220]   And that kind of captures the purpose of this letter.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.260]   So it could be the model church.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.220]   It could be the boldness in the gospel, love, faith, and hope.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.700]   So whatever it may be.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:08.960]   And again, all of this is a background study so that you yourself can have some understanding
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.140]   of the letter before we actually jump into the specific verses.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.180]   And so for your assignment would be before you even get into your small group, before
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.820]   we do, I do my introduction.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.580]   So if you come prepared for this, I think you'll be able to get more out of it.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.580]   Okay.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.580]   All right.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.860]   [End of Audio]
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.620]   (laughs)
