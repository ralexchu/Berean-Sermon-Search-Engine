[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   Hello, my name is Lauren.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.400]   I'm currently a third year public health science at UCI and this is my testimony.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.200]   So unlike many of my peers, I never grew up in a church, nor did I grow up in a Christian
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.200]   household.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.080]   The earliest memory I have of church was attending it with my grandparents here and there when
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.080]   I was younger.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.960]   But after entering elementary school, I stopped going.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.680]   Growing up, I was what you called a good kid.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.640]   Never got in trouble by my teachers, obeyed my two loving and caring parents, didn't attend
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.000]   parties or intake alcohol or drugs, had a close group of friends that all got along
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.120]   well with each other, anything the world would see as ideal.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.480]   However, in my senior year of high school, I began to be involved in different dating
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.480]   relationships.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.280]   Even though I had all that I could ask for, I still felt a void in my heart and struggled
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.600]   at finding my purpose and identity.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.040]   Although my closest friend introduced me to her home church in senior year, I was still
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.360]   confused at who God was and who I was.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.040]   My struggle at trying to please man, especially my boyfriends, and deem worthy to those around
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.040]   me.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.400]   I tried filling the void with dating relationships in school, but because of that, it brought
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.640]   upon a lot of scars and pains.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.560]   Coming into university, I never planned on being involved with church or Christ.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.160]   I wanted to indulge in the world by attending parties and seeking freedom now that I was
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.600]   away from my family.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.880]   However, in his grace, God had other plans for me.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.880]   I was introduced to Berean Community Church by alumni from my high school.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.440]   Many of you may know him as Eugene.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.800]   I was drawn in by how welcoming the community was and the passion Pastor Peter had for the
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   word.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.440]   Before I realized, I was involved in small group, Friday Bible study, Sunday service,
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.640]   and campus ministry.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.600]   I heard the gospel for the first time during small group my freshman year of college.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.640]   For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.560]   him shall not perish but have eternal life, John 3:16.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.120]   Through church, small group, and campus ministry, I was beginning to understand who God was
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.920]   and the consequences of sin.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.440]   My faith wasn't tested until I was away from church for the summer my freshman year.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.480]   By experiencing various trials, I saw that my knowledge of the Lord was all head and
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.920]   no heart.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.120]   I tried to convert those around me into Christianity and change their hearts through my own works
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.680]   and actions but was only faced with constant criticism and rejection.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.400]   I began to question my salvation and faith in the Lord.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.960]   One day I shut myself in a closet and for the first time prayed vulnerably and honestly
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.120]   to the Lord.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.600]   I surrendered my everything to him and truly declared him as my Lord and Savior.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:05.220]   An overwhelming sense of peace flooded in my heart as I knew that no work or worth could
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.960]   ever earn his love.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.080]   Someone so insignificant and sinful as myself is deeply known and deeply loved by the Lord
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   my Father.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.400]   as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus who God put forward as appropriation
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.640]   by his blood to be received by faith, Romans 3, 23 to 25.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.800]   God continues to write my story.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.400]   I am far from perfect and I struggle with sin daily but I know that he is working in
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.240]   me and renewing me.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.120]   I am blessed to be surrounded by communities of brothers and sisters that encourage and
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.680]   sharpen me and as Pastor Nate likes to say, "Once saved, always persevere."
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.160]   I am no longer a slave to that through sin but redeemed and adopted into his kingdom.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.200]   Truly this life is no longer mine to live but Christ who lives in me.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   Thank you.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   [Applause]
