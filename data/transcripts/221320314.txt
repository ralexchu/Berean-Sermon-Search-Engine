[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.040]   And so, what we're seeing now with the heavens open and with the glimpse of the lion and
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.320]   the slain lamb and how that's being worshipped and all these other things, the seven horns,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.780]   seven eyes, all of these things are actual, like visual presentations of specific doctrines
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.760]   and specific redemptive acts that you and I probably already know, but you get a visual
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.540]   of basically the gospel, right?
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.360]   That's what we're looking at today.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.880]   Yes, last week we looked at the first two scenes, right?
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.880]   The third scene is a scene of the sealed scroll.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.600]   And so, what I want you guys to see, the scroll contains a promise of fulfillment of redemption
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.680]   of mankind, and that's basically what you're going to see being played out in chapter five.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.720]   So if you were to visualize redemption, and again, obviously this picture doesn't capture
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.480]   every nuance and every aspect of the gospel, but if you were to picture God humbling himself
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.240]   and becoming a man to be sent as a sacrifice for our sins, the way the Bible describes
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.520]   it is as the lion of Judah becoming as a slain lamb, and that's how it's visually presented
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.520]   to us.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.040]   And obviously that's clear, the gospel message, right?
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.240]   It says that the scroll was in God's right hand, signifying his control and authority,
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.100]   that God has the final say over all of this.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.040]   And part of the reason why they can't open up the seal is because God's the one who put
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.180]   the seal on this.
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.160]   So not anybody can open this up.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.900]   No creature can just come and open this up.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.200]   It says that there's writings inside, and basically it's full, signifying the completeness
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.360]   that you can't add to it or take away from it because the scroll is already full.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   It is complete.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.240]   There's nothing more to be written, right?
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.300]   So everything that is going to say, everything that is going to happen, it is already written.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.740]   There's nothing that's going to change, and that's what it signifies when the scroll is
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.620]   full front and back, right?
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.660]   I'm not going to go through all the passages, but in Ezekiel 3.10, in Psalm 139.16, Isaiah
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.260]   29, Daniel 8, they all have this very similar vision where they see...
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.080]   I'll just read Ezekiel 3.10, it says, "And he spread it before me, and it had writing
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.260]   on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.260]   and woe."
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.260]   So you see in all these various passages where there is a description of the drama of redemption
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.140]   being played out, and it says that all of this was already recorded, right?
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.220]   That this was not just some God looking down history and figuring out, okay, maybe they're
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.700]   going to do this, and he just happens to be a really good fortune teller.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.140]   He says the reason why it's written is because God has already determined it, and it is full
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.340]   inside and out, so nothing's going to be changed.
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.980]   So everything that is written in it will take place.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.080]   It says, "It is sealed up with the seven seals, signifying that the words can only be released
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.900]   by someone who has authority."
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.540]   Typically, in the Roman culture, if something was extremely important, it was required by
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.740]   law to have at least seven witnesses, right?
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.340]   The Bible asks for two or three witnesses, but again, in the Roman, when it was something
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.580]   very significant, there had to be seven witnesses to testify.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.220]   So it may be playing off of that idea, possibly, but again, in the Bible, the number seven
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.580]   obviously is a representative of something complete, final, and typically we say that
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.660]   that's the number of God, 777.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.300]   So when it says that there are seven seals, it signifies that God is the one who has the
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.520]   authority, and God's the one who shut it, right?
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.980]   So therefore, no one can come and just open it up.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.540]   In verse 2 and 4, if you read it, it's John's response to what's going on, and he says,
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.120]   "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, 'Who is worthy to open the
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.580]   scroll and break its seal?' and no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.220]   able to open the scroll or look into it, and I began to weep loudly because no one was
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.580]   found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it."
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:54.220]   So if verse 1 is a description of the scroll and that God's redemptive plan, in order
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.760]   for that to be opened up, somebody who had to be worthy had to come and open it up.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.280]   So in verse 2, it describes who can open it up, right?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.920]   And so the first thing that I thought about when I saw that scene is when you're in a
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.460]   marriage ceremony, I don't typically do that, and I have my own reasons why I don't do that,
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.040]   but you've probably been to a wedding where the officiant would ask, "Who gives away the
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   bride?"
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040]   Right?
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.840]   Now, nobody in there is like, "Well, I don't know.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   You giving it away?"
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.000]   You know, everybody knows who that is.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.940]   You're just role-playing, right?
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.020]   And the purpose of doing that is to proclaim that the two families have come together and
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.020]   they have the blessing.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.520]   And so, of course, if you didn't bless them, they wouldn't be there.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.500]   You spent all that money and preparation for all of that.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.040]   But they go through that drama to basically say, publicly proclaim, to act out, to leave
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.800]   and cleave.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.320]   The father says, "I," you know, "whoever is giving away this bride," and then you would
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   act that out.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.240]   So, that's what it reminds me of in verse 2 when it says, "Who is worthy?"
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.360]   It's almost kind of like a setup to point to Christ, right?
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.280]   And then they kind of act out like, well, they went and searched everywhere.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.560]   Like did they really not know?
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   You know?
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   I think this was the setup.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   It's kind of like, "Who is worthy?"
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   And so, they looked everywhere, heaven and earth, and no one could find anybody worthy.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.720]   And then we find John weeping because no one was able to open it up.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.080]   I mean, John already knew what it would mean if that thing could not be opened up because
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.280]   salvation of mankind, right?
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.960]   Names of those who are written in heaven are all probably written maybe in this scroll.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.320]   And if you can't open it up, it means condemnation for the world.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.200]   So, again, I already mentioned that.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:56.080]   So in this gospel drama, verses 2 and 4 is a description of the hopelessness of mankind.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.760]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, right?
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.280]   So verse 1 is the setup.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.720]   2, 3, and 4 is kind of like the book of Romans, verses 1, chapter 1, 2, and 3.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.960]   Everything Paul says in the book of Romans leads up to all have sinned and fall short
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   of the glory of God.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:20.040]   So, in this gospel drama, we end with John weeping because there was nobody worthy.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   Who can save us?
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.200]   Who was, "Oh, what a wretched man I am.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.640]   Who is going to save us from this body of death?"
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.960]   And that's kind of like John's weeping in this text.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:49.480]   So these four verses is the natural response of all mankind, represented by John's weeping.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.160]   Scene 4.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.040]   Scene 4, Jesus is proclaimed as the Lion of Judah, signifying the rightful kingship over
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.600]   Israel.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.000]   So we talked about that last week, like when you think of the lion, what does it symbolize?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.440]   Strength, right?
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   Kingship.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:14.760]   And so when we say the elders come along, and in verse 5 it says, "And one of the elders
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.520]   said to me, 'Weep no more.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.960]   Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered so that he can
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.840]   open the scroll and its seven scales.'"
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.200]   So the next scene is the elder comforting John.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.880]   The Lion of Judah, meaning Christ who fulfills the prophecy that he comes in the lineage
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.360]   of David, the Lion of Judah, he has conquered.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.920]   It doesn't explain here how he conquered, what he conquered, obviously you and I know
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.000]   what that means.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.640]   But he says, "That person that you've been looking for heaven and earth and under the
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.960]   earth that you couldn't find, there he is, the Lion of Judah."
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.880]   And so what happens?
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:01.000]   He's the only one who was able to conquer.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.040]   And when he points, and again, this is probably one of my favorite passages in the Bible,
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.480]   because of the imagery.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.560]   He says, "The Lion of Judah has come," and then in verse 6, "And between the throne and
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.480]   the four living creatures among the elders, I saw a lamb standing as though he has been
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.480]   slain."
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.240]   So he said, "The Lion of Judah, the King has come."
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:32.760]   So the elders proclaim that this scroll that no one can open, the Lion of Judah, the King,
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.140]   the conqueror has come, and he conquered.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.680]   And then when they turn around, obviously you would think that they're looking for a
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.080]   king, right?
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.880]   They're looking for something mighty.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.200]   And that's exactly what the Jews were looking for.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.680]   They were looking for a Messiah to come riding on a horse and basically slaughter the Romans
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.600]   and put them back in their place.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   When they turn around, what do they see?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:03.200]   They see lambs, not just any lamb, a lamb that's been offered for sacrifice.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:12.360]   And it says it has seven horns and seven eyes, symbolizing complete omnipotence and omniscience.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:18.800]   I don't think I left that portion blank for you.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.000]   And the horn typically in the scriptures and at that time represented power because that's
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.560]   what the rams would typically use for its strength.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.040]   So when the Bible uses the term horns, it often represents authority or power.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.120]   The fact that it has seven horns and seven eyes represents its omnipotence and omniscience,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.280]   to know all and basically who is that a description of?
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.040]   Who's omniscient, who's omnipotent?
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.860]   Only one being, God himself.
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.400]   So this lamb of God, he says this lion of Judah who's going to come and conquer and
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.840]   open the scroll that no one else can open, turn around, they see the lamb of God who
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.040]   is God himself, right?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.200]   Who's slain.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:22.320]   Those of you guys who, I know very few of you read the book, Darkness and the Glory.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.800]   I think some of us read through it and then we went through the, during the small group
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.040]   time.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:37.880]   But in that book, Dr. Harris describes basically the cross from every different angle.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:44.120]   He describes the cross from Christ on the cross looking out and he quotes Psalm and
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.540]   it's Jesus himself saying, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.920]   He describes the cross from the Father's view, right?
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.380]   And he goes through passages in the Old Testament where the Father is speaking of his Son.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:01.680]   He describes the cross from a demonic point of view, like what the demonics saw.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.500]   He describes the cross from the disciples' view.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:13.920]   He describes the view from the other thieves that were hanging on the cross next to him.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.000]   So he describes the cross, basically what he does is he takes every single angle that
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.840]   the Bible gives in every perspective, from the top, from the bottom, from the side, and
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:31.440]   he basically systematically puts all these views together so that you would not only
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.400]   get it from our point of view as people who have been redeemed 2,000 years later, human
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.340]   beings removed from the culture, and like what does the cross look like to us?
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.240]   But he gives us a complete picture of the cross, right?
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.760]   It's a little bit difficult to read because his paragraphs aren't clear, but once you
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.440]   really understand what he's doing, I mean, I've never read a book that actually is that
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.480]   thorough in perspective of what's happening on the cross.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:07.800]   And one of the things that always intrigued me about that book was how he described, again,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.200]   this is not just his imagination, he would go to these scriptures and he said, "Imagine
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   what that would have looked like from the angel's point of view."
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.000]   The angel's point of view.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.840]   And obviously even the demonic point of view, this is a God that created them and that they
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:33.600]   worshipped, they served, and now he's beaten and he's naked and he's hanging upon the cross
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:40.640]   and he actually, who was the creator of the world, completely helpless, and the sin of
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.600]   mankind is hanging upon him, that what they must have seen and how strange of a sight
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.360]   that must have been for them, right?
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.520]   So I always think about that, I was thinking like, yeah, I can imagine what that would
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.320]   have looked like, but imagine what that would have been like for the angels.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.160]   It would have been mind-blowing, like what is going on?
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.080]   And I think of this picture of the elders coming and saying, "The Lion of Judah has
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.640]   come and conquered, so do not weep."
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.720]   And they turn around, they see a slain lamb.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.800]   Now we imagine it in our head, but imagine who that is that's slain.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.240]   That same God that these angels and creatures and elders have been worshipping now is just
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.520]   lying there limp and without power, right?
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:37.200]   I mean, I think that's the power of the imagery of what is being presented to us in chapter
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   five.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.060]   It's one thing to describe it with our words, another thing to be able to see that visually,
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:47.180]   and that's what John is describing, right?
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.200]   So the lion comes as a slain lamb.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.720]   And again, in Isaiah 53, 7, it says, "He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.760]   opened not his mouth like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like sheep that before
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.720]   its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth."
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:12.340]   And that's how Christ and his redemption plan is described for us in Isaiah 53.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.220]   Scene five.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.700]   Scene five, six, and seven is a reaction to this redemption, right?
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.700]   So scene one is the throne of God.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.360]   Scene two is the creatures and the elders bowing down in worship.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:32.700]   Scene three is the scroll that contains life and redemption, that no one can open it up.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:39.980]   Scene four is the pointing of the slain lamb who shows up and he conquers.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.180]   And then scene five, six, and seven is a response to that.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:50.740]   So collectively, all seven scenes is the total collection of the gospel from beginning to
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.260]   the end, from God to the final scene.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:05.420]   So starting from scene five, it begins with the worship of the creatures and the elders.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:16.820]   In light of what the lamb of God does, they fall down and they worship the lamb.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:22.500]   The word for worship in the Greek, the most common word, there's about nine different
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.420]   words and three most prominent, and out of the three, the word that is used more than
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:37.860]   any other word is the word proskuneo, and literally just means to fall down or bow down.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:43.540]   True worship in scripture is always described as a reaction.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.100]   It's always described as a reaction in the presence of something magnificent, something
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.500]   bigger and awesome.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:56.020]   And you can't help but to bow down and worship.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:03.500]   So whether you travel and you see this beautiful scenery and it just causes you to say, "Wow."
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.940]   Or somebody's performing on stage and maybe a cello solo or pianist or somebody who's
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:15.020]   singing and they're just so good at what they do, and in the presence of that, you just
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.660]   look at it in awe and say, "Wow."
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.140]   That was really good.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.620]   Or the NBA finals going on and one of the players are out there and he's doing ridiculous
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.020]   shot after shot and at the end, it's like, "Wow."
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.600]   You're just floored like, "Wow, he can do that."
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:40.680]   So the Bible always describes genuine worship as a reaction when you're confronted by the
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.060]   almighty God.
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.900]   That's why I think it's extremely important.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.340]   It doesn't matter how hard you work.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.900]   It doesn't matter how often you come to church or maybe even, you're doing all the right
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.660]   things.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:02.900]   But if you're not encountering God, your worship is just you trying your best to be a good
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:08.940]   person.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.700]   If we're not encountering God in our life and in our public life or whatever, if you're
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.940]   not encountering God, every good thing that you're trying to do is you trying to muster
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.860]   up enough strength to be a good person.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:26.460]   But real worship happens as a result of encountering God.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.780]   So whether we're talking about prayer, whether we're talking about obedience, or whether
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:37.300]   we're talking about quiet time or Bible study or Sunday worship, that the end goal for all
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.420]   of that is to encounter God.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:48.140]   But if you're not encountering God, maybe because that's not your goal, it's just to
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.140]   do it.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.500]   Sunday you're supposed to, so you do it.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.860]   You're supposed to pray, so you do it.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.380]   You're supposed to read, so you do it.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.900]   But you're not really digging to know God.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.100]   You're not digging to encounter God.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:04.620]   Then no matter how much we try to muster up genuine worship, you're not awed by anything.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:10.380]   If you're not being awed by the glory of God and the various things that we learn about
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:17.220]   God, then again, worship is just us trying harder.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:25.180]   So you look at the response of what happens is in light of the Lamb of God who sees, right,
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.580]   Lamb of God who conquers, who's able to open this up, it breaks out into this worship.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.260]   So what we're seeing here is just a natural response.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.380]   It starts with the creatures and then every time, remember we talked about that last week,
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.660]   the creatures seem like the worship choir directors.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.780]   They're the ones who first initiate worship and it says that every time they initiate
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.240]   worship that the elders bow down and worship, right?
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.260]   And they hold harps and golden bowls which represents prayer and singing.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:01.300]   And so again, the description in the rest of the verses is basically a worship scene.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.540]   It's a corporate worship taking place because of what Christ has done.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.420]   And then in the new song, they break out and then they break out a new song which symbolizes
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   newness.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:18.380]   Isaiah prophesies about this new order, the new world that he's going to bring as a result
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.460]   of this redemptive work.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.020]   And so that language of newness is all over Revelations.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.940]   We're going to be given a new name.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.780]   There's going to be a new Jerusalem, new heaven and new earth and all things will be made
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.780]   new.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:39.980]   And so here again, the end result of redemptive plan is all things are made new, right?
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:46.220]   And so in this heavenly scene, they're breaking out into this new song because of what the
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:52.340]   slain lamb has done or is going to do, is going to make all things new.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:21:00.180]   And again, the content of this drama is redemption.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.940]   In verse 9, it says, "And they sang a new song and it says, 'Worthy are you to take
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.860]   the scroll and to open its seal, for you were slain and by your blood you ransomed people
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.540]   for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.620]   And you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God and they shall reign on the earth.'"
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:31.260]   Sixth scene, the creatures begin to worship, the elders bow down on worship, and then the
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.620]   next verses 11 and 12, the angels, they chime in.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.900]   So it kind of has this chain reaction of worship.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.500]   It begins with those who are the closest to the throne of God, to the lamb, and then the
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.220]   next outer circle is the elders.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.580]   And then after the elders, it kind of has a chain effect.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:55.740]   And all the angels up in heaven, it says, "Myriads and myriads, thousands upon thousands."
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.940]   It almost kind of has an anticlimactic thing, it's like myriads and myriads, and then you
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:03.420]   would hear billions of billions, and you'd say thousands of thousands.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.100]   So in my mind, myriads and myriads is much bigger than thousands and thousands.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.220]   But again, whenever you see the scripture recite something in multiplication of the
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:19.900]   same number, it basically means an uncounted amount.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.900]   So it doesn't necessarily mean 1,000 times 1,000.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.740]   That's the way that they would express something that was uncountable.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:34.560]   You may have thousands upon thousands or tens upon tens or whatever number is being repeated
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.140]   and being multiplied, it means that there is, it's a number that you can't count.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.060]   So we're not supposed to read that and say, "Well, 1,000 and 1,000."
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.540]   So myriad sounds like a lot more number.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:54.740]   So basically what they're saying is all the created angels basically respond in worship
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.620]   as a result of what Christ has done.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:04.420]   So the picture that we see in heaven of the throne of God is these creatures and the elders
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:10.140]   are 24/7 crying out, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty."
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:15.700]   And then the picture that results from the redemptive plan and what Christ has done is
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.300]   also the creatures and the elders bow down and worship.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.100]   And then now it has a ripple effect among the angels, and the angels are crying out
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.380]   and worshiping.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.100]   And the angels represent the congregation in heaven.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.420]   So you kind of see a corporate picture of heaven.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.100]   So when people talk about, "What am I going to be doing in heaven?"
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:39.420]   We're going to be joining them in chorus.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:45.060]   If you've tasted the sweetness of true worship before God, that's something that I believe
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.300]   that you're going to look forward to.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:55.660]   If you've ever experienced ecstasy in the context of really worshiping God, where all
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:01.740]   of your problems, kind of like Job, in the midst of all of his suffering, that God shows
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.280]   up and all he does is shows up.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.900]   And in the context of seeing his glory, he says, "Now I have seen everything."
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.660]   And he's satisfied, "I can die."
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.340]   There's no explanation of why he suffered.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.740]   There's no answer to his life.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.620]   God just shows up and he sees his glory, and then all of a sudden everything's good.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:30.380]   If you've ever experienced true worship, not attended some conference or heard a good
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:40.260]   message, but worship where you lose yourself, where you sense his glory or you get a glimpse
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.940]   of his glory and there's nothing like it.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.980]   You see something that you can't possibly explain.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:55.780]   And so if you've ever truly experienced that, you might look at this and say, "Wow, I get
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.700]   to be in the part of this.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.580]   I get to worship God close up with these angels."
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:08.060]   If you've never experienced that and you don't understand what I'm saying, you've just seen
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:15.780]   God from a distance and you like God, he's important to you, but you've never experienced
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:22.460]   this true worship, then this is going to be a very strange scene for you.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.100]   To go to heaven and what are we going to be doing in heaven for eternity?
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.100]   This is what you're seeing.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.180]   This is what God is inviting us to do.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:37.380]   The author of life is at the center and all of creation is coming to worship.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:42.500]   And it's declaring the same glory that was attributed to God the Father, all glory, honor,
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.140]   and power belongs to the Lamb of God.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.140]   Worship of the Father, worship of the Son.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:26:04.100]   And then the final scene, all created things in verse 13, "And I heard every creature in
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.340]   heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them saying,
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.980]   to him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.260]   forever and ever."
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:22.220]   So in other words, every description here in verse 13 is a description of everything.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:27.780]   Everything that is not in rebellion against God is going to be worshiping God.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:35.420]   So at the end, before he comes and he redeems his church, he's going to first come to purify
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.980]   his creation.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:44.100]   All that is going to be burned up in judgment is going to be judged.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.940]   And only things that are going to be remaining are those who are going to remain in eternity
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:54.020]   in worship of God and his Son.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.100]   And that's what the Holy Spirit is leading us to.
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.280]   That's the final scene.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:04.100]   So whether you're a pre-trib, post-trib, amillennial, premillennial, postmillennial, whatever millennial
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.300]   and tribulation view that you may have, one thing that we all agree is Christ is going
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:13.660]   to come and there's going to be a white throne judgment and what we're going to see in chapter
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:20.740]   6, 7, 8, all the way to chapter 16 is that now he's going to start to break the seal.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:26.020]   And with every seal that he breaks, he's going to come and with every judgment that he brings,
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:31.220]   he's purifying the world of all the rebellion.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:36.380]   And at the end of these judgments, what's going to come is those who are going to remain
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.740]   to worship.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.960]   What was lost at the fall.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.020]   God created us to be his image bearers for the purpose of worshiping God.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:48.340]   But when Adam and Eve decided to rebel against him and sought their own glory instead of
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.600]   glorifying God, they died.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.980]   And so that is what's being restored in redemption, is to restore creatures who are created for
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:03.740]   the purpose of worship to be recreated for the purpose of worship.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.900]   And so that's the scene that we see.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:14.060]   And it's the same, again, same praise and honor that is given to God the Father is given
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:19.420]   to the Lamb.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:26.140]   So we saw in the beginning this drama start with the creatures, the elders, and so it
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:34.180]   is fitting that it ends also with the creatures and the elders and they cry out, "Amen,"
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:42.660]   meaning we affirm.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:47.980]   So starting from next week, we're going to see each of the seals being broken.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:53.020]   The Lamb of God, this redemption that the plan that he has, he's going to begin because
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.760]   he is worthy now, because of what he has done, he's able to break these seals and eat, which
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.240]   every single one of these seals that he breaks, there's going to be a rightful judgment that's
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.300]   going to come upon the world.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:10.180]   So the question that we debated, we started out with is, is the church going to be going
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.340]   through this tribulation or is this something that we're going to be safe from?
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:19.320]   And I told you that my personal view is I believe that we are going to be sustained
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.940]   through the tribulation, meaning that the church and the world is going to be set on
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:31.860]   fire, meaning with persecutions and trials and famine and those who persevere to the
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.940]   end, those who make it to the end, it says they will be saved because their faith is
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.100]   going to be tested.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:44.940]   And I think every single Christian, even today, even though we may not have a knife or a gun
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.820]   or a bomb threatening that if you come to church you're going to die, your family's
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:55.380]   going to suffer, I think every single Christian in one way or another, your faith is tested.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.420]   You're being tested today.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.900]   You may be aware of it, may not be aware of it.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:08.380]   Where your heart is, the idols that you worship, sometimes the test that comes where you choose
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:15.300]   God today or you're going to deny God, sometimes those type of trials are very clear, like
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.740]   you do this and you don't do this, but some of the hardest trials and testing that comes
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.940]   into our lives are the ones that you don't even realize it's a trial.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.740]   You don't realize that your faith is being tested, right?
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.460]   Your faith is being tested with riches.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:40.420]   Your faith is being tested with temptation, of possibility of future, fear of not having
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:46.300]   if you are too serious about God, making certain decisions that's going to cause you to move
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.700]   away from comfort.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.320]   Your faith is being tested.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.460]   You may not be aware of it.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.620]   Maybe you are aware of it.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.760]   But every single one of us, every single Christian, there is no Christian where the faith is not
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.760]   tested.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.380]   In fact, the ones who don't recognize the testing is probably you're the one in the
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.620]   greatest danger.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:11.980]   And the end result of it is those through the testing, whether you are poor or rich,
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:17.820]   whether you are in danger or you are living in comfort, the end result is will you worship
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.700]   God?
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.700]   Will you worship God in trials?
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.820]   In fact, a lot of Christians worship God better when they're under trial.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.280]   Will you worship God in peace?
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.620]   Will you worship God when you're out on missions?
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.300]   Will you worship God when you're at home?
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.060]   Will you worship God when you're surrounded by encouragement?
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.140]   Will you worship God when you are the only one standing?
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.500]   Will you worship God when you have money?
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.580]   Will you worship God when you don't have money?
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:48.180]   Will you worship God when you have opportunities or don't have opportunities?
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:53.660]   All of these things will test to see are you a worshiper who are worshipping in spirit
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.660]   and in truth?
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.540]   Because again, at the end, the purpose of redemption is to take us and join this scene,
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.660]   this heavenly scene of worship.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:07.940]   We're just seeing a drama presentation of it, but in the end, this is where we're headed.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:14.060]   Let me go over some of the discussion questions with you.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.820]   What was the most sacrificial thing that someone has ever done?
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.860]   I'm not talking about outside of God and outside of your parents.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:27.980]   What is one thing that you can remember that somebody did for you that was the most sacrificial?
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.780]   I'm not talking about the greatest gift.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.460]   I'm not talking about the most expensive gift.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.460]   I'm talking about the most sacrificial thing someone has done for you.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:42.700]   Take a few minutes to think about that and share it with the group.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:47.340]   If you can think of something, how did that affect you and how did that affect your relationship
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.540]   with that person?
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.680]   Number two, when was the last time you responded to the revelation of God and what he has done
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.180]   in true worship?
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.380]   Or not, "Hmm, that's good.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.220]   I should feel this way."
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:09.100]   But really, when you found something about God and what he has done and just couldn't
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.700]   help but to praise God.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.700]   When was the last time you remember where you worshiped God in that way and how did
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.700]   that affect you?
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:23.220]   Number three, do you typically see Jesus as a lion or as a lamb?
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.660]   I'm only giving you those two choices because that's how it's presented to us today.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.940]   Typically what is the picture of Christ that you have?
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.680]   Is he hanging on the cross?
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.180]   Do you typically see him on his knees washing his disciples' feet?
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.780]   Do you see him walking on water?
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.420]   What is the picture when you think of Christ?
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.420]   What do you see?
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:46.140]   And how does your view picture of him, how does that affect your worship?
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.540]   And then four, take some time to discuss again.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.380]   This is one of the questions I think I gave last week was, what practical thing you can
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.780]   do to enrich your corporate and private worship of our God?
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.780]   Okay?
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.900]   All right, so let me pray for us and then I'll let you guys get into your groups and
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:07.980]   take some time to discuss these questions.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.380]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for Christ.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.380]   We thank you for what he has done.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:23.460]   We thank you for the image that you've implanted, Lord God, through your word that we can visually
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:32.460]   see how the lion of Judah became a lamb who was slain, that we may have life eternity,
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.220]   Lord God, in you.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:40.620]   I pray that this truth would never become dull and old.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.740]   I pray, Father God, that you would renew and cause us to remember not just the details
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:55.860]   of what has happened, but that this was sacrifice that was given for me, for my sins, so that
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:03.660]   I may live, that you would renew us again, Father God, to worship as all creation worships
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.660]   you.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.300]   Help us, Lord God, to join them in worship, that you may receive the honor that you are
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.700]   do. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.
