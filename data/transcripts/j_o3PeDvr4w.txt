[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.680]   and that we are abiding by the Spirit,
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.980]   that we are nourished by your word,
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.820]   and God, that we are close, Lord, to your heart.

[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.700]   including the sharing and the preparation and more,
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.340]   would all put into investment, God,
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.260]   that we would experience those things.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.740]   That God, by the joining together of our hearts
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.180]   through your word, talking to each other
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.420]   about our applications, that it would bear its fruit in us
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.420]   abiding in Christ.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.000]   We want to thank you and praise you for all that you give us,

[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.400]   fills our mind, so that, Lord, we have both energy
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.680]   for each day, but what's more, we are bearing fruit

[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.600]   - Everyone, those of you guys who are in the room,
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.680]   please go ahead and come on out.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:55.880]   We'll go ahead and get started with covering our passage here.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:03.480]   Let's take a moment.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:08.200]   I just want to-- let's see, as people get situated here.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:12.840]   I know that when we go over the smaller portions of scripture
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.240]   and then even going through this letter,
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.760]   there's going to be a feeling of, oh, it's
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.880]   redundant because we're going to hit the same theme.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.800]   In these times, since we're slowing down,
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.440]   I really want to encourage you to break things down
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:32.240]   into not just even one sentence at a time, but phrase by phrase
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.200]   and ask, how does it relate to each other?
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.560]   And if we can, the best thing to do
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:42.720]   is ask deeper questions so that we can go deeper into the text.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.960]   I'm going to read for us Philemon starting from verse 10
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.520]   so that we get the whole gist of the paragraph again.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.120]   And it says, "I appeal to you for my child, Anisimus,
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.480]   whom I have begotten in my imprisonment, who formerly was
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.040]   useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.820]   I have sent him back to you in person.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.640]   That is, sending my very heart, whom I wish to keep with me
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.520]   so that on your behalf he might minister to me
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.280]   in my imprisonment for the gospel.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.000]   But without your consent, I did not
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.180]   want to do anything so that your goodness would not
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:23.640]   be in effect by compulsion, but of your own free will.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.920]   For perhaps he was for this reason
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.840]   separated from you for a while, that you would have him back
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.160]   forever, no longer as a slave, but more than a slave,
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.280]   a beloved brother, especially to me, but now--
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.400]   but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.200]   Let's take a quick minute to go before God
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.000]   and ask for his blessing.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.840]   Lord, as we study this book and any book
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.860]   that we do here at church, one of the things
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:57.520]   we want to pray for, God, is retention and remembrance
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.000]   of your truth.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.560]   God, we-- in one day, we read it several times,
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.760]   we talk about it, then we hear a sermon about it,
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.000]   and then we go to try to apply it.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.240]   But we know, God, that oftentimes we
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.680]   need multiple layers of being exposed to your scripture,
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.720]   but also we need the conviction of your spirit.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.680]   And so, God, we ask together that you would,
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.920]   by your spirit, teach us and continue
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.000]   to bring remembrance of what we hear as we walk each day.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.400]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.840]   Amen.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.480]   OK, so in order to do a quick review,
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.600]   I wanted to highlight and mention
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.760]   that the previous section, in the beginning,
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.160]   was the introductory remarks, identifying himself,
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.240]   identifying certain members of the church, et cetera.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.640]   But one of the earlier major portions
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.360]   was the encouragement that Apostle Paul
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.960]   was receiving from Philemon and essentially
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.800]   commending him, affirming him about his character.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   Paul was thankful for Philemon's character,
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.600]   that his character brought joy, comfort, refreshment.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.360]   And therefore, he had a level of confidence
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.040]   that his faith was already active.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.280]   And what he was shooting for, what his prayer was for,
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.160]   was that his faith would become even more effective.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.480]   That's something to consider when
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   we think about today's passage.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.360]   We're talking a lot about Philemon,
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.920]   how he needs to do this out of the volition of his heart.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.280]   Keep this in mind, that Apostle Paul
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.400]   had already an encouraged heart by what Philemon was doing.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.600]   And then from there, he wanted even more effectiveness.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.560]   And then, in verse 8 through 10, we
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.800]   had the centerpiece of this letter, where the big bulk is
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.120]   beginning to start.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.040]   Apostle Paul says, I, Paul, appeal to you
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.040]   for the sake of love.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.440]   And then he talks about how he's not going to exercise
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.240]   some of his authority.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.800]   But in that, Apostle Paul mentions
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.720]   that he is the apostle, aged and also imprisoned,
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.200]   adding great, great weight to the push.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.120]   And then, for last week, we talked about Onesimus.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.400]   And it was very moving, because man,
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:14.080]   Apostle Paul had an incredible love for Philemon.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.080]   And then he had incredible love for Onesimus.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.160]   And the kind of love that Apostle Paul had was so fatherly.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.880]   It's actually kind of--
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:27.640]   in my mind, when I was meditating on about it,
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:32.480]   I asked myself, man, do I love another grown man
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:38.440]   to this degree, to essentially say, this is my own very heart.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.240]   This is me sending you all of my affection.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.600]   That's pretty incredible.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.560]   And so he described him in that way
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.240]   and also described Onesimus as one who was useless,
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.960]   but now useful.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.840]   And he focused in on Onesimus' character,
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.680]   even though in some sense, the scripture
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.840]   doesn't say a whole lot.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.800]   Like, what did he do?
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.800]   What was he doing there when he got saved?
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.840]   And how did he treat Apostle Paul that Apostle Paul's like,
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.400]   I want you to actually stay with me,
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.680]   because you're going to help me in the kingdom work.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.480]   But nevertheless, Onesimus, one of the things
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.400]   that we came away with was, by just the fact
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.600]   that he's willing to take this massive risk
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.880]   to go present himself before his former master
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.960]   and I guess you could say current master too,
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.520]   and be at his mercy, showed an incredible level of genuineness
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.040]   in his repentance.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.640]   And I asked and posed the question to you,
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.520]   if we are ever the offending party,
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.280]   what are our obligations?
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.520]   What can we learn from this individual?
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.640]   And then so today, we hit verse 14 through 16.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.160]   And I want to walk through this with you.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.360]   He says here from the beginning, but without your consent,
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.400]   I did not want to do anything.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.800]   So I don't want to do anything that's gonna overstep this,
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.920]   your own kind of freedom, your own volition.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.560]   And so what I have here is that Apostle Paul
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.960]   exhibits a level of self restraint.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.840]   And then I'm kind of starting to think like,
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.120]   okay, so Apostle Paul's like,
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.960]   yeah, I don't want to do anything against your own,
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.560]   and then he says, so that the reason, oh no.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   That's because of my chubby hands
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.920]   that touched the wrong part.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.720]   In the beginning.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.360]   No.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.080]   This right here, this right here.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.000]   That works, okay.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.920]   He's exercising a self restraint, why?
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.920]   So here we have to realize that he exhibits his intent
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.760]   for why he's not fully going out to exercise authority,
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.720]   because the goodness that Philemon has,
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.940]   he wanted to make sure that it wasn't by compulsion,
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:00.640]   but by his own free will, okay.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.160]   That it was something derived from his own heart.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:08.560]   And then he says for, which then tells me, okay.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.520]   Now typically, when you say for,
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.120]   it's the reason why, it's because,
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.600]   and he starts to highlight, perhaps God was doing something
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.960]   that for this reason, he was separated from you
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.160]   for a little bit, that you would have him back forever.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.560]   And so what I see is this contrast of,
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.740]   yes, there was separation, but now you have him genuinely.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:34.920]   No longer a slave, but a beloved brother.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.240]   And so you have another contrast here between slave
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.560]   and the genuine beloved brother,
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.760]   which is essentially a work of God.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.140]   And so because of this work of God,
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:51.200]   Apostle Paul wants Philemon's genuine heart
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.480]   in the forgiveness, and that's why he won't go
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.400]   to exercise that authority.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.600]   And this ultimately changes the relationship
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.800]   where he says, especially to me and how much now to you,
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.680]   that he is your beloved brother, right, to me and to you.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.920]   Okay, and so by way of overview, when I read this passage,
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.880]   there's two major segments.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.680]   One, I would meditate and focus on this idea
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.880]   of your free will, okay?
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.320]   And I would want to ask all the questions that I can
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.400]   and think deeply about why is it that sometimes
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:28.160]   when we do things, it has to be derived as a source
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.680]   from my own mind and from my own purpose.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.800]   And then what's more, Apostle Paul is highlighting
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.040]   this idea that God has clearly done a work
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.600]   to change this individual, and therefore,
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:44.720]   it pushes even greater the idea you better accept him.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.800]   You should forgive him because look at the work
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.520]   that God is doing.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.280]   So let's take a moment to walk down
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.200]   and do some observation and questions
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   about this first portion in verse 14, your free will, okay?
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.080]   And I find it interesting because he does talk about,
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.800]   well, I did not want to do anything, okay?
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.640]   And that is kind of funny because the first thing
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.240]   that came to mind is like you sent a guy 1,200 miles,
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.680]   and if I was Philemon, I'd be like,
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.560]   let's say I had a heart and heart, I was like,
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.560]   what am I supposed to do with this guy?
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.480]   Send him back, you know?
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.960]   In some sense, I would almost feel like,
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.080]   do I even really have a choice here?
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.920]   What's more, Apostle Paul is sending a letter,
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.320]   he's clearly mediating, later, he's gonna say,
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.520]   by the way, I'm gonna come visit, you know?
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.840]   So it actually sounds like he's doing everything,
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.680]   so I don't know.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.320]   Now, then we have to ask the question,
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:46.920]   what specifically and precisely, right?
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.240]   I mean, this letter has so many stacked on persuasions
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.560]   to it, it's almost like a letter you can't refuse,
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.240]   but clearly, precisely, there is something more specific
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.140]   he's thinking about, not just anything,
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:03.080]   but what is he not willing to do, right?
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.720]   And that's kind of important, because clearly,
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.520]   Apostle Paul, he's willing to make sure
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:14.440]   that Philemon fully understands the breadth of the scenario.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.600]   Who is asking, who the object of his affection should be,
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.240]   who his God is, what his God is doing,
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.040]   and who he himself, Philemon, this is who you are, too.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.240]   He's showing Philemon this broad breadth
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.180]   so that Philemon would have the full picture and worldview.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:36.140]   He would see the wisdom for himself, okay?
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.760]   And what's more, then, we ask this question of,
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.340]   why is it good that he consents,
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:45.120]   and he's not under compulsion?
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.280]   And so I wanna highlight this a bit here.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.460]   If you, you know, you guys see my highlights
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:54.760]   of the consent and not by compulsion and the free will.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.440]   If you do the comparison of the other translations,
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.120]   it kinda adds to the effect, doesn't it?
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.920]   The other translation talks about how
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.440]   it should not just simply be out of necessity.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.540]   I thought, oh, yeah, that's kind of interesting.
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.800]   It should definitely not be by force, that's the NIV,
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.520]   but this should be according to one's own willingness,
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.640]   his own accord, and voluntary, okay?
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.720]   So this much of it actually is pretty clear to us,
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.960]   and we could take that home and say,
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.680]   okay, lesson learned.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.280]   There are clearly things in the Bible,
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.580]   especially forgiving somebody,
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.080]   that should not be something I just think like,
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.420]   well, I guess I have to, Apostle Paul told me, you know?
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.940]   Pastor Mark told me to do it, I guess I have to, okay?
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:44.860]   And clearly, it should be something that we do voluntarily,
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:48.600]   but immediately, my mind went to,
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.540]   that's interesting because Jesus himself was like,
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:54.380]   if you don't forgive, I'm not gonna forgive you.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.220]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:57.460]   I'm paraphrasing there, but if you're not willing
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.520]   to forgive an individual, your Father in heaven
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.160]   is not gonna exercise grace upon you.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.680]   That kind of stubborn heartedness is not forgivable.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.780]   Rather, there's an entire parable I read
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:10.980]   at the very beginning of our overview,
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.960]   where God looks on that kind of resistant heart,
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.780]   reluctant to forgive heart, and says, you wicked servant.
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.180]   So then there's a part of us that says,
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.580]   well, surely, there are occasions and moments
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:28.580]   when compulsion is necessary, the push is necessary.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:32.780]   So another way to maybe even ask that is,
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.660]   for those of you guys who are parents in the room,
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:39.400]   is it wrong for you to mediate between two of your children?
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.060]   You say sorry now, say sorry, you know?
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:45.900]   And then to the other kids, like, you say it's okay,
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.660]   you know, take it.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.940]   I don't know, like, is that wrong?
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:53.540]   You know, is it wrong to help them see as young kids
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:57.160]   that these kind of reconciliation things must happen?
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.980]   Why is it so important for Apostle Paul,
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.700]   where he's doing not just not anything,
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.740]   but just about everything except forcing him
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.520]   by his authority to do it?
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.020]   And I think we have lots of lots of reasons,
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:13.540]   and I want you guys to discuss that in your groups,
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.100]   but this part gives us one.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.780]   He says here, so that your goodness, right,
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.520]   your goodness is not by compulsion.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.020]   And I thought about and meditated on this,
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.100]   it's so that your goodness is then real and genuine
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.440]   and actually good.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.940]   Take a moment to think about
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.460]   what forgiveness is by definition.
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:41.580]   Forgiveness by definition is you giving grace, right?
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:44.640]   You're giving grace to an individual
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.300]   who doesn't necessarily deserve it,
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:50.580]   and by law, you could hold somebody accountable,
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.120]   culpable, whatever it may be.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:57.540]   What's more, forgiveness means I am going to promise you
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:01.820]   that I will not hold this grudge against you, yes?
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.180]   I am not going to demand that you pay,
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.020]   but rather I am gonna promise you
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:12.080]   I am absorbing the offense by Christ's life in me.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.820]   That's the promise.
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:18.460]   Okay, do that reluctantly, right?
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:22.460]   I promise you, you know, I'll hold no grudge.
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:27.220]   It's just comedic because then forgiveness
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:30.100]   is no longer forgiveness.
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:34.500]   Grace is no longer grace when applied by law,
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:39.740]   by compulsion, by strict requirement of authority,
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:42.080]   you must give this grace.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.620]   You can't do that.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:45.020]   And another way to think about it is
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:47.600]   we know of examples in the Bible, instances,
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.820]   where we should not be doing things by compulsion,
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.300]   but by the purpose of our own heart.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:55.180]   One of the strange examples I wanna give to you
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:58.260]   is Ananias and Sapphira from Acts chapter five.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.480]   And you guys know the story well.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.380]   It was an amazing time, early in the church life,
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:06.300]   people were freely selling their possessions,
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.540]   sharing with their fellow brothers and sisters.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.140]   They had things in common,
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.160]   and it was like a big old grand family.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.180]   Ananias and Sapphira, they kind of feel the peer pressure.
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:21.100]   And so it's a story, we typically think of it as pride,
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:25.300]   where they were like, "Hey, we can be holy too."
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.700]   They tell everybody that they sold their property
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.700]   and that they gave everything.
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.300]   But by the scrutiny of Apostle Peter and the Holy Spirit,
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.460]   they find out Ananias lied.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:36.540]   It was only a portion.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:39.300]   And Ananias was like, "It's all of it."
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.580]   And then he dies.
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:44.240]   His wife comes in and Peter asks her,
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.560]   "How much was it sold for?
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.540]   "Was it so and so?"
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.880]   And she says, "Yes, yes, it was everything."
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.340]   And then she dies.
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.180]   What was that?
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:55.000]   In some sense, it was 100% just the arrogance
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.160]   of wanting to be more holy than you are,
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.600]   or at least seem like it,
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.360]   that you have some kind of holy credit.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.760]   But in another sense, it was just a reluctant heart.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.720]   They didn't wanna give that much to God.
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:10.940]   But then someone will say,
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.940]   "But at least they gave a portion.
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.680]   "That's more than nothing."
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:18.540]   But how does God see that?
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.180]   God sees that very reluctant heart as,
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:22.020]   "What is that?
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.300]   "Better you just keep it."
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.940]   Here's another passage that tells us
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:27.140]   exactly how God thinks.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.700]   He says, "So I thought,"
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:31.260]   Apostle Paul is talking about actually preparing
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.820]   a love gift and all this stuff.
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.900]   And he says, "So I thought it necessary
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:37.380]   "to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead of you
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.540]   "and arrange beforehand
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:41.660]   "your previously promised bountiful gift,
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:44.340]   "so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.320]   "and not affected by covetousness.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.000]   "Now this I say,
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.740]   "he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:54.940]   "and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.500]   So what it sounds like so far is he's just saying,
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:01.740]   "I am going to arrange beforehand this bountiful gift."
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:02.580]   And he's encouraged them,
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.760]   "Hey, go above and beyond what's normal,
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.920]   "because if you sow well,
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.900]   "you're going to reap well."
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:11.100]   But then he says,
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.920]   "Each one must do as he purposed in his heart,
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.920]   "not grudgingly or under compulsion,
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.660]   "for God loves a cheerful giver.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:24.100]   "And God is able to make all grace abound to you
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.900]   "so that always having all sufficiency in everything,
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:31.440]   "you may have abundance for every good deed."
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.100]   And so what we have here is the age-old theme for us
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.840]   that God 100% absolutely cares
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.380]   about the intention of the heart.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:41.880]   And whatever offering we're doing,
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.940]   whatever obedient act we're doing,
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.500]   that obedience must be then first
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.880]   something we wrestle with here, yes?
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.840]   Where God says,
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.480]   "You can actually do a ton of external action
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.000]   "for other people, for your own sake,
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.500]   "just for your own grievances,
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.320]   "maybe even just out of frustration.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.740]   "Oh, I don't want to think about it anymore."
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:02.580]   Fine.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.900]   That's not for God.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.460]   And therefore, he says,
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:11.620]   "What I want you to do is work on here
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:14.860]   "that your heart is purposeful, that is for me."
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.420]   Another way to think about this is
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.740]   I was thinking about the whole idea of law,
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:25.120]   God giving us law.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.380]   And the reason why I was thinking about that
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   is because I find nowadays a lot of people want policies
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:35.300]   and thorough instructions, which is good.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:38.060]   It's not bad because the law is always good
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:41.060]   in the sense that law has been always used by God
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:43.400]   for his good purposes, yes?
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.100]   But one of the ways I was thinking about this
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.940]   is why it's so important that Apostle Paul
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:51.240]   appeals to the Philemon, not just authoritatively says,
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.340]   "Just do it," okay?
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:58.020]   There's no scenario where if you do not forgive Philemon
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.420]   that it's good for you, the church,
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.060]   or Anisimus, or anybody, just do it.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:05.000]   I'm gonna write you a really, really short letter.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.280]   Do it, okay?
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:10.660]   But I think what's kind of beautiful about the passage
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.500]   is out of Apostle Paul's love for Philemon,
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.420]   he's treating him like an adult.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.980]   Because one of the things I was meditating is
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.260]   that kind of policy, law, instructional
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:24.760]   is for the immature, it's for the unrestrained,
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.440]   it's for children.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.660]   Scripture literally says in Galatians chapter three,
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:32.780]   you know that the law was your tutor,
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:37.780]   it was your guardian to point to Christ, right?
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:39.200]   The law, if you think about it,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.100]   is for a guest of the house,
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:43.060]   not somebody who is a child of the house,
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:44.180]   the owner of the house,
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.380]   or somebody who belongs in the house.
[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:48.740]   But law instruction, hey, this is what you need to do,
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.680]   here are your boundaries, don't do this,
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.220]   that's for a guest, okay?
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:57.500]   But what God wants for Philemon to do
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:01.960]   is bear the fruit of true Christlikeness.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.980]   To bear the fruit of an adult who is maturing
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.640]   and going above and beyond,
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.940]   not just simply the requirement of the law,
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.920]   but fulfilling the purposes of God and representing him,
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.380]   this is most Christlike.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:20.780]   A beautiful passage that comes from Galatians chapter five
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:23.820]   says, but the fruit of the Spirit is love,
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.480]   joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.100]   faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:33.780]   Against such things, there is no law.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:36.220]   Why?
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:40.340]   Because Philemon doesn't need an exhaustive instruction on,
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.680]   well, this is when you forgive, this is when you don't,
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.420]   this is when it's too much.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.420]   If an isthmus comes and it's found out
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:53.780]   that he actually stole a million dollars, right?
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.980]   Is there a law that says, Philemon, you can't forgive him?
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:01.460]   No, by exercising the character of Christ,
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:05.700]   Philemon can go to his full volitional extent
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:08.820]   on how much he would forgive an isthmus.
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:12.340]   Okay, so we meditated a lot on this whole idea of volition
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:14.380]   because it was such a repeated theme.
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.940]   We're gonna move now into the second part.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:19.940]   It says, for perhaps he was for this reason
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:22.560]   separated from you for a while,
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.540]   that you would have him back forever, okay?
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:30.020]   And I really saw this as like Apostle Paul
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:34.700]   highlighting to Philemon, do you see what God is doing?
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:39.180]   God is making a change that neither you or I can do
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:43.260]   because God is orchestrating to make this individual
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:48.260]   who was separated from you to now he is yours truly, okay?
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:50.700]   And verse 16 is the highlight where it says,
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:54.960]   no longer a slave, but more than a slave.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.320]   Beloved brother, one of the things that I sat there
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.380]   like kind of thinking and meditating on was,
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:03.040]   huh, this is really interesting.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.180]   Apostle Paul, is he just saying like, hey, you know what?
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:11.300]   In the end, it just works out a lot better this way, right?
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:14.660]   In the end, God did a work where an isthmus
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:16.820]   was trying to do an evil thing,
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.300]   but just like God would receive glory from Joseph
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.340]   when he was betrayed by his brothers, left in the pit,
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:27.180]   and then ultimately in Genesis chapter 50, he says,
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:32.060]   what you meant for evil, God meant for good, to preserve.
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:33.540]   Yes?
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.700]   Is he just saying that?
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.300]   And one of the interesting things that I was meditating on
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:41.900]   was in verse 16 when it says that no longer a slave,
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:46.380]   but more than a slave, a beloved brother,
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:50.400]   was Apostle Paul instructing Philemon
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.400]   to release Onesimus so that he is a free man, right?
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.500]   And to essentially then absolve or release him
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:01.320]   from his obligations as a slave.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:05.700]   I think you and I would see that in this passage,
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:09.100]   the focus and highlight is more so not like,
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.180]   I can't answer that question
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:13.020]   'cause it would be more speculation,
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.460]   but it'd be missing the point to just focus on
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:20.940]   his status as a slave or is he not a slave now,
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.380]   that kind of thing.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:26.620]   But rather this idea of God has done a work in Onesimus
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:29.380]   to such a way where now radically
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.380]   the relationship has changed so that
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.860]   even if Onesimus stayed a slave,
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:38.300]   that relationship is transformed.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:42.500]   Embedded within the relationship now is brotherhood.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.860]   And this is why I think the gospel is so beautiful
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:47.920]   because nowadays, nowadays,
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.580]   people are griping against hierarchies.
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.100]   You have more power than I do.
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:52.980]   We're equal.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:55.180]   No, you have majority and I have minority.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.420]   We have to be equal.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:00.540]   We have to be fully 100% represented in such an equal way.
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:04.380]   Hierarchy actually can be very godly
[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:06.520]   when you have true brotherhood.
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.700]   Yes?
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:11.320]   Two individuals on the same plane in equal power
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:14.220]   can be very wicked if they do not have
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.180]   the kindness of Christ,
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:19.260]   if they do not have the kind of mutual love
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:20.860]   and humility to see each other
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.380]   as more important than themselves.
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.500]   Yes?
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:29.500]   What will transcend this earthly relationship
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.340]   is the fact that God has done a work now
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:34.900]   in both of these individuals' lives where they're redeemed.
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:36.900]   And in that way,
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:38.380]   Apostle Paul is highlighting here,
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:41.720]   do you understand that the work God has done
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:44.220]   now radically changes everything?
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:48.200]   And so this is the push that Apostle Paul gives.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.160]   I do wanna highlight by way of summary,
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.980]   there is a theme in the gospel, right?
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:58.040]   Let's see here.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:02.680]   Okay, so one of the things that we saw clearly
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.960]   as a theme earlier on was God desires a heart,
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.080]   your voluntary love.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.240]   But one of the themes in the gospel
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:12.060]   is this idea of more than redemption in God's work.
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:13.460]   And I wanna end with this.
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.500]   When you see the passage,
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.960]   clearly Apostle Paul highlights the fact that,
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.280]   yes, you were separated for a little while,
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.100]   but now he is yours forever.
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.220]   Yes?
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.640]   And what's more, though he was a slave,
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:30.460]   now, especially to you, he is your beloved brother.
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.500]   And one of the beautiful things about the gospel
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.480]   is that there is this theme of like,
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.640]   so much more than back to status quo.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.360]   That yes, the gospel starts with,
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:44.660]   you have this ledger where you have tons of red.
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.700]   You sin, you incur debt, and you incur debt,
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:49.720]   and you can't pay it off.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:52.880]   Woe is to me, who is going to pay for my debt?
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.920]   And who is going to save me?
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.960]   Yes, praise be to God, do we go back to here?
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:01.320]   Now our balance is zero, now we're free.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:04.620]   No, the gospel says, do you understand
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.580]   that when Christ raises you,
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:09.800]   he brings you into such a stature
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.360]   that you have the stature of Christ, the very son of God?
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.920]   You have the righteousness of not a holy mark
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.380]   who was unstained, you have the righteousness
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:21.940]   of Christ Almighty who is the son of God?
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:27.420]   When God redeems, it's always so much more
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:29.260]   than back to zero is my point.
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:31.840]   And so there is this theme even in this,
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.200]   it's like, do you understand what God is doing?
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:39.140]   I don't expect from you, and I'm not telling you,
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:41.100]   just go back to normal, okay?
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:44.300]   Let's pretend like it never happened.
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:46.500]   Forgive him and accept him like it never happened.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:49.680]   That is not what Apostle Paul is saying.
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.180]   When there is true reconciliation,
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.780]   there is hope for so much more.
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:57.380]   That's true for your friendships,
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:59.380]   it's true even for husband and wives.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:02.100]   When they fight, they should never be like,
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:04.900]   oh, forget it, let's just squash it.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:05.920]   Okay, let's just squash it.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.320]   No, if reconciliation happens,
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.460]   they should feel even more intimate,
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.760]   they should feel like problems were solved,
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.460]   they should feel like they know each other
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.700]   to a greater extent, they should feel
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.460]   even more in love with each other.
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:21.000]   They should trust each other to greater degrees,
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.160]   and that's what the gospel does for us.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.380]   That it's more than going back to neutral land,
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:29.700]   but it's more than redemption for us, amen?
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:32.260]   By a final way of just review,
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:38.980]   you know, the various elements that we had so far,
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:43.180]   we had, you know, again, Philemon's encouraging character,
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:45.660]   and then convictions for us, we're thinking about,
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:48.180]   man, like what kind of person and character
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:51.140]   must I be in order to be a forgiver?
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:54.620]   When Apostle Paul is talking, I think about,
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:58.360]   wow, how much does Apostle Paul love both parties,
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.860]   that he's not actually being partial to one,
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:04.260]   but rather using his wisdom and humility, right,
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:08.620]   in order to appeal rather than just direct.
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.420]   And then what are some obligations for us
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:12.840]   as the offending party, and then today,
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.140]   we're coming to heart issues.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:16.980]   In the issue of giving forgiveness
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:18.940]   to people that have offended us,
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.940]   where are our motives?
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:26.660]   What other motives prevent us from forgiving?
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:28.360]   What are God's motives?
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.300]   What ought to be our motives?
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:32.740]   These are the kind of heart questions
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:35.540]   and work that we must do in order to get to a posture
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:38.540]   where we can say, not just here or there,
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:42.180]   but we can fully accept an individual who was once lost.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:43.580]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:53.960]   Lord, you have for us a grand and majestic vision
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.740]   that we would be like you.
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:00.880]   You have commanded us, Lord God, in the scripture,
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:03.460]   that we are to mimic you in every way.
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:05.180]   And Lord, one of the first thing you say
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.520]   is that we should love the same way you do.
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:13.300]   God, we're so thankful that you have shown us this love,
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.980]   that you empower us to exercise this love,
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:18.700]   but we also confess that it's difficult.
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:21.580]   I pray, Father God, that whatever we are accustomed to,
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:24.300]   whatever we think is our own limitation,
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.380]   help us, Lord God, to just push away all of that
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:31.500]   and to trust you, to trust you with your empowerment,
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.260]   to trust you with your word,
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:35.140]   that what you produced in the gospel,
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:38.500]   what you produced, Father, through reconciliation,
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.540]   is always going to be beautiful
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:43.260]   and God is gonna be wrought by the Spirit.
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:46.400]   Lord, we do ask that in the church here,
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.640]   God, our relationships would be marked
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.540]   by this kind of grace, this kind of love and care,
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:55.500]   where, Lord, for whatever offenses we have,
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:58.060]   we're long-suffering with one another,
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:01.340]   but what's more, we're eager to give people
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:03.140]   our love and forgiveness,
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:06.520]   even to the degree that we'll pursue somebody,
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.800]   that we'll go and take the risk to talk,
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.620]   so that, God, love would be given and received.
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:14.020]   We thank you, Lord, for making this all possible.
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:15.900]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:19.900]   Okay, so just as a heads up to you,
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:22.800]   next week is May 31st, Wednesday.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.380]   Please study verse 17 through 20.
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:28.500]   It's more of the motivations and reasons
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:31.200]   why Philemon should forgive.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.880]   And so, make sure you list that and work through it.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.860]   The week after is our final week on June 7th,
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:40.760]   and so we'll have our verse 21 and 25 study
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.260]   and ending review.
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:43.580]   Heads up to all of you guys
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.780]   that the next study is going to begin August 30th,
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:49.640]   and we're gonna be working through the book of Galatians.
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.660]   And then, here is your discussion questions.
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:56.720]   So, what other instances can you think of
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:59.180]   where we should not be moved by compulsion,
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.940]   but by free will?
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:03.600]   And when are those instances where it's okay
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.660]   to just feel like, I've got a duty to fulfill,
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:08.540]   I'm just gonna do it, okay?
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:11.500]   List what would be the effect
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:14.860]   if Philemon had no motive or heart desire to forgive,
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:18.100]   i.e., if Philemon forgave out of just principle,
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:20.140]   it's like, I just know I need to do it.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:23.020]   How would that affect himself, Onesimus,
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.080]   Jesus the Savior, or the community?
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.820]   What are some false motives or thoughts
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:29.540]   that prevent us from giving forgiveness?
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:32.260]   And then, sharing some stories.
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.380]   What are some experiences where God's plan
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:38.160]   just ended up so much better than your own, okay?
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.940]   And also, just kind of talk about
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.780]   if something works out better,
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:43.700]   are we allowed to just attribute that,
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:46.460]   to be like, God did this, you know?
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:49.140]   And then finally, to forgive is a promise,
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:51.140]   as God does, that we will not hold a grudge
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.380]   against someone who has repented.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.180]   How does God's sovereignty help us
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:57.420]   give this kind of promise, okay?
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:59.020]   Have a great time of discussion.
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:03.020]   (audience chattering)
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:05.180]   (silence)
