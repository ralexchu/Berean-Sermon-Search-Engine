[00:15:46.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   Good morning.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.520]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   Let me get a few announcements before we get started.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.880]   First of all, today, our members meeting is at 2 o'clock.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.440]   And so that's just enough time for you to go grab lunch,
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.120]   come back, and right at 2 o'clock-- not 202, not 203,
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.080]   but right at 2 o'clock.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.640]   So please come into this room before we make an announcement
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.600]   asking you to come in.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.280]   Try to come in here five minutes before.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.360]   So right at 2 o'clock, we can get started.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   And then after that, obviously, we have booths that are set up.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.760]   And even if you're not a member and you just kind of want
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.160]   to know what's going on at church, you can go and visit.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.480]   Some of them have people there.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.560]   Some of them don't.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.240]   But those of you who are members,
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.680]   obviously, after the second service,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.840]   we'll be able to-- not second service.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.260]   After the members meeting, you'll
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.800]   be able to go out and interact.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.640]   And some of them are looking for recruits.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.280]   Some of them are just informational.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.580]   So you can go there and just--
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.360]   you'll find out what's going on at church
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.680]   and how different people are serving at the church.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.200]   And so that's going to start right at 2 o'clock.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.600]   So go and grab lunch.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.880]   You can grab it and come back and eat it in the cafe,
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.120]   or you can grab it and come back.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.160]   So that's going on.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.280]   College Welcome Lunch is happening on October 23
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.520]   to 1245.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.120]   If you have any questions about that,
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.880]   please contact Pastor Nate.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.560]   And then Thanksgiving regional dinners.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.120]   So if you are willing to open up your home,
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.080]   it can fit anywhere from 15 to 20 people.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.680]   If you can sign up for that, they're
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.080]   going to distribute--
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.360]   the people who are signing up.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.840]   And then for Thanksgiving dinner,
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.400]   we're going to have regional dinners.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.440]   And then for those of you who will participate,
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.120]   please sign up.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.580]   If you haven't signed up yet, please
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.800]   sign up so that they can put you into the groups,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.960]   appropriate groups, as soon as they can.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.400]   And then one last thing is the outreach team
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.120]   has a fasting and prayer sign up that's outside.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.960]   And I know it's designated for people
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.000]   who are praying for loved ones that they're
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.040]   trying to invite for November 6, where the gospel message is
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.920]   going to be preached.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.880]   And then there's going to be a Q&A session afterwards.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.200]   But even if that's not the case, if you can sign up and help
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.080]   pray for them, and even if that's not the case,
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.000]   my message this morning is going to be on prayer and fasting.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.840]   And so I want to encourage you guys to get in the habit
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.960]   of praying and fasting.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.160]   So if you want to do that without signing up,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.280]   that's also OK.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.320]   But if you want to participate and get emails as a reminder,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.600]   there is a table set up outside for prayer and fasting table.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.140]   So if you can go there and sign up, it'll be easier.
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.240]   I think we've been having some issues online accessing
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.400]   the page.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.800]   And so if you want to go directly,
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.560]   that will be there after service.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.760]   This morning, after we pray for the offering and pray set,
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.760]   our sister Grace is going to be coming up.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.360]   And she's going to give her testimony.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.600]   And we'll be baptized this morning.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.000]   So again, if you are visiting us for the first time,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.240]   we have a offering basket, offering thing,
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.440]   right against the wall.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.960]   As you're going out, you can drop off your offering there.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.440]   And for the rest of you, if you are paying electronically,
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.240]   please try to use Zelle.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.800]   Venmo and PayPal is open.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.680]   But we want to encourage you to use Zelle more than the others
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.000]   if you can.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.840]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.340]   Let's pray.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:15.680]   Gracious, loving Father, we thank you so much for loving us,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.280]   persevering with us, being patient with us,
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:25.400]   reviving us, that we may worship you, love you, honor you.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.400]   Lord, we pray that your word will continue
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.760]   to guide us and lead us, that your spirit will convict us,
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.560]   that your love will continue to guide us.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.800]   Lord, let our singing be done in spirit and in truth.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   And even in our giving, may it be
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.680]   done as an act of worship, Lord God, to please you
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.040]   and honor you.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.240]   May it be multiplied for your use, your kingdom,
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.120]   and your glory.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.240]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.740]   Amen.

[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.680]   This first song, we introduced it last week from Everlasting.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.240]   And the song is inspired by Psalm 90.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.400]   And I would like to continue to read Psalm 90 from verse 12.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.920]   "So teach us to number our days, that we
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.840]   may get a heart of wisdom.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.400]   Return, O Lord, how long?
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.480]   Have pity on your servants.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.880]   Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love,
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.920]   that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.160]   and for as many years as we have seen evil.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.960]   Let your work be shown to your servants
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.520]   and your glorious power to their children.

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.520]   So with that, let us sing the song.

[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.200]   Hi, I'm Grace Nafiti.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   And this is my testimony.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   I am not the same person I was in 2011
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   when I first became a believer.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.200]   In fact, I'm not the same person I was three years ago
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.200]   when I first became a believer.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   I'm not the same person I was three years ago when
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   I first came to Berean.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   Christ changed me inside out.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   He spun me around and made me brand new.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   Completely clean is such an understatement
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   when describing what the blood of Christ did for me.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Before I was a believer, I was someone
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   who didn't know God too well.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   However, not only did I know pain,
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   but I allowed it to drive every decision I ever made
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   until I asked God to be my everything.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   He allowed me to go through so much tribulation that
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   made me unknowingly desperate for him
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   to do everything that I did.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   I was raised in a Christian God-fearing home.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:12.200]   God was ever-present in my daily life, or in our daily lives.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   It would be impossible to suggest or to even think
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   that God does not exist.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.200]   I knew from an incredibly young age
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   that God was the foundation which our family was built upon.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   My parents' faith was so strong,
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.200]   and their relationship and their love for Christ
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   was unlike anything I've ever witnessed
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   and still is to this day.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.200]   Yet I struggled every day since I was a child
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   with the idea of Christ being my God
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   and that he had my best interest at heart.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   Yet being the loving, almighty, wonderful father
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   that he is, he loved me still.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   Backstory. I struggled a lot growing up.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   From elementary school till the end of high school,
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   I suffered from depression, anxiety, suicide, anorexia,
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:20.200]   drugs, alcohol abuse, and the inability to cope.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:28.200]   I was raped and molested at a young age.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   I attempted suicide more times
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   than I can count on my fingers and toes.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   I was a broken mess, seeking love and comfort
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   every direction I looked.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   Yet I never found it because I was never looking
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.200]   in the right direction.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   I was always looking to Christ.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   In fact, I rejected him the same way people rejected me.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   I grew up feeling like I was worth nothing,
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   like I was garbage piled up on the side of the road.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   Little did I know the plan God had for me.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.200]   The last time I attempted suicide
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   was my last year of high school, my junior year.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   Lying in a bathroom full of blood,
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   my parents found me and saved me.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   Even unconscious, I could hear my mama and my daddy
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   crying out to God that I was born to bring God glory
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   and that they'd continue to hold on to that dream
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   my mama had before I was born.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   God was going to use my life in a mighty way
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   and that they trusted that he would do just that.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   In those moments as they cried out to God
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   and I was in and out of consciousness,
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   it was as if God was moving my heart.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.200]   I believe he was telling me that it was now or never,
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   that everything that I was craving,
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   everything I desired, and everything I needed was him.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   No matter how far I pushed him away, he loved me anyway.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   That week, I wrestled with my flesh
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   and struggled to understand why I was so moved by God
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   to live for him when I was so desperate to end my life.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   I cried out to God and prayed for forgiveness,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   that I would live the life he had planned for me
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   and that I wanted him to be my everything.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   To be the air that I breathe, the reason I live,
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   and the love that I need.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   Although unsure if I would be able to walk daily as a believer
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   and stand firm for the word and for my faith in Christ,
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.200]   at that moment, I knew I would be choosing to walk alongside my parents
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.200]   and their support in walking the straight and narrow
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   and the road less traveled.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   I would not be alone.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   A book my daddy often talked about was the book of Joshua.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   How fitting, since his only son is named Joshua. Ha ha.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   But during this time, two verses my daddy often mentioned
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   that would help me look at my fears and uncertainty
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   through the eyes of the word were these.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   Joshua 1.9, "Have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   Do not be terrified nor dismayed, for the Lord our God is with you
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   wherever you go."
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   And Joshua 24.15, "But if it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the Lord,
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   choose for yourself today whom you will serve,
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   whether the gods which your father served,
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.200]   which were beyond the Euphrates River,
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:20.200]   or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   I cannot say that life was peachy keen after choosing to walk this walk of faith.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   There were many more heartbreaking trials and tribulations that I would go through,
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   terrible decisions that my sin and worldly desires would choose to go through,
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   and struggles I still wrestle with to this day.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   But daily I put my trust in the one who saves,
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   and daily I pray for endurance to continue to run towards God and flee from temptation.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:07.200]   As of September 24th this year, I am now three years in my sobriety from drugs and alcohol.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   Hallelujah.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   [applause]
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   Even with all this, God is so faithful.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   I have yet to go through anything on my own.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.200]   He has been there every step of the way, guiding me, holding my hand,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   and helping me through it all for his glory.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   God truly wastes nothing.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   My life was what the world deemed a failure.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   The educators in my life called me stupid and hopeless,
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   and a medical professional referred to me as unsalvageable, worthless.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   As much as I wanted to accept all those titles in my life, Christ died so that I could be saved.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   He loved me so much that he did not let me go to someone like me,
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   who has felt worthless my whole life, yet to be told that I am worth a lot,
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:24.200]   that God sent his only son, whom he loved so much, to die so that I could live
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   and have a fighting chance to be in his presence.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.200]   Well, that is just something I cannot waste.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   I am who I am because the I am tells me who I am, and I am his.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   Thank you.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   [Applause]
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   [Pause]
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   [Applause]
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   Thank you, Grace, for that powerful testimony.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   I feel like I don't need to preach.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   You guys are all fed already.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   If you can turn your Bibles to 2 Chronicles 7, 13-14.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   I'm going to be taking a one-week break, and I want to talk about prayer and fasting.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   I'll explain why as I go.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   Let me read 2 Chronicles 7, 13-14.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   "If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land,
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   or if I send pestilence among my people, and my people who are called by my name
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   Let's pray.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   Heavenly Father, I pray that you would anoint this time, anoint these words.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   May it go forth and accomplish what you have ordained.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:42:01.200]   I pray, Father God, that as we have come to seek you, open our eyes, soften our hearts, our ears,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   that we may hear from you and you alone. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   The reason why I wanted to take this day to emphasize the prayer and fasting
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   is because of what we see going on around us.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   Those of you who have been a Christian for a while, 20, 30, 40 years, maybe plus,
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   imagine if we fell asleep in the 80s and 90s, and we woke up today to see what is going on around us.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:42.200]   It is shocking. It is shocking how far the church has fallen,
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   how far our society has embraced immorality so openly,
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   and has become so desensitized because the media is pushing it in our face.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   Now, it happened, obviously, through the years.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   And we'd be shocked by one thing, and then we'd get used to it,
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   and push the envelope further, and then we'd get used to it and push the envelope further.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   But if you remember what it was like back in the 80s or 90s, or even just 20 years ago,
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   it is shocking what is on television. It is shocking what the politicians are saying.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   We have today in our culture where abortion is being debated inside the church.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   Again, if this is the only Christianity you've known, maybe it's normal to you,
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   but even the most liberal of denominations, this discussion was not going on inside the church.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.200]   The killing of babies is being debated among Christians or professing Christians.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   That is shocking how far we have fallen.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   The government is trying to get it so that young children can choose to have a sex change
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.200]   without the permission of their parents.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.200]   And they are trying to even push that if the parents are against it,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:20.200]   that child services can come and actually take away your children.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.200]   Shocking.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:28.200]   This is not just wrong, it's shocking that this is even being debated,
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.200]   that this is being talked about.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   And if you speak against that in the medical field, you could even lose your license.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   That's how far it's gone.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.200]   We're talking about Christian persecution.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:46.200]   We've always talked about it. We've always prayed for North Koreans.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:52.200]   We've prayed for the communist government in China and the Middle East.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   This week, there was an article that came out that PayPal was actually going to target people
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   who say things that are hurtful.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   Meaning, we know exactly who they're targeting.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   If you basically say that homosexuality is wrong, that you're against sex change for children,
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:20.200]   that they have the right to come into your bank account and take $2,500 from your bank account and shut you down.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   PayPal, right?
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   We're trying to move away from PayPal right now.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   And I hope all Christians do.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:34.200]   The fact that they had the audacity to actually even leak that out,
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.200]   that half the country, more than half the country, believes that this is wrong.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:44.200]   And to have no ripple in our culture that somebody's saying something like that.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   I mean, obviously, every biblically-minded Christian would have to take that stand,
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.200]   because that's what the Bible says.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   And if PayPal is bold enough to say something like that,
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   think about all the other institutions that are openly hostile toward the Christian faith.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   What's coming next?
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   So, we are in a culture where it is not possible to be a nominal Christian.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:21.200]   That our environment is forcing us to take a stand.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   Do you believe it or not believe it?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   That you will either live your life compromised in the biblical faith,
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   professing to know God, and yet by your life denying Him,
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   or persecution is coming.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.200]   Banks are going to target you. Your school is going to target you.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   We're not that far away from college entrance interviews
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   that they will ask you, "What is your position on homosexuality?"
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.200]   And if you give the wrong answer, they will not let you in based on that answer.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.200]   We are not that far away from your job interviews.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.200]   I'm not talking about years. I'm talking about even now.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   The companies are actually openly saying things like that.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   HR is coming and saying things like that.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   If they interview you and they ask you that question,
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   "What is your stance on homosexuality?"
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   And you give the wrong answer, if you give the biblical answer,
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.200]   that they will not hire you.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   We're there.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   On top of that, we've been talking about nuclear war
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   probably the closest to we've ever heard before, at least in my lifetime.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.200]   And I know that there was a Cuban Missile Crisis back then.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   But for the first time, at least in my life,
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   where there's actually talks about, "Was Russia crazy enough to do this?"
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:42.200]   And if they do, what are we going to do about it?
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.200]   Maybe some of you, it's a little bit more personal than that.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.200]   As crazy as the world has become,
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   as immoral and as bold as they have become,
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   maybe you just lost your job.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   Maybe you're having problems at home with your wife and husband.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   Maybe you're struggling with your children, uncertainty of future,
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   whatever it may be.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   The world has gone mad and it's crazy.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   So when we're in these situations, our temptation is to, first and foremost,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   especially in the Western world, is we need to organize.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   We need to march. We need to get enough signatures.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   And we need to get people in the right office.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   We need to change this legislation. We need to fight all of this.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   And all of these things have its place, and it's great.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   Because you and I live in a free country.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   The majority of the people in the world do not have the freedom to speak.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.200]   They do not have the freedom to vote.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   So when the government says that if you go to church, we will shut down your business,
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   they have no way to fight that, the majority of the people.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   But you and I don't live in that country.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   We have the freedom to speak. We have the freedom to march.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.200]   We have the freedom to vote and speak out.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   But along with that, there is a great temptation to think
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   that we're going to fight their power with our power.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   And we have completely missed the point.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:08.200]   The text that I read in 2 Corinthians 7, 13-14 is a dedication service
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   after they built the temple where God comes and says,
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   "This is the reason why this temple was built."
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.200]   And to remind Israel of that time and for many generations to come
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   that this is the purpose of God's presence in Israel.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   He says, "If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain."
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   You notice here, He says, "If I shut up the heavens."
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   God is sovereign.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   He doesn't say, "When your enemies have become strong."
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   He didn't say, "When poor decisions have been made."
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   God is completely sovereign.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   And even to this day, as crazy as things have become in our generation,
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   we still believe in a sovereign God.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   God is not any less sovereign today than He was yesterday
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   or 10 years ago or 100 years ago.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   He's the same sovereign God who has absolute control over all things.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   He says, "If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain,
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   if I command the locusts to devour the land,
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   or if I send pestilence among My people,
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   if you see that there is desperateness in your land,
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   and if My people who are called by My name
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   humble themselves and pray and seek My face,
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   turn from their wicked ways,
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin,
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   and will heal their land."
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   He says, "I will hear, and I will heal, and I will forgive
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   if you recognize that it is I who is sovereign."
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   Our natural tendency in the Western world is to organize,
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   to march, to elect, to speak, to have conferences,
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   write books, start a blog.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   There is a place for all of these things,
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   especially because we have the freedom to do that.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   We have the access to do that.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   But the primary place for a Christian,
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   when we see that we are desperate and we are in need,
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   is to humble ourselves before God and seek His face.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   And our first instinct ought to be to pray.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   And our second instinct ought to be to fast,
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   to pray and to fast.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   See, in the early church, fasting was a given.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   And I'm not saying this this morning
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   because I have this figured out,
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.200]   and I want you to follow my example.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.200]   In fact, I am saying this because of the exact opposite.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   We have become self-reliant.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   We've been doing this for so long.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   We just plug in the holes, do the right thing,
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   place the right people, certain personalities,
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   certain giftedness, and we can keep this thing going.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   But we know that true fruit comes
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   when we are desperate before Him.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   We can hold on to a form of godliness and yet have no power.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:10.200]   We work hard, we labor to establish what we can do,
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   but there's no power.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.200]   Radical transformations.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.200]   You know the testimony that Grace gave this morning?
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   No amount of counseling would have changed her.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   No amount of program, no amount of discipleship
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.200]   would have saved the girl in that position.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.200]   It was the power of God.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   Power of God.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.200]   And I believe probably the prayers of her parents
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   brought the power of the gospel into her life.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.200]   There's no amount of organizations,
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.200]   there's no amount of work, no amount of marching,
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   no amount of writing that can bring a soul that was that lost
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   to be able to give her testimony this morning.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   In the early church, it was a given.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   Matthew 6.16, it says,
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.200]   "Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as hypocrites do."
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   He said, "Whenever."
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   He didn't say, "When you decide," or "If you pray."
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   He said, "Whenever," because he understood.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   The early church understood.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   In fact, if you read the scriptures in the Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.200]   you cannot escape example after example of example
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.200]   of them praying and fasting constantly.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.200]   In Acts 13.2, when the first missionaries were being sent out,
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.200]   it said, "While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting,
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.200]   the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart from me Barnabas and Saul
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   for the work to which I have called them.'"
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   When was the Holy Spirit ignited?
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.200]   When they were praying and fasting.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   Acts 14.23, "When they had appointed elders for them in every church,
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.200]   having prayed with fasting,
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.200]   they commanded them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   Even Jesus himself, before he enters into ministry,
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:56.200]   he goes into the woods and he prays and he fasts for 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.200]   Now, he gets tested by the Word of God,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   where it says, "Well, God said this and God said that."
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   But we forget, and then we emphasize in that,
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.200]   that we need to know the Word of God because Satan is going to twist the Word of God.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   But we sometimes skim over the fact that he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.200]   before he had this encounter with Satan.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   A call to prayer and fast is the first response
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.200]   when we see a sense of urgency.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.200]   It is the first response.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.200]   Not something we do after we have planned, after we have worked,
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   say, "Lord, bless our work, bless our speech, bless this sermon."
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   But the first thing that God calls us to do is to humble ourselves and pray and seek him.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.200]   Whatever we do without prayer and fasting leads to arrogance.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:49.200]   It leads to human reliance. It leads to our pride.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.200]   We think that our organization somehow did it.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.200]   We figured out how to do small group.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   That our way of discipleship is somehow more superior than the church down the street.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   That my pastor can preach better than your pastor.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   And we become arrogant to think that it is our work,
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   it is our work, it is our ability, it is our talent,
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   it is our experience that caused this fruit.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:16.200]   Where we know full well that Jesus says,
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   "You cannot bear fruit until you abide in me."
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:25.200]   The first call is to pray and to fast.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   Fasting is a way of humbling ourselves before God
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.200]   because our natural tendency is to become proud.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   Whatever you do, you become proud.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   Even with our children, if they do a little bit better, we compare with other children.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.200]   When they work a little bit faster, when they read a little bit better,
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.200]   our tendency all our lives is to compare.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   And as soon as we see ourselves a little bit better,
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.200]   our natural tendency is to become proud.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   So if we're not actively seeking to humble ourselves,
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   it doesn't matter what kind of personality, whether you talk a lot,
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   or whether you have a soft voice, whether you're introverted or extroverted,
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   when we don't humble ourselves before the Lord,
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.200]   we actively allow pride to seep into our hearts.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   Fasting is one of the most tangible ways for us to humble ourselves before God.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   Psalm 35, 13 says, "But as for me, when they were sick,
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   my clothing was sackcloth, and I humbled my soul with fasting."
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.200]   I humbled myself with fasting.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   So first and foremost, fasting is an active way for us to humble ourselves,
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.200]   recognizing that we are desperate for Him.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:42.200]   In fact, the Day of Atonement is the only time where God commanded fasting.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   He calls us to fast.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   He says we ought to fast, but Day of Atonement, it was commanded to fast.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   In fact, it was so prominent in the Israelites in Acts 27.9,
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   when Apostle Paul addresses it, he says,
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.200]   he calls the Day of Atonement "the fast," just simply "the fast."
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   If you read that not knowing, you wouldn't know that he's talking about the Day of Atonement.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   Every Jew knew.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.200]   Instead of saying, "The Day of Atonement, the Day of Atonement,"
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   they would just call it "the fast."
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:15.200]   And the reason for that is because that's how the Bible describes it.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   In Leviticus 23.17.27, it says,
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:22.200]   "On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month, in the Day of Atonement,
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble your souls
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.200]   and present an offering by fire to the Lord."
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:34.200]   On this Day of Atonement, they were all to fast.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.200]   It wasn't just a few priests and a high priest that went and did all the work
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.200]   and the whole rest of the nation just stood there and watched.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   The whole nation fasted.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:49.200]   Leviticus 23.32, "It is to be a Sabbath of complete rest to you,
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   and you shall humble your souls on the ninth of the month at the evening,
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   and evening until evening you shall keep your Sabbath."
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   The Day of Atonement was a constant reminder that they were in constant need of God.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   Even if they had the greatest Day of Atonement last year,
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   even if they gave sacrifices throughout the year,
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   the Day of Atonement reminded them repeatedly over and over and over again
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   that they are desperate in need of God.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   That's why in Joel 2.12-13, when Israel is called to repentance, it says,
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.200]   "Yet even now, declares the Lord, return to me with all your heart,
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   and with fasting, weeping, and mourning, and rend your heart and not simply your garments.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   Return to the Lord God, for He is gracious and compassionate,
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness, and relenting of evil."
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.200]   We have to humble ourselves.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   Jonah 3.5, when the reluctant prophet went and preached the gospel,
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:59.200]   reluctantly, the power of God's message brings the whole evil city to repentance.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   And this is the people of Nineveh believed God, and they called, "A fast,"
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:18.200]   So the first act of every Christian when we are faced with urgency
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:25.200]   is not to organize, to write, to complain, to put fingers, to work harder.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:32.200]   No, the first and the most important thing that God calls us to do is to humble ourselves and pray,
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:37.200]   to seek Him, to go to Him.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:43.200]   Secondly, fasting is the greatest spiritual weapon that we have.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   Not our intellect, not books, not training, but prayer.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   Ephesians 6.10-12, it says, "Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in strength of whose might?
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:06.200]   His might. Not the might of the leaders, not the might of the organization, but His might."
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:13.200]   Why? Because, "Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil."
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   Schemes of the devil. There's a reason why this language is used,
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.200]   because the devil's work is constant scheming.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   You don't see it coming.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.200]   When you are under the influence of our enemy, you do not know it.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   That's why he calls it scheming.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.200]   And you notice here, he says, "Put on the full armor of God, so you can get your sword,
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   and go find where they are and attack them." He doesn't say that.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   He said, "No, so that you can withstand the schemes of the devil."
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.200]   In other words, he's constantly coming for you.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.200]   It's like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour, and he's coming for you.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.200]   You don't have to go look for him. He's there.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   And he says, "Put on the full armor of God, so that you can withstand the scheme of the devil."
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.200]   You see, when we are fighting for righteousness without prayer,
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.200]   you are falling right into the trap of the scheme of the devil.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.200]   Because you're fighting with your might.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.200]   You're fighting with your strength.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.200]   That you think that somehow, if you have enough accountability,
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.200]   that if you read enough books, if you memorize enough scripture by your own strength,
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   that somehow you're going to overcome the scheming of the devil.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:27.200]   He says, "To rely on him, for our struggle is not against flesh and blood."
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.200]   In other words, you're not going to see it coming.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.200]   You're not going to see it coming. You're not going to see, "There's the devil. There's what he's doing."
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   He said, "No, he's scheming."
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.200]   "Your struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers,
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:46.200]   against the world, forces of darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places."
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:55.200]   So when the devil is active, and it is effective, you don't even know about it.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:03.200]   And the more effective he is, the more you are unaware that that's what he's doing.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.200]   It is something that I've observed through the years,
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:12.200]   that sometimes righteousness without prayer and humbling ourselves before God,
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.200]   sometimes does more damage than good.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.200]   Let me tell you why.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:29.200]   Because righteousness easily turns into self-righteousness when we are not humbled before God.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:37.200]   Every good thing that we do turns into judgment of others when we are not constantly humbled before God.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:44.200]   And so the devil schemes, even with the greatest intention, even with all our studies.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.200]   The devil is constantly scheming to trip us up.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.200]   And that's why he says, "After you put on the full armor of God," Ephesians 6, 18-19,
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.200]   "with all prayer, petition, pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert,
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.200]   with all perseverance, petition for all the saints, and pray on my behalf."
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.200]   Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:13.200]   After you put on the full armor of God, he says, "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray."
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   Fasting is praying with an exclamation mark.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:22.200]   You're not simply petitioning. You're crying out.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.200]   That's what fasting is.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.200]   In Colossians 4, 2-3, it says, "Devote yourselves to prayer."
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.200]   Devote yourselves to prayer.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   "Keep an alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.200]   Pray at the same time for us as well."
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.200]   Pray, pray, pray. Devote yourself to prayer.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.200]   Do you remember that story in Matthew 17,
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.200]   where his disciples go out and they're casting out demons,
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.200]   and they couldn't cast out this one particular demon,
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.200]   and they come out and say, "Lord, we did all these miracles, and we couldn't cast out this demon."
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   Remember what Jesus said?
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:58.200]   He said, "But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.200]   There are certain things that God will place in our lives
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   that can only be cast out by prayer and fasting.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.200]   God will allow certain things that are happening in our lives
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.200]   because God wants us to pray and fast.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.200]   There's turmoil, struggle, political, financial, whatever that may be.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.200]   There are certain things that God allows in our lives, in our generation, in our churches,
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.200]   so that we can pray and fast and humble ourselves before Him.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.200]   Because God's greatest desire for us is not to live in peace and harmony.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   It's not so that you and I can live in a country where we are free to gather together.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.200]   That is not His greatest desire.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.200]   If living in a free country and having the freedom to say whatever we want,
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.200]   raise our children however we want, evangelize wherever we want,
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.200]   then that's what He would have given us.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.200]   But that's not His greatest desire for us.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.200]   His greatest desire for us is Him.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.200]   It's Him at all times.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:09.200]   So sometimes persecution is what's best for us.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.200]   Sometimes turmoil is what's best for us.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.200]   Sometimes financial instability is the best for us.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:24.200]   Sometimes the greatest thing that can happen to us is isolation and loneliness.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:30.200]   Because in the midst of loneliness, we find the preciousness of Christ.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   When things are dark, the light shines even brighter.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:41.200]   The greatest thing that He has given us is to pray.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.200]   But fourth and finally, and this is where I want to camp out for a little bit,
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.200]   because I believe that ultimately in Jesus' words,
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.200]   fasting is an expression of hungering and thirsting for God.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   Remember in Matthew 9, 14 to 15, John's disciples come and ask Jesus,
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   "Why do we and the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast?"
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   And Jesus said to them, "The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   Can they? For the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.200]   Now what does that mean?
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.200]   Why are they fasting before Jesus came, and then while they came they didn't fast,
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.200]   and then after He leaves, He says they will fast again?
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:37.200]   So according to Jesus, what is the purpose of fasting?
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   The purpose of fasting is longing for God.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.200]   That's what He is saying here. He says, "Before I came, they were fasting.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.200]   But now that the bridegroom is here, there's no need to fast because I'm here with you.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.200]   But one day I will be gone and they will fast again."
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.200]   So what is the purpose of fasting according to Jesus?
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.200]   It's longing for Christ.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   Longing for Christ is the most tangible way that you and I have to humble ourselves
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.200]   and cry out, "We need you."
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:15.200]   More than food, more than entertainment, more than any temptation in this world,
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:21.200]   I desire you. That's what fasting is.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:32.200]   In Luke chapter 14, 16-20, Jesus gives a story about people who wouldn't respond to the call to the banquet.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   And obviously He's talking about the kingdom of God.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.200]   And this is what He says.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.200]   "He said to him, 'A man was giving a big dinner and he invited many.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.200]   And at the dinner hour, he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited,
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.200]   'Come, for everything is ready now.'
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.200]   But they all, like, began to make excuses.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   The first one said to him, 'I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   Please consider me excused.'
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.200]   Another one said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen and I am going to try them out.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.200]   Please consider me excused.'
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:10.200]   Another one said, 'I have married a wife and for that reason I cannot come.'"
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   John Piper in his book, "Hunger for God," in explaining this text, says this,
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.200]   "The greatest enemy of hunger for God is not poison but apple pie.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.200]   It is not the banquet of the wicked that dulls our appetite for heaven,
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.200]   but the endless nibbling at the table of the world.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:32.200]   It is not the X-rated video but the prime-time dribble of triviality we drink in every night.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:39.200]   For all the ill that Satan can do when God describes what keeps us from the banquet table of his love
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:44.200]   is a piece of land, a yoke of oxen, and a wife."
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:51.200]   It is not Satan, it is not the powers, it is not the government, it is not Russia, it is not North Korea.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:58.200]   He says, "It is a piece of land, a yoke of oxen, and a wife."
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:06.200]   Fasting is one of the most tangible ways that we can come before God and say, "Yes, I am committed to you.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:14.200]   You are my groom. You are my Lord. You are my treasure.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:21.200]   I struggle, I am tempted, my eyes continue to wander, but Lord, help me.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:28.200]   I am married to you. I hunger and thirst for you."
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:37.200]   In Psalm 42, 1 or 2, it says, "As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants for you, O God."
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:45.200]   When was the last time you can honestly say that you panted for Christ?
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   When was the last time you can read this Psalm and say, "Yes, this is my prayer.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:59.200]   My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?"
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:09.200]   When was the last time you were so thirsty that you couldn't think of anything else but to drink?
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.200]   Jesus says, "I am the living water."
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.200]   The water that you drink of this world, you will drink and you will be thirsty again.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.200]   He said, "I am the bread of life."
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.200]   The bread that you eat, you will eat and then you will have to eat again.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.200]   But I am the bread of life.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.200]   He who eats of me and drinks of me will never hunger and never thirst.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:37.200]   Hungering and thirsting is expressed in our fasting.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:44.200]   He said, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.200]   Not the one who wins a lottery.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   Not the one who goes to the right church.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:57.200]   Not the one who has the right friends or gotten a better job or saved enough money.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.200]   Not the ones who are the more organized.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   Not the ones who read more or more experiences.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:08.200]   No, those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.200]   If I was to take a survey in this room and ask how many of you are satisfied,
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:19.200]   I know, I've been talking to all of you, but I've been in ministry long enough to know
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.160]   That a large percentage of people at all times inside the church are always dissatisfied
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.380]   with something.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.080]   Some of you may express it.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.560]   Some of you keep it to yourself.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:36.640]   A majority of us live day to day unsatisfied.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.240]   Unsatisfied with our husbands.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.240]   Unsatisfied with our wives.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.340]   Unsatisfied with our children.
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:44.120]   Unsatisfied with our work.
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.340]   Unsatisfied with our circumstance.
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:48.840]   Unsatisfied with our church.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.960]   Unsatisfied with our government.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.800]   We live day to day unsatisfied.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:01.120]   Thinking that if this changes, if my marriage changes, if my children changes, if I get
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:07.080]   a better job, if I can pay off my bill, I could be satisfied.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:15.120]   But he says those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.800]   Because our satisfaction doesn't come from this world.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.640]   There's nothing that the world can do to satisfy a soul that is hungering and thirsting for
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.880]   Christ.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.220]   No amount of money.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:35.120]   Even if the Dodgers won.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.920]   It will temporarily satisfy you.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.320]   But you will have to win again.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.800]   And again and again.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:52.280]   He says those who are satisfied are those who recognize they're hungry and thirsting
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.760]   for Christ.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.520]   That's what fasting is.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.840]   We humble ourselves before God, recognizing that he is our satisfaction.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:08.440]   And so we empty ourselves of all distractions and say, "Lord, I want you."
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.980]   That's what fasting is.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:16.820]   If Christ and the gospel is nothing more than a security blanket, you don't need to do anything
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.500]   more.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.940]   You've already arrived.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:23.900]   Because you're already justified, most of you.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.540]   Because you already believe.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.500]   You're already at church.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:28.760]   You're already at Bible study.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.440]   So there's nothing more to do because you're already arrived.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:36.080]   So from this point on, everything else that you're asked to do, everything that you feel
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.140]   pressured to do, is just more.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:49.100]   But if Christ is your life, you will be hungering and thirsting until the day you meet Christ.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:55.940]   See, whatever we find the greatest joy, we want more of it.
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:14:01.220]   I've never heard somebody go to a restaurant and eat fantastic food and come out and say,
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.220]   "I've experienced that.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.900]   I will never come here again."
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.900]   No.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:05.900]   You want to come.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:06.900]   You're looking for opportunities to come.
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:09.360]   You want to invite your friends to come.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.260]   You visit some place and it's awesome.
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.380]   It's like, "Oh, I'm going to do this more."
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.700]   Because it brings great joy.
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:18.500]   It gives you rest.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:23.340]   Even if you're tired at the end of your trip, you feel rested, don't you?
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.340]   And you want to do it again.
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:25.340]   You save money.
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.340]   You sacrifice.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:30.180]   You'll work overtime in order to do it again.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:35.220]   If Christ is just your security blanket, you already have everything that you need.
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:45.860]   But when Christ is your life, you become very sensitive to sin because sin hinders you from
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.920]   this life.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:54.260]   If Christ is your life, every encumbrance that causes you in your path to Christ, you
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.860]   want to get rid of.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.700]   Sin is hindering you from life.
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:06.140]   See, fasting is for us to take a break and put aside everything and to come before the
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:10.780]   Lord and say, "You are my life.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:18.080]   I need you more than my bank account, more than my wife, more than my children.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.620]   I need you.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:22.220]   More than bread.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220]   More than food.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.540]   I need you."
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:33.980]   That's where prayer and fasting is.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:41.900]   The reason why I wanted to give this message is because our church is growing.
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.780]   And humanly speaking, the pastors and elders are overwhelmed.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:53.100]   How are we going to clean the bathroom?
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.820]   We're running out of parking.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:01.260]   We need to rip up these walls again, make more seats.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.860]   We need more people in our children's department.
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.140]   We need more of everything.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.140]   We need more counselors.
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.140]   We need more teachers.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.140]   We need more organizers.
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.940]   And yet our church keeps growing.
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:19.740]   Even if we're not doing an A+ job, the church keeps growing.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.660]   Now that's a good thing, right?
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.340]   Because God called us to gather.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.140]   He called us to make disciples of all the nations.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:32.420]   He didn't say make disciples of this many people.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.300]   But I have a growing sense of nervousness and anxiousness.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.180]   Not because the church is growing.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.260]   Not because of the numbers being filled.
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.940]   Not because we don't have enough space.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.300]   That's not where my anxiousness is.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.220]   Because we've gone through this many times before.
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.540]   And I know God will provide.
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:58.940]   The growing sense of anxiousness is we becoming more and more self-reliant.
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:06.340]   That as a church continues to grow, and we become accustomed to doing things without
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.700]   desperately hanging to God in prayer.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:17.140]   Because the worst place for a Christian to be is to be fruitful without dependence on
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:20.060]   God.
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:26.780]   That things are happening when we're not desperately hungering and thirsting for them.
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:32.420]   Because our natural tendency is to think, I know how to do this.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.540]   Because I've done it before.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.540]   And people are coming.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:43.140]   And so as a result of that, we become proud without desiring to be proud.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:49.460]   We're filled with self-reliance because we're growing.
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:55.340]   And we are more susceptible to the schemes of the devil than ever.
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:02.620]   The areas that you and I are the most weakened are the areas that you think you are the most
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:06.260]   gifted in.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:12.460]   You know, when somebody comes up here, and every one of you who is baptized, you're not
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:14.340]   used to speaking up here.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:20.380]   So you spend a lot of time prepping, going over your grammar, praying, asking for people
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:27.220]   to pray, making sure that God covers your weakness, that you don't say something heretical.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:30.100]   You are desperate.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.780]   I don't need to do that.
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.780]   I've been doing this for 35 years.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.540]   So when people ask me, do you get nervous?
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:40.780]   No, I don't get nervous.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:44.260]   So I was nervous this morning because my son was up here.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.740]   And I was nervous for him.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:52.060]   But it's in the areas that we are, what we think we're good at, is where we're the most
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.700]   vulnerable.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:19:00.560]   If you're good with money, that's where you think you don't need God's help.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:06.360]   If you're good with people, you don't need to pray because you're good at it.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.500]   If you're good at organizing, you don't need God's help.
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.660]   You can do it.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:15.760]   But that's where we are the most vulnerable.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.660]   If you think you're smart, and you're wise, and you're articulate, that's where you are
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.260]   the weakest.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:29.660]   Because we are the least dependent on the areas that we think we're good at.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:35.520]   Organizing forces us to humble ourselves and to empty ourselves and come before God and
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.820]   cry out, "I need you.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:40.820]   I need you."
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:48.940]   Let me give you some dating advice, all right, since we're at the end of the sermon.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:49.940]   Okay.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:57.380]   And those of you who aren't dating, all right, I'm going to get to you too, okay?
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.820]   We live in a culture of poking.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.340]   I don't know if you still do that on Facebook, right?
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.860]   You just kind of poke, right?
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:10.640]   And you kind of poke to see who's interested, right?
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.420]   And so it's a number game.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:17.420]   Go on the website, like dating website, and it's like, you know, poke, poke, poke, poke,
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.420]   poke.
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.740]   I poked like 15 people, and then three of them poked back, right?
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:26.340]   And they said, "Oh, I have a chance with these three."
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:29.260]   And then so you poke a little bit further, and then, "Oh, one responded.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.860]   Okay, that's the one that I have the greatest chance."
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:36.900]   And then you go out and you meet them, and then you get disappointed, right?
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:39.260]   That's the pattern that I've seen, right?
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:44.780]   And so dating in this culture is just kind of like weighing the pros and cons, and where
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:48.340]   do I have the greatest chance, and then see what works, and if it doesn't work, or they
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.800]   don't seem like, ah.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.740]   So it's like risk, you know, risk.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.020]   Basically dating today is risk management, right?
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:21:04.060]   You've learned to like how to save face, and the least risk, and the most chance, right,
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.340]   to playing the numbers game.
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:11.380]   As a father, and I'm telling you, I think all fathers will tell, will probably agree
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:16.900]   with me, don't poke, right?
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:25.100]   Because you're, if you want to date somebody, you got to make up your mind first that that's
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.740]   the one you want.
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:30.420]   Because you're not going fishing.
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:34.260]   You're not tapping to see which one's ripe, right?
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:37.940]   You're not buying a watermelon.
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:46.140]   This person that you want to date may be the mother of your child.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:51.060]   This is a person that you're going to walk with, with the rest of your life.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:56.320]   So you're not just going or just randomly seeking which you have the greatest odds.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:03.780]   You have to pray, and you have to make up your mind that that's the one that I want.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:07.740]   And so you're supposed to take a risk.
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:12.460]   You're supposed to put your neck out there so that she can say, nah.
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:18.020]   But you've made up your mind, and you're willing to win her over.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:23.940]   So don't pick a girl that you're not willing to change your hairstyle for.
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.140]   Don't pick somebody and say, God, if she doesn't like what I like, I don't like, that's not
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:28.140]   for me.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.540]   That's going to be your wife.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:32.460]   Of course you're going to change your hairstyle.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:36.680]   Pick somebody that you're willing to die for.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:41.000]   Pick somebody and then work to get that person.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:49.420]   And if she says no, stick your neck out again.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:54.020]   Oh you're clapping.
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:58.460]   But that's what dating was meant, that's what men are called to do.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:02.620]   You're supposed to pursue them, but you have to first make up your mind, is she the one
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.300]   that I want?
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:09.980]   I think because of the way that we're dating, it overflows into our marriages.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:13.460]   We're kind of like, okay, I'm going to do this, I sacrifice, so you should sacrifice.
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:20.100]   It's like, no, you're picking somebody that you're saying, I'm going to die for you.
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.380]   As Christ died for me, I'm going to die for you.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:24.900]   So you don't go pick around to see which one's ripe.
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:30.060]   No, you make up your mind, and then you commit to that.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.100]   And there's pain that comes with that.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:36.240]   You get embarrassed, humiliated, hurt.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:43.620]   But she's worth it because you've chosen her, and she has qualities that you want for the
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.140]   rest of your life.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:52.680]   So you make up your mind first before you go to her.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:59.020]   So that when you get married, and this is for married men, that you're willing to die
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:01.020]   for her.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:10.600]   Yes, change your hairstyle, wear different pants, watch different movies.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:16.760]   But we have guys who can't give up a single thing.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:22.940]   No, you're called to be her Christ.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:28.020]   How can you ask her to marry you if you're not willing to die for her?
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:29.060]   Now why do I say all this?
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:34.400]   I'm not trying to get into marriage counseling or dating counseling.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:40.880]   How much of our frustration is coming because we're poking around with Christ?
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.080]   If I do this, will he do this for me?
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.240]   If I sacrifice this, am I really going to be able to get that?
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:57.500]   And because of this fear, we're always watching Christ from a distance.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:03.700]   We get blessed by testimonies, people who talk about their love for Christ.
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:08.860]   We're always regurgitating information that other people are sharing, but it's never yours
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:14.220]   because you have not committed.
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:18.220]   You have not chosen.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:26.060]   Christ wants us to know that he gave himself for us.
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:30.900]   Now he wants us to give ourselves for him.
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:39.740]   And he is worth everything that you can possibly imagine to give up.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:45.300]   Revelation 3.20 says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:52.500]   If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and will dine with him
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.980]   and he with me."
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.460]   Notice he didn't say, "Open the door so I can just come in."
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:02.580]   He says, "Open the door so I can come in and dine with you, that I can have banquet with
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.580]   you."
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:07.340]   He said, "I came to give life and to give this life abundantly."
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:11.540]   He doesn't want you to just be justified.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.180]   He didn't just want to save you from hell.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:20.860]   He wanted to restore the life that God placed in you before sin came in.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:27.540]   He wanted you to know the joy, the everlasting joy that can only be found in the author of
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.740]   life.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:34.180]   He wasn't just offering hell insurance.
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:39.060]   He came to give life, to give this life abundantly.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:45.820]   So fasting and praying isn't just opening the door.
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:50.700]   We decide, "I'm going to start banging.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:54.320]   I'm going to be the one who's going to knock on this door.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.260]   I know what's on this other side.
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:04.860]   So I'm going to put aside all this other stuff so that I can have Christ above all."
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:10.540]   So for that end, I want to encourage all of us, including myself.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:17.600]   And I want to keep doing that because this is a big blind spot in the Western culture
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.580]   and in our church.
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:26.060]   I am so thankful that when I first became a Christian, that the people that was leading
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.340]   me were prayer warriors.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:32.740]   Their weakness was the Bible teaching was shallow.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.260]   So that was their blind spot.
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:39.060]   But man, to this day, when I think of prayer warriors, I mean, they pray.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.140]   They have prayer school.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.060]   They have prayer meetings.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.460]   And then we'd have Bible study.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.420]   And then at 10 o'clock, we would go.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:50.540]   And these are high school, young college students, from 10 to 3 in the morning, every Friday,
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.540]   every Friday.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.900]   I don't know how many times we fell asleep, and then somebody would poke us and wake us
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:58.220]   back up, and we're mumbling in our sleep.
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:02.860]   But that's how I understood what Christianity was, because that was when I first became
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:05.700]   a Christian.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:10.220]   I am not preaching this message because that's where I am.
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:15.900]   I am preaching this message because I have drifted far from that.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:21.940]   And I don't want our church to continue to go down this path.
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:31.220]   Until we pray, we cannot, we cannot ask God to bless us.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:36.100]   Because as soon as we think we are blessed, without desperately hanging to Him, we will
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:39.180]   think we did it.
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.380]   So let's pray.
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.740]   Let's commit ourselves to pray.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.340]   Let's saturate everything to pray.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:47.100]   Let's prioritize prayer.
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.860]   Let's devote ourselves to prayer.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:55.500]   And then wait and see what God will do.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:29:04.180]   Let's pray.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:14.340]   As our worship team comes up, I want to encourage you to take this time to come before the Lord
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:16.860]   and to commit yourself.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:25.300]   Lord, I want to and I need to humble myself, to empty myself.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.420]   I've been living my life independent of you.
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:33.300]   Even though I'm studying the Bible, even though I'm active at church, I've become independent
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:34.300]   without prayer.
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:39.500]   Lord, I desperately need you.
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:53.900]   So as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to petition the Lord in our prayer.

[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:31.900]   I desire and I long to worship thee.
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:39.900]   I want you, I want you more than gold or silver.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:47.900]   Only you can satisfy.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:35:00.900]   You alone are the real joy giver and the apple of my eye.
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:02.900]   [MUSIC]
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:09.900]   You alone are my strength, my cheer.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:19.900]   To you alone may my spirit yearn.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:27.900]   You alone are my heart's desire and
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:33.900]   I long to worship you.
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:41.900]   And I long to worship you.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:45.900]   Let's pray.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.900]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:51.900]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:54.900]   He leads me besides quiet waters.
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.900]   He restores my soul.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.900]   He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:04.900]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:08.900]   I fear no evil for you are with me.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.900]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:15.900]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.900]   You have anointed my head with oil.
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.900]   My cup overflows.
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.900]   Surely goodness and loving kindness will follow me all the days of my life.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.900]   And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:33.900]   Lord, help us that this would be our true confession.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:37.900]   That you are my shepherd, you are our shepherd,
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:41.900]   and that we would desire nothing else and nothing more.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:44.900]   We pray, Father God, as you send us,
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:48.900]   that you would allow us, give us the strength to be the aroma of Christ.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:52.900]   That we would commit ourselves to pray and seek your face.
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.900]   So that you can hear us.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.900]   That you would forgive us.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.900]   And that you would heal our land.
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:02.900]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:08.900]   God sent his Son.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:14.900]   They called him Jesus.
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:19.900]   He came to love.
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:25.900]   Heal and forgive.
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:30.900]   He lived and died.
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:36.900]   True by my body.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:47.900]   An empty grave is there to my Savior lives.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:57.900]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:08.900]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:19.900]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:31.900]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:34.900]   Amen.
