[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - The end, chapter three.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   And as you make your way over there,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.160]   I do wanna give you a bit of a background.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.000]   This passage, we're jumping in right in the middle
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.320]   of a long argument.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.480]   And the argument that Apostle Paul is making
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.760]   is to the church that's divided, okay?
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.520]   Apostle Paul is not only making an argument,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.920]   but he's making a heartfelt appeal.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.280]   This is a church that he loves.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.080]   This is a church that's dear to his heart.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.720]   This is a church where he probably spent
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.520]   the most amount of time,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.360]   probably close to about two years.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.320]   As you know, Apostle Paul,
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.600]   through his missionary journeys,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.420]   there are churches that he didn't even spend
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.240]   three months there, but he established leaders
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.840]   and he would entrust them into their hands.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.000]   And Apostle Paul particularly loved this church,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.040]   entrusting it to other teachers, other qualified men,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.640]   checking up on it, and so on and so forth.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.980]   But this church that he loved started to have division
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.720]   when men in their arrogance and pride
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.400]   started to lift up other men.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.560]   And you're thinking, why in the world,
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.500]   if you're prideful, why would you lift up another man?
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440]   Because sometimes if you lift up a leader
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.800]   and you say, I'm with that guy,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.600]   you're sharing the man's glory.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.880]   And so what's been happening is,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.840]   they've been saying, I'm of Apollos, I'm of Paul,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.480]   I'm of this person, I'm of that person,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.880]   and becoming prideful.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.000]   And in pride, there is always division.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.840]   So this divided church, Apostle Paul is teaching them.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060]   What is this pride, what is this arrogance,
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.740]   what is this division?
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.380]   And in teaching, he's been giving metaphors.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.340]   So I'm gonna read to you a lengthy passage
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.740]   starting from chapter three, verse one,
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.100]   down to verse 15, where he gives metaphors
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.500]   to describe why they need to grow up
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.740]   and change their attitude of pride
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.200]   and division in the church.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.060]   It says here, "And I, brethren,
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.340]   "could not speak to you as spiritual men,
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.780]   "but as to men of flesh,
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.500]   "as to infants in Christ.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.700]   "I gave you milk to drink and not solid food,
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.700]   "for you were not able to receive it.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520]   "Indeed, even now you're not able,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.640]   "for you are still fleshly.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.560]   "For since there is jealousy and strife among you,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.400]   "are you not fleshly?
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.200]   "And are you not walking like mere men?
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.280]   "For when one says, I'm of Paul,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.720]   "and another says, I'm of Apollos,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.100]   "are you not mere men?
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.120]   "What then is Apollos, and what is Paul,
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000]   "servants through whom you believed,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.880]   "even as the Lord gave opportunity to each?
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.360]   "I planted Apollos' water,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.560]   "but God was causing the growth.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.140]   "So then, neither the one who plants
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.200]   "nor the one who waters is anything,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.840]   "but God who causes the growth.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.500]   "Now, he who plants and he who waters are one,
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.380]   "but each will receive his own reward
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.520]   "according to his own labor.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.460]   "For we are God's fellow workers,
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.580]   "you are God's field, God's building."
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.680]   So he's describing to them,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.500]   this jealousy and strife among you,
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.140]   this is fleshly, this is not of Christ,
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.280]   you guys are like babies, right, grow up.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.000]   And he gives the example of gardening
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.280]   to explain why they need to grow.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.700]   Now we come to our section
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.320]   that we're going to be studying today,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.120]   verses 10 through 15.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.340]   "According to the grace of God which was given to me,
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.860]   "like a wise master builder,
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.400]   "I laid a foundation, and another is building on it.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.220]   "But each man must be careful how he builds on it,
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.040]   "for no man can lay a foundation
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.860]   "other than the one that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.760]   "Now, if any man build on a foundation
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.380]   "with gold, silver, precious stones,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.400]   "wood, hay, or straw,
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.240]   "each man's work will become evident,
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.260]   "for the day will show it
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.720]   "because it is to be revealed with fire.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.600]   "And the fire itself will test the quality
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.200]   "of each man's work.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.560]   "If any man's work which is built on it remains,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.140]   "he will receive a reward.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.240]   "If any man's work is burnt up,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.500]   "he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved,
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.780]   "yet so as through fire."
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.540]   Let's pray for the Lord's blessing.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.980]   Heavenly Father, as Apostle Paul is instructing the church,
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.820]   I pray, Father Lord, that we as a church
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.300]   would have open ears to receive.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.980]   God, truly as your children, help us to receive your word
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.640]   with great anticipation and eagerness
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.700]   to apply into our lives.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.060]   God, help us to be focused, help us to be attentive.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.180]   More than anything, Lord,
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.020]   give us the conviction through the Spirit.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.900]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.300]   Now, to introduce this passage a little bit more,
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.780]   this is a passage that we've been studying
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.860]   in First Corinthians in our Thursday Bible study,
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.720]   and this is the next passage we've come across.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.420]   How many of you guys have been keeping an eye
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.720]   on the real estate market?
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.760]   It's crazy right now.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.740]   If any of you guys are at all
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.900]   looking at the real estate market, it's going nuts.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.340]   People are buying homes, prices are inflating like crazy,
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.980]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.240]   Well, for me, I don't know if you guys knew,
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.260]   but I actually had a real estate license when I was younger.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.060]   So I always kind of keep a tab on it
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.300]   'cause I'm really interested.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.580]   I also like home improvement
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.700]   and this whole do-it-yourself stuff.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.460]   And there is this TV show that I watched a few episodes
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.700]   called Flip or Flop, okay?
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.420]   So some of you guys have seen it.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.120]   It's entertaining, it's super entertaining,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.500]   but all the people are doing is,
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.220]   there's this couple, young couple,
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.560]   with a little baby daughter.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.940]   They're real estate agents.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.560]   But they go and buy these beat up homes,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.160]   these distressed homes or homes
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.220]   that are now owned by the banks or whatever.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.540]   And they'll put it down, and then what their plan is,
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.020]   is we're gonna fix this thing, we're gonna flip it,
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.260]   and we're gonna make a profit.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.060]   So it's pretty exciting because all of a sudden,
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.380]   they go in there and they're like,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.020]   ooh, we're gonna put granite countertops.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.620]   And it's pretty hilarious 'cause the wife,
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.460]   they're not even gonna live in there.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.020]   She's like, no, I want quartz.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.300]   I want this kind of cabinet.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.900]   She's like, no, we have to go big.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.480]   And it's pretty funny, so that's all entertaining.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.920]   And it's entertaining too because once they fix it up,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.560]   it's that wow factor.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.440]   The buyers come in, they're like, wow, big kitchen.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.080]   And people are into that stuff.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.440]   But the other appeal of the TV show is because
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.640]   there's the risk, so here's the conflict.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.800]   The risk is, you buy a home and you're like, awesome.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.840]   This thing has so much square footage.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.600]   They buy it and it's like, it's not permitted.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.640]   You gotta break it down.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.280]   Like, what?
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   They'll buy a home and all of a sudden there's mold
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.080]   and mold problems are crazy.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.580]   They'll buy a home and basically the people
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.360]   have ripped out stuff like appliances.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.060]   They'll buy a home and anything can go wrong.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.820]   So they're sitting here like, oh my God, oh my God,
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.460]   we just put down our life savings into this thing.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.520]   What are we gonna do?
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.620]   Well, I give you that example because
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.080]   the passages that we read masterfully
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.000]   according to the scriptures,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.960]   the church and the building up of the church
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.720]   and the work that Apostle Paul and the teachers
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.360]   at that time are doing is described by metaphorically
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.240]   a construction site, a building, right?
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.080]   And the thing about it is I just wanna give you
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.880]   the main point at the very beginning of the sermon.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.640]   It's essentially the building up of the church
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.400]   and the construction of the church is a lot like
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.800]   taking a risk on the home.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.480]   Sometimes there's great potential.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.980]   Sometimes there's exciting things.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.720]   Sometimes it's like, wow, I can't believe we've come so far
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.000]   and I can't believe it looks this way
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.200]   and there's amazement.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.880]   But isn't it the truth that sometimes there are surprises?
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.960]   Not only surprises but there's hidden mold, so to speak.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.280]   There are problems that's been unattended to
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.680]   for a long time and now that they're trying to sell it,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.640]   it's like, oh my goodness.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.360]   Or you make great, great investments
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.460]   but there's nothing really that comes out of it.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.280]   So in thinking about the building in this way,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.680]   Apostle Paul gives a commandment.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.520]   Apostle Paul gives an exhortation.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.360]   And the exhortation is simple.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.260]   In building up of the church, it must be done carefully.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.880]   In building up of the church, it must be done carefully.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   That's his point.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.380]   He says, basically, do it right.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.080]   Do it according to the way God wants.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.600]   Do it with precision.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.960]   Do it with accuracy.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.200]   Make it last.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.480]   Don't do the shoddy job that a lot of homes have
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.920]   where the inside structure is rotten.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.560]   Where the roof is leaking but you just put
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.240]   a little asphalt shingle on there.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.520]   It's this thin little thing and it just covers it up.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.840]   A little layer of paint.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.340]   Just do it carefully.
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.760]   But you know, there's another appeal to the TV show
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.520]   and there's another point that Apostle Paul makes
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.140]   was perhaps even more important, more crucial.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.340]   Which is, with all that risk, that's a scary thing.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.720]   You put down a couple hundred thousand dollars on a home
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.040]   and you could end up losing it.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.940]   Why take the risk?
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.580]   Well, see, the other appeal of the home is they make money.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.760]   There's payoff.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   There's reward.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.460]   So at the end of every episode, and it's kind of funny
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.280]   because you'd imagine each episode looks exactly the same.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.680]   It's like, here's this junky house.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.680]   Fix it up.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.520]   Sell it.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.340]   Wow.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.080]   And then they do, dun dun dun dun dun.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.600]   The figures, right?
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.680]   They have a dramatic chart and they try to make it
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.320]   as dramatic as possible.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.640]   The guy's like, we put in 200 grand in this home.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.360]   We spent $50,000 renovating and $20,000 went into
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.240]   closing costs.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.760]   And it's like, whoa, that's a lot of money.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.400]   But in two months they made 100 grand
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.280]   'cause they sold it over $500,000.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.000]   And it's like, $100,000 in two months?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.080]   And that's why people watch.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.920]   It's like, that's crazy.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.280]   That's more than my one year salary.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.880]   For some of you guys, more than multiple year salary.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.560]   And then for you college students, like, dang,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.720]   I don't even know what time it is.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.680]   Like, I'm in that much debt, you know?
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.080]   So that's the draw, right?
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.920]   It's like, they made a reward in that short amount of time
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.120]   because they took that kind of risk
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.440]   and made that kind of investment.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.360]   Apostle Paul, if you didn't catch it, but in this passage,
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.080]   my second point, which I'm gonna give you
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   at the beginning of the sermon, is why take the risk?
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.780]   Why do that amount of work?
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.960]   Why invest yourself that much?
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.200]   It's because there is great reward.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.400]   So Apostle Paul says, invest carefully
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.480]   because there is great reward.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.800]   Invest carefully because there is great reward.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.040]   So that's the two part of the lesson today.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.800]   Let's begin by looking at verse 10.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.160]   By looking at verse 10.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.880]   Again, Apostle Paul masterfully is trying to give
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.520]   a metaphor of the church, trying to prescribe to us
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.360]   the reality of the situation.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.680]   But remember, in the back of your mind,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.360]   he is rebuking something very specific here.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.840]   It's the arrogant thinking of man
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.880]   and it's the division that's caused by it.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.160]   The arrogant thinking of man
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.680]   and the division that's caused by it.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.520]   And so let's begin here.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.080]   In verse 10, he says, according to the grace of God
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.080]   which was given to me, like a wise master builder,
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.360]   I laid a foundation, and another is building on it.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.440]   But each man must be careful how he must build on it.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.560]   As we pay attention to the beginning portion of that,
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.200]   we just realize Apostle Paul is giving
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.600]   a reality description of himself.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.360]   He describes himself as an individual
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.480]   who has been graced by God to do a work.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.360]   He describes himself as an individual
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.000]   who is laying a foundation to a structure,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.120]   and he's describing himself as an individual
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.280]   who is doing that, but ultimately he's going to be replaced
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.960]   by individuals who will build on top of the foundation
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.880]   that he laid, okay?
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.560]   Why am I describing that?
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.040]   Because if you think about that whole situation then,
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.800]   he is not thinking of himself as the master architect
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.040]   that has designed, executes, and fulfills the whole plan.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.280]   He sees himself as a part of God's bigger plan.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.360]   Then what is he then?
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.600]   He's a worker on the construction crew.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.080]   And if you notice what I read in the previous passage,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.000]   that is exactly the way he viewed himself.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   He viewed himself on equal plane with the other servants.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.640]   If you look at the other part, he says in verse five,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.360]   what then is Apollos and what is Paul?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.880]   Servants through whom you believed
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.360]   even as the Lord did what?
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.480]   Gave them an opportunity.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.120]   God hired us.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.660]   We are just instruments.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.760]   Instruments on the team.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.320]   Is the one who's laying the foundation
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.760]   that much more important than the guy
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.780]   who's building the structure
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.200]   and the guy who's building the structure
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.640]   that much more important than the roofer
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.120]   and the roofer more important than the guy
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.040]   who's doing the electricals
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.760]   and the electricals more than the finishers?
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.260]   He's saying we're just one.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.360]   We're like all on the same plane.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.400]   So going back to this idea,
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.440]   these men sitting here lifting up Apollos
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.480]   and saying he's our teacher, he is our leader.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.840]   Apostle Paul is like, what are you guys doing?
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.040]   Who are we but servants?
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.340]   Who are we but hired men?
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.120]   Who are we but instruments in the hands of the Lord?
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.440]   Stop it.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.800]   Knock it off.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.440]   But as he's saying that, we realize
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.880]   Apostle Paul is teaching us
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.720]   to have a very humble perspective about himself.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:13.320]   He understands the success of the building.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.720]   He understands the strength of the building.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.040]   He understands that essentially,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.400]   when it comes down to it,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.760]   the core of this entire project, it's not him.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.360]   What does he say in verse seven?
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.240]   In verse seven, this is one that has rebuked me,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.560]   sobered me up, and caused me to examine myself.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.520]   So then, neither the one who plants
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.500]   or the one who waters is anything,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.940]   but God who causes the growth.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.080]   We are nothing, God is everything.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   What is or what are these metaphors trying to emphasize?
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.760]   What is the emphatic point of giving this illustration?
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.720]   We're just servants.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.720]   God is all.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.560]   Stop this arrogant competing with each other.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.520]   Stop this divisiveness over who you're following,
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.560]   who you're identifying with.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.160]   Stop that.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.520]   We are humble servants.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.480]   God is everything.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.440]   So that's his humble perspective.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.840]   Now, in having this humble perspective,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.980]   he gives this admonition, this charge,
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.960]   that you must be careful how you build on it.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.080]   And so, if you think about it, on one sense,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.280]   you could fall off the fence.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.920]   We are nothing.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.640]   And so, what we do isn't significant.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.920]   Who are we?
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.880]   And there are a lot of people who sometimes think like that.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.060]   It's like, I'm nothing, I've got nothing to provide,
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.960]   I've got nothing to offer, I've got nothing to contribute,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.040]   why even try, kind of mentality, right?
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.920]   Now, against that, Apostle Paul says, no.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.720]   We are all one, but we have a task given by the master.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.320]   We have a task given by the savior.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.440]   And so, in as much as I have a specific role,
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.040]   which Apostle Paul understands,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.840]   I am a foundation-laying individual.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.040]   I go on my missionary journey,
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.340]   I convert people, and I establish the church,
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.840]   but he's moving on, he's laying the foundation,
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.760]   and then he entrusts other men to come
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.800]   and build on top of that, and he doesn't sit here
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.000]   and be like, hey, that's my foundation.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.520]   Don't you build on that.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.460]   No, he understands his role, right?
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.760]   But in so doing, he gives the admonition,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.500]   you must build carefully.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.180]   You must know your task, and you must execute
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.100]   in the way God desires.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.300]   You know, I'm gonna be giving nonstop illustrations
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.140]   of housing and stuff, so if that stuff bores you,
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.100]   I'm sorry, okay?
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.080]   But do you know that in Southern California especially,
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.840]   because you have to build things according to code.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.820]   There is earthquake code, there's code for everything.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.040]   You need permits.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.720]   You wanna remodel your kitchen to extend something, permit.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.920]   You wanna build an outdoor patio thing
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.320]   with a cover over it, permit.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.440]   And if you don't, just like I mentioned before,
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.680]   guess what happens?
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.920]   You either need to pay big bucks to get somebody in there
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.560]   and permit that thing, or you just gotta tear it down.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.100]   You do.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.940]   So it's pretty crazy.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.760]   It's actually really annoying for a lot of people, right?
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.560]   But the fact of the matter is, you have to build carefully.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.320]   Because there's danger if you don't,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.960]   and people are living in it.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.120]   And so Apostle Paul gives this charge to the people.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.360]   Yes, he is charging the people who are teaching.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.120]   Yes, he is charging the people like himself
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.080]   that we must build carefully.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.920]   But the fact of the matter also is that charge
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.840]   is for the whole church.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.820]   Whatever you're contributing to the church,
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.120]   you must do carefully, okay?
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.200]   No matter how, whether it's small or big,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.400]   your contribution, the amount of energy, time, service,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.760]   you do, whether it's large or small,
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.000]   it must be done carefully.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.480]   And so he describes it in the next verse.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.080]   How so?
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.580]   Let's take a look at verse 11.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:57.720]   In verse 11 he says, "For no man can lay a foundation
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.260]   "other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.880]   Well, there we have it.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.860]   First and foremost, you are allowed to just lay
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.920]   whatever foundation you want.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.120]   You are allowed to give the church a new vision,
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.800]   a new mission statement, and say,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.600]   "This is what we're gonna be all about."
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.720]   Okay?
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.200]   That's the point here.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.680]   Not only that, more specifically, remember,
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.760]   if the problem is they are elevating men,
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.900]   you cannot build a church upon men.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.480]   Sad state of affairs for the church.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.440]   You look at recent history, you look at long history.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.200]   The church has many times built itself around personalities
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.700]   and the authority of men.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.760]   What has come of that?
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.000]   History will teach you.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.220]   That will crumble.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.580]   It will crumble.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.200]   But the sad state of affairs is not only just personalities
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   and historical figures, but the church in its history
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   has built itself upon other shaky foundation.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.760]   For example, just morality and ethics.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.760]   Maybe just Christian ethics.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.600]   A lot of times I'll be driving down
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   and on my way to my house,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   or to where I'm living right now,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.800]   there are churches that put up big old billboards.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.560]   And I find that kind of interesting in and of itself.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.480]   But there was this one church
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.780]   that put up a big old building that says,
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.720]   "Come check this out, where genuine people meet."
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.700]   So what's the selling point of that church?
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.920]   In our church, we're all about being real.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.440]   We're gonna be genuine.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.880]   Which I'm like, good, we should be genuine.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.800]   We shouldn't be fake.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.840]   But to say the attraction of our church
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.240]   is that we're practicing this kind of ethic,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.160]   even that, although yes, it's true, you should be genuine,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.660]   that is not a sure foundation.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.400]   But you know, people have wanted so eagerly
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.200]   to build themselves upon that kind of foundation.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.240]   And again, we can go on.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.600]   Churches have built itself on history,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.560]   history and tradition, culture.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.880]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.680]   and yesterday night we had dinner for six
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.780]   and had a great talking about the same topic.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.180]   A church, as the Bible talks about it,
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.260]   is the building of God, and it's supposed to be so strong
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.480]   that not even the gates of hell will overcome it, right?
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.060]   But if you look at history,
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.460]   many churches have split, fallen, closed its doors.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.500]   What gives?
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:28.580]   Perhaps over time, their foundation was never on Christ.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.580]   Perhaps over time, they did not give attention
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.060]   to build carefully on the foundations of Christ.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.060]   Rather, all these peripherals,
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.820]   rather all these weak foundations of people,
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.820]   of celebrities, of movements, programs.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.680]   If the churches build on that, it will fall.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.480]   Just like if an individual,
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.500]   if a single person built themselves upon the foundation,
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.300]   that's not Christ.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.700]   They will never stay in the church.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.880]   They will never stay in church.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.340]   If a person comes to church because they think,
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.860]   I just need to go to a biblical church,
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.140]   I came, found biblical teaching, and so good, I'm here.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.820]   Is that enough?
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.700]   If a person thinks, I just need to go to a church
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.820]   where my family can grow,
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.700]   I just need to go to a church where I can advance this,
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.180]   and that, is that enough of a foundation to keep you here?
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.140]   Absolutely not, absolutely not.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.660]   Paul says, be careful how you build, how you build.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.040]   Now, as we think about this,
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.140]   let's take a look a little bit more into what he says.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:43.260]   In verse 12, he describes more about how
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.540]   carefully we should build.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.440]   And he says, now if any man builds on a foundation
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.900]   with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, and straw,
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.900]   each man's work will become evident.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.380]   Okay, each man's work will become evident.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.060]   He told us just a moment ago that the foundation
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.380]   just can't be any kind of foundation,
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.900]   but the foundation must be Christ.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.460]   What is he talking about with this metaphorical talk
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.860]   of gold and silver and hay and straw?
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.420]   Well, before we ask, what is that, you know?
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.620]   'Cause it's good for us to find out,
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.020]   how does that connect to our life?
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.500]   Like, what would be something that I do
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.300]   placed in the category of gold?
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.980]   What would be something that I do
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.340]   placed in the category of straw, right?
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.620]   But before we ask that, we just ask,
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.620]   what is this general point by listing all this stuff?
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.280]   Well, the point is this.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.360]   There are degrees of quality.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.020]   If you're gonna be building a building,
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.620]   you can use weak material,
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.420]   or you can use strong material that'll last.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.460]   You can build stuff with that, you know,
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.440]   glued together plywood and all that sawdust stuff,
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.860]   where you throw water on it, it's just like,
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.220]   (gurgles) and it just becomes a sponge.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.080]   Or you can actually build with strong, hard wood, right?
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.320]   Likewise, he's saying, when you build,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.880]   there's different quality of work.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.100]   Now, there's a point I want to draw from that.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.020]   And for me, I just thought, wow, this is very sobering
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.340]   and very different from how I normally think.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.020]   Does it make you feel weird if I say,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.740]   in the Christian faith, there are different degrees
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.080]   of quality of work, and that you will be examined for it?
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:37.340]   It's a weird thing to say, but as a pastor, I give sermons.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.300]   It would be strange if I gave you guys all, like,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.740]   sermon surveys and be like, did you like that one?
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.740]   (laughs)
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.460]   What did you like about it, and what did you not?
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.980]   And did you learn, did you, you know,
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.860]   was I doing anything weird in my presentation
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.580]   in terms of the pastor, did you understand?
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.340]   That might actually be good, right?
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:59.180]   But imagine not just sermon giving, but for you guys,
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.740]   your service at church, your attendance at church,
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.940]   your participation.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:10.500]   Do you realize that there is a concept here given
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.100]   in which there are different degrees
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.240]   by which you are building the church?
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.380]   And I'm now making the preliminary point
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.540]   that in the Bible, there is a truth principle
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.300]   that says once you are a believer, what you do matters
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.700]   to such a degree, you are going to be examined for it.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:33.140]   How you participate, how you contribute to your local body
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.180]   is going to vary in degree of excellence and quality,
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.340]   and you are going to be held accountable for it.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.220]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.800]   It's a little weird and awkward, actually,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.400]   to think about it in first cursory view.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.340]   But think about this, for those of you who are students,
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.860]   you never take a class where there's absolutely
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.980]   no exam and no assignments, and no grade.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.340]   For those of you guys who are working,
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.700]   if you are responsible for a project,
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.300]   you better be sure you're going to be giving a report.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.140]   Are you not?
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:08.380]   But for some odd reason, sometimes we just assume
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.700]   in the Christian faith, there isn't that same level
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.580]   of accountability.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.520]   But Apostle Paul is giving a realistic snapshot
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.940]   of spiritual reality that yes, we are children of God
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.780]   in his house, yes, we are also priests in his temple,
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.260]   yes, we are also, though, instruments, workers
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.940]   in his church, building up this building of God.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.140]   And the quality of work to which we are building
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.520]   is going to be examined.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.480]   That is a teaching of Scripture, and it's sobering.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.620]   It's really sobering.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:44.940]   Has God not given us commands to evangelize the lost?
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.260]   Has God not given us commands to preach?
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.700]   Has God not given us the command to serve the needy,
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.100]   to meet the needs of the people around us?
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.180]   Hasn't he given us commands to examine every spirit?
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.700]   I can go on in terms of the commandments he's given
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.180]   for us to keep within the church.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.360]   Do you know, do you realize,
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.820]   that there's going to be an examination of that?
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.260]   And we're going to be held accountable.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.180]   And so he says earlier, even earlier on in verse eight,
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.300]   he says, "Now he who plants and he who waters is one."
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.480]   We're all on the same team.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   We're all pursuing Christ's master plan.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.140]   We're all pursuing the same goal, the same result.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.860]   So we're one, right?
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.340]   And we've been given, essentially, equal footing
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.700]   to work in this church.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.140]   But then look what he says, second half of verse eight,
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.300]   "But each one will receive his own reward
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.100]   "according to his own labor."
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.260]   That is an interesting truth.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.140]   Go to another passage, which is really important,
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:51.140]   for us, and the passage is 2 Corinthians.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.900]   Oh no, my page is getting mixed up.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.240]   2 Corinthians.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.620]   Oh, sorry, sorry, 1 Corinthians.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.980]   Sorry, my page is getting a little mixed up.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:12.280]   Okay, we're gonna go to 1 Corinthians chapter four.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.220]   Okay.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.580]   1 Corinthians chapter four.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.420]   (pages flipping)
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.460]   And in 1 Corinthians chapter four,
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.780]   starting from verse four, he says this.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.660]   He says, "I am conscious of nothing against myself,
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.960]   "yet I am not by this acquitted.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.920]   "But the one who examines me is the Lord.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.260]   "Therefore, do not go on passing judgment before the time,
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.800]   "but wait until the Lord comes,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.580]   "who will bring forth to light the things
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.660]   "hidden in the darkness,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.320]   "and disclose the motives of men's hearts.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.180]   "And then each man's praise will come to him
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.460]   "from God."
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.580]   What does he say?
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.580]   He first essentially says,
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.340]   "I'm gonna be examined by the Lord himself."
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.180]   Right?
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.260]   So he's gonna try his best so that his conscience
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.140]   is not bothered, so that he himself is not sitting there
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.320]   like, "Oh, shoot, I know I slacked off.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.220]   "I know I didn't do this.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.720]   "I know I didn't do that right.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.540]   "And maybe I might get found out."
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.940]   His conscience is clear, but even though his conscience
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.100]   is clear, he says, "I'm not acquitted."
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:07.920]   Why?
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.420]   "'Cause God's still gonna judge me.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.180]   "He's going to examine me."
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.180]   Right?
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.260]   And please pay attention to the way I use those words,
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.460]   judge and examine, okay?
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.700]   Right now I'm using that in way of examination,
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.980]   in way of test.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.740]   Going back to our text, in verse 13,
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.520]   he says very clearly, "Each man's work will be evident,
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.640]   "but the fact of the matter is,
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.080]   "it's not going to be evident just because time passes.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.400]   "It's going to be tested."
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.220]   He says, "For the day will show it,
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.980]   "because it is to be revealed by fire.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.840]   "And the fire itself will test
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.060]   "the quality of each man's work."
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.660]   Is that not sobering to you guys?
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.820]   I hope it is.
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:53.780]   It's not as though, here you are, just doing your thing.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.540]   Going to church, participating as you can,
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.500]   and then time will just go on,
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.180]   and time will just keep going on,
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.460]   and at the very end, when Jesus Christ comes,
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.640]   then there's gonna be judgment.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.700]   That's not the picture he's giving, right?
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.060]   There's going to be an active examination and testing
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.380]   of the quality of your contribution to the church.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.260]   And I want you guys to think about that.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.100]   Jeremiah, chapter 17, verse 10,
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.020]   I'll reference this for you.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.000]   It says, "I, the Lord, search the heart.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.240]   "I test the mind, even to give to each man
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.380]   "according to his ways,
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.580]   "according to the results of his deeds."
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.340]   Okay?
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.780]   According to the results of his deeds.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.380]   So by way of application,
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.620]   I'm gonna do a long, extended application here for you guys.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.980]   Number one, do you first realize that,
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.820]   although Apostle Paul is talking about church planting,
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.100]   teaching, laying the foundations,
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.180]   he is still talking to the whole church.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.020]   Why?
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.460]   Because he says, "Every man,"
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.980]   that includes every one of you,
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.420]   "Every man is going to stand before Christ
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.460]   "to give an account of what he has done."
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.000]   Right?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.820]   So first and foremost, do you understand
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.300]   that even if you're not on the pulpit,
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.380]   even if you're not an elder,
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.060]   even if you're not a deacon,
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.020]   you contribute to the building of the church.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.220]   Right?
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.900]   Now I'm asked an important question.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.860]   What's gold?
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.700]   What's silver?
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.520]   What's straw?
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.020]   What's hay?
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.780]   I don't know, I can't,
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.900]   I don't know what gold and what straw and what hay would be.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.660]   But Apostle Paul describes something,
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.140]   and the passage I read to you in Jeremiah
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.300]   describes you something,
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.100]   that God is going to examine everything about your deeds.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.260]   Let me read to you this passage one more time.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.940]   "I, the Lord, search the heart,
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.100]   "I test the mind,
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.000]   "and I give to each man according to his way,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.340]   "and according to the results of his deeds."
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.340]   What does that mean?
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.740]   Every aspect of your deed on earth is going to be examined.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.420]   So, some tangible things.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.260]   For me as a pastor,
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.460]   if I, you know,
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.780]   if I don't really care about my sermon,
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.060]   if I feel confident about my speaking ability,
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.300]   so I slap together something,
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.420]   I don't ever pray about it,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.180]   and I just don't even think about what you need,
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.860]   I don't think, I don't care about how it comes off,
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.180]   and I just put it together,
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.300]   as long as you come up to me and say,
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.580]   "Thank you for the sermon, Pastor."
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.500]   I'm like, "Cool."
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.020]   I'm going to be judged,
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.980]   not just simply because my sermon was shoddy,
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.900]   but my motivation, my preparation.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.580]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.060]   But you know, if you're a member of the church,
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.820]   maybe you're not serving right now,
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.940]   but your commitment level to participate
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.860]   in the life of the church is shoddy.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.980]   You're not preparing.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.360]   You're not really thinking about the people.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.700]   So, you stiff-arm people,
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.180]   you don't get engaged in the people,
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.460]   you don't engage in the Bible study,
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.500]   you don't engage in the sermons,
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.500]   you blow it off whenever something comes up.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.340]   Guess what?
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.700]   That contributes to the building up of the church.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.660]   It contributes because you're destroying the church.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.540]   You're creating an atmosphere, a context,
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.780]   essentially, functionally, the church
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.620]   is functioning by the same parameters
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.460]   and the degree of devotion you have.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.420]   Do you see that?
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.580]   So, my first point is, every single one of us,
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:07.020]   no matter to what depth, to what task we're engaged,
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.140]   you are all a part of building up the church.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.580]   And the fact of the matter is,
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.540]   this passage is teaching us that from the beginning,
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.340]   the motivation, to the execution, to how you do it,
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.700]   it's all going to be examined.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.500]   It's all going to be examined.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:28.340]   So, Apostle Paul says, "Be careful."
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.540]   Be careful how you do it.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.420]   Be careful how you build.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.580]   Give careful attention.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.620]   Are you doing it according to the way God desires?
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.020]   Are you doing it according to the way
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.420]   God has planned for you in the scriptures?
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.780]   You know, I just want to, you know,
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.820]   for us to have an application
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.140]   that's transforming the way we think.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.620]   There is something that's been said frequently
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.260]   in recent times that has been bothering me a little bit.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.420]   And it's grounded in the right thing,
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.540]   but I think executed poorly.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.660]   Which is this phrase.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.940]   Some people have said,
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:07.860]   nothing you can do can make God love you more,
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:12.220]   and likewise, nothing you can do can make God love you less.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.060]   Right?
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:17.220]   Nothing you can do will make God more pleased in you,
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.300]   and nothing you can do can make him less pleased with you.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.540]   Positionally, it's true.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.520]   In the gospel, that's true.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.680]   There's literally nothing that you did
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.940]   that has effectuated something in God
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.580]   to save you and love you and pour out his grace to you.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.420]   Right?
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.900]   Positionally, that's not true.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.420]   But the reason why I say I'm bothered by it,
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.460]   'cause I'm thinking about it, and practically speaking,
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.060]   for your life as a Christian, it's kind of useless.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:46.180]   Because it leads you to think that your actions
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.820]   don't matter as it relates to your relationship with God.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.780]   This passage, is that what it teaches?
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.020]   Absolutely not.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.660]   Let me make this case to you.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.240]   If you are a genuine convert,
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.200]   you've been genuinely reconciled with God,
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.840]   and you are truly a child of the Lord,
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.200]   if you've really received the grace of the Lord
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.480]   in your life, guess what?
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.840]   Now, everything you do matters infinitely more.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.080]   Right?
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.880]   Now, every action, every thought, every word,
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.360]   all of a sudden, matters incredibly more.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.440]   Isn't that what Christ said?
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.160]   Even careless words are held accountable for.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.700]   And especially now that you're a believer,
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.960]   now that you have the spirit, it matters even that much more.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.140]   So practically speaking, again,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.840]   for every single person in the church,
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.300]   you are contributing to the life of the body.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.700]   You are building the building upon top of the foundation
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.780]   of the teaching of the apostles.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.860]   Take care to which how you build.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.180]   Give careful attention to how you walk in here,
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.020]   how you participate, how you engage
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.420]   with your brothers and sisters.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.540]   Take care to how you speak.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.680]   Are you speaking as to the words of God?
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.020]   Take care to how you counsel.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.160]   Take care of how you minister to people.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.080]   Take care how you build this church,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.520]   particularly here at Berean.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.700]   You need to take care.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.320]   You know, there's another thing I wanna challenge us with.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.640]   By way of application of this whole challenge to take care,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.360]   there is a temptation for everybody,
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.800]   and I'll confess, for me too,
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.280]   to settle for what is less than best.
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.500]   Okay?
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.220]   There are appropriate things in life
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.020]   for which you should settle, okay?
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.380]   Some people never wanna settle on their grades.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.260]   Some people never wanna settle on the car
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.820]   that they dreamed of.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:39.540]   Some people never wanna settle on a, you know,
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.760]   a lady friend. (laughs)
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.080]   There are certain things where it's only appropriate
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.520]   to a certain degree in which you should settle, okay?
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.900]   Obviously, there are things which you never settle,
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.220]   but there is always a temptation to settle.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.520]   There is.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.620]   Even when you have great intentions.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.620]   You know, I came into ministry with this huge intention
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.760]   to build up the church and preach the Bible,
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.360]   and I wanted to be gung-ho, and I really wanted to.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.280]   So when I graduated seminary, you know,
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.200]   I was thinking, yeah, maybe I'll just go apply
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.620]   to different positions.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.320]   Maybe I'll take another pastoral position,
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.320]   and where some opportunities open, you know?
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.580]   And at the time, I just wasn't in a situation
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.840]   where I could be plugged into Berean.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.400]   But I just sat there thinking, like, wait a minute,
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.360]   what do I wanna accomplish, okay?
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.040]   What do I wanna accomplish?
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.140]   And I knew I wanted to accomplish
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.540]   exactly what our vision statement said.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.560]   I wanna build up a church that honors God.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.680]   We might not, like, you know, full confidence be there,
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.140]   but we're just, our trajectory and our goal is that.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.060]   Honoring God first.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.160]   I wanna devote myself to building a church
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.180]   that's gonna be centered on the word of God,
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.600]   teaching and applying appropriately, accurately,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.620]   precisely what the Bible said, right?
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.120]   I wanted to accomplish exactly
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.280]   what the vision statement of the church said.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.840]   So I just decided, I don't need to go to another church.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.600]   I'm just gonna work and serve here.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.440]   So that's what I did.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.380]   I got a job, and I just served, right?
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.920]   Now, I don't say that to say, like, ha ha,
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.040]   like, you know, I did a great job, you know,
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.120]   like that kind of thing.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.120]   I say that because I started with great intentions,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.200]   but as you live your life, you guys all know,
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.760]   you might start off at the beginning of the course,
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.900]   like, I'm gonna study ahead.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.040]   I'm not gonna slack, and I'm not gonna cram.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.920]   Eighth week, it's like, oh my God!
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.120]   I gotta pull all-nighters.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   There's always a temptation to either slack
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.560]   or settle for less than best,
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.920]   and it happens even in ministry,
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.960]   where difficulty comes along, and here are the tests.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.880]   All of a sudden, you have a difficult member.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.960]   They're not committing to the membership covenant.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.960]   They're not committed to your vision.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.120]   You can deal with it and deal with all the ramifications.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.940]   They can hate you.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.780]   They can hate the church.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.620]   They can leave.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.480]   They can badmouth, all this stuff, or quick fix.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.720]   It's okay, just be a member.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.760]   It's fine, just come on in, and then keep the numbers.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.600]   Everything looks fine.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.920]   You know what that's like?
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.680]   That's like having mold and just painting right over it.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.300]   There's a temptation to do that, though.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.240]   There is.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.040]   Either because you're impatient,
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.840]   and you don't wanna deal with the long process
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.220]   of dealing with that, either because you're just lazy,
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.640]   either because there's too much invested for yourself,
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.240]   there's too much sacrifice to be made,
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.340]   it's too difficult, you just don't know how.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.000]   There's so many reasons to settle.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.480]   And I confess this, 'cause I see it sometimes.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.280]   I'm aware there is a temptation to settle
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.700]   for less than best, but it can't be done that way.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.680]   It can't.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.500]   I wanna give you an example.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   My wife and I, again, we like doing handiwork stuff.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.920]   The teachers and a bunch of people wanted to paint
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.600]   the elementary room over here.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.840]   Now, if you think about painting, it's an easy thing.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.180]   Here's a bucket of paint.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.480]   Here's the wall.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.080]   Doosh, like that's all you need to do, right?
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.000]   But if you've ever looked into what it requires
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.220]   to do a professional, legitimate job of painting,
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.940]   it's really, really difficult.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.200]   Here's a wall, right?
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.000]   You gotta make sure all the little holes are plugged.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.040]   So there's spackle, you have to sand that, too.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.920]   You gotta make sure if there's bad creases,
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.040]   you gotta make sure there's unevenness,
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.000]   you gotta sand that all out.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.360]   So that could actually take a full day,
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.760]   because you not only have to spackle the thing,
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.960]   you have to let it dry, you have to sand it,
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.100]   you have to make sure it's clean.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:15.940]   You wipe it down.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.400]   If there's any mold, you have to make sure it's whatever.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.200]   Chipping paint, worst.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.480]   If there's already paint on the wall, it chips,
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.320]   you're gone, right?
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.220]   Your work is in vain.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.640]   So that's why you have to chip that all off,
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.120]   sand it down.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.460]   Not only that, you know, if you're a noob,
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.160]   you just take the paint and just go up and down
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.340]   and up and down, you know?
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.240]   Mr. Miyagi said up and down.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.520]   That's not how you actually do it.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.360]   Why?
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.320]   Because you're gonna see streaks in your paint.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.720]   You're gonna have to make Vs that are moving laterally,
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.540]   okay?
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.880]   All this kind of stuff, if you're doing multiple coverages,
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   you know you actually have to do a light sand in between
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.960]   so that it adheres properly.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.800]   But if you wanna do all that, and the reason why I gave this
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.200]   is 'cause my wife is very meticulous.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.040]   She's looking at me right now,
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.720]   she's like, "What are you gonna say?"
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.400]   She's very meticulous, so she researched all that,
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.240]   you know?
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.000]   And she had this all mapped out, typical guy mentality.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.560]   Just get it done, all you have to do is just, you know?
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.120]   That temptation is there for the church.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.360]   And that's a warning to us.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.360]   The tension is there to be okay with sub-par,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.640]   the temptation is there to skip steps,
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.800]   the temptation is there to not push
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.560]   for what is absolutely spiritually best for the church.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.680]   And that is a big danger.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.740]   That is a big danger.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.480]   I wanna challenge you guys, you know?
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   Have you been carefully thinking about
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.840]   how am I affecting the culture of our church?
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.040]   How am I contributing to the building up,
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.520]   or perhaps the impeding of the build up of our church?
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.160]   How am I pushing for what is spiritually best?
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.000]   Have you thought that way?
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.800]   That my decision to blow off church,
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.160]   that my decision to make this second importance,
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.560]   or not as priority, how that is a spiritual decision
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.200]   when you think about the spiritual reality
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.640]   that we are one building.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.080]   And that's what Apostle Paul is trying
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.000]   to convince the church.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.200]   You're one building, you're God's building,
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.640]   and it's built up carefully upon the foundation of Christ.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.340]   Let's take care to build this church,
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.680]   never settling for what's less than best,
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.760]   spiritually best for the body of Christ.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.840]   That was point one.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:23.360]   That's a high calling, isn't it?
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.060]   That's a super high calling.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.840]   To always be thinking, how can we
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.920]   intentionally think to advance?
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   How can we do more?
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.920]   How can we do better?
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.480]   How can we honor Christ more?
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.720]   That kind of thinking is hard to do all the time, right?
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.040]   So how do you stay motivated?
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.720]   How do you stay driven to do that?
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.140]   Apostle Paul gives us the motivation in the next verses.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.580]   Let's take a look.
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.400]   Okay, going back to chapter three.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:52.160]   It says here, Apostle Paul says, verse 14.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.020]   I'm gonna read verse 14 and 15.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.880]   If any man's work which he has built on it remains,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.800]   he will receive a reward.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.820]   If many man's work is burnt up, he will suffer loss.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.500]   But he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.040]   He essentially says that there is an incentive.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.620]   That's really interesting.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.540]   For your participation, contribution, and service
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.300]   in building up the church, there is actually an incentive.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.940]   There is a reward to be given, okay?
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.360]   And it is promised.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.500]   Does that strike you as something strange?
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.040]   Just as earlier, it struck me strange
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.260]   that we would be judged for our work,
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.620]   likewise, it struck me strange
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.100]   that we would be rewarded for our work.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.300]   Why?
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.180]   Because, doesn't that mean I'm selfish?
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.140]   If I'm doing this because I think there's a kickback later,
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.480]   doesn't that just make me selfish?
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.660]   Doesn't that make me literally, in a bad sense,
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.860]   a tool, hired hand, in the negative sense of the word?
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.140]   Hmm, we have to think through that.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.660]   What does the Bible say?
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.940]   To me, it's just absolutely clear that the Bible teaches
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.300]   we will receive a reward for what we do in this life.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.500]   If you go over to 2 Corinthians chapter five,
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.900]   2 Corinthians chapter five.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.560]   (pages turning)
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:10.820]   Apostle Paul, starting from, I'm gonna read from verse nine.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:15.300]   Okay.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:20.980]   Okay, so 2 Corinthians chapter five, verse nine.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.900]   These are some really important verses.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.860]   He says, "Therefore, we also have as our ambition,
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.440]   "whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to him."
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.140]   Now, what he's saying is, I have this pure ambition.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.220]   Ambition is just that, ambition.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.940]   He has a drive, he has a desire, he has a want in his heart.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.140]   And his want is, I'm gonna please God.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.260]   Sometimes, for a lot of people, that's gonna sound strange.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.700]   It's like, whoa, I thought we couldn't do anything
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.020]   to please God more.
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.440]   I don't think that's well biblically termed.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.100]   In our practical living, as a child of God,
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.700]   we can please the Lord.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.400]   Just like we can also frustrate the Spirit.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.300]   We can grieve the Spirit.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.880]   When Christians start acting carnally,
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.180]   the Lord is not the same way, always pleased with that.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:14.100]   So here he says, "I have this ambition to please the Lord."
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.820]   Now, check this next verse out.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.440]   It says, "For," and you could almost translate that,
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.500]   "Because."
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.800]   "Because we must all appear before the judgment seat
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.100]   "of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.260]   "for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done,
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.980]   "whether good or bad."
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.740]   He's talking about Christians.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.140]   He's talking about meeting the Lord.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.400]   Is this the ultimate judgment,
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.420]   where you go to heaven and hell?
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.860]   No, it is not.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.500]   This is what theologically we would call
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.400]   the Bema Seat of Christ.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.620]   The Bema Seat of Christ, B-E-M-A, okay?
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.980]   Now, that term in itself is not necessarily
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.660]   like the craziest example, but it's essentially
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.440]   a platform for Christ to judge,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.700]   not in the punitive way, with wrath,
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.000]   but judged in the testing and examining way
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.340]   to reward the Christian.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.420]   So, Apostle Paul says, "I have this desire
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.840]   "to seek the reward, and that is actually
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.380]   "my main motivation."
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.660]   Think about that for a second.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.740]   Apostle Paul's motivation is the reward
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.700]   that is with Christ.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.220]   Is that something that we've done?
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.900]   I think because we were confused, I was confused.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.660]   I would feel selfish.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.180]   I would feel guilty of something wrong
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.260]   if I said, "I'm seeking a reward,
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.780]   "so that's why I do this," you know?
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.100]   Isn't it more godly to be like,
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.880]   "I'm doing this because I already received my reward."
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.260]   Yes, that's true, too, but this is also biblical.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.300]   Does that make sense?
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.420]   We function both.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.300]   We have already received, we have yet to receive,
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.140]   and that all motivates me.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.900]   Apostle Paul makes it very clear, though.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.100]   He is seeking the reward of his Savior.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.020]   That all makes sense, because to tell you honestly,
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.980]   it's something entirely different to seek
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.460]   the reward of your Savior, which is right,
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.060]   than to seek the reward of your brothers and saints.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.820]   To seek the reward of your master in heaven
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.980]   as opposed to your friends and your buddies,
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.080]   that's two different things.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.700]   In one arena, it is completely appropriate.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.740]   Not only appropriate, it's good.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.300]   For a man to seek kickback reward,
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.460]   whatever benefit from a random woman,
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.880]   that's just creepy.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.060]   If a man, a husband, receives the rewards,
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.540]   the benefits of his wife,
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.100]   that is in the parameters of what is God-ordained.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.460]   So the main question really is,
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:34.660]   it's not blanket statement wrong to seek a reward.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.820]   It's just, who are you seeking that reward from?
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:43.700]   Apostle Paul says, "I seek the reward of my Savior."
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.620]   Go to Revelations chapter 22.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.460]   It's a profound verse.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.860]   Revelation chapter two is the end of the Bible.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.060]   It's the last chapter in the Bible.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.100]   Jesus Christ is taught through this whole
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.420]   book of Revelations, you gotta be sober,
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.540]   you gotta be alert, you gotta make sure you're a pence,
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.020]   you gotta be ready, right?
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.040]   Ready for the coming of Christ.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.460]   But what's really interesting, that is in verse 12,
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.740]   in verse 12 of the book of Revelations, he says this,
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.900]   "Behold, I am coming quickly."
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.580]   So you might think he's gonna say,
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.900]   "So you better shape up."
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:16.740]   But you know what he says?
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.020]   He says, "And my reward is with me,
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.180]   "to render to every man according to what he has done."
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.580]   Christ is gonna come with rewards.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.580]   And that is a center for the Christian.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.060]   You guys, you know what the beautiful message
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.100]   of the cross is?
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.820]   It's true, the wrath of God and the judgment of God
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.060]   in its punitive sense is done, complete, finished,
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.940]   and there's nothing left for the Christian
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.780]   to receive in terms of wrath.
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.940]   That's just amazing.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.200]   You know what that means?
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.380]   We can only go up.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.300]   Apostle Paul feels no sense of this danger
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.220]   of receiving the wrathful hand of God.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.380]   No, what he anticipates now is the reward
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.300]   for his faithfulness.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.460]   He wants to please his master.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.760]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.420]   For the Christian, we're not sitting here
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.540]   looking for judgment, thinking,
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.460]   "Which way am I gonna go, heaven or hell?"
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.460]   We can only go up.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.980]   Who can promise you something like that?
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.540]   Who can say that to you?
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.860]   Your boss is never gonna tell you,
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.300]   "Oh, you can only go up from here."
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.960]   No, you can get fired, all right?
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.520]   Not your professor, not your boss,
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.480]   nobody in life can promise that but God.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.680]   And so God says, "There is an incentive.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.520]   "I have reward for you.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.960]   "In your labor, seek this,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.040]   "and build carefully the church of the Lord."
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.760]   So, in practical application, you do realize
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.000]   Apostle Paul, in this type of motivation,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.080]   it all makes sense.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.500]   If he fights, he fights to win.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.040]   If he runs, he runs to win.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.040]   And so, he's not just a guy who's
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.760]   trying to win the world, he's a guy
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.400]   who's trying to win the world.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.440]   He's a guy who's trying to win the world.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.480]   He's a guy who's trying to win the world.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.440]   He's a guy who's trying to win the world.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.440]   He's a guy who's trying to win the world.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.440]   He's a guy who's trying to win the world.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.440]   He's a guy who's trying to win the world.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.440]   He's a guy who's trying to win the world.
