[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Good morning, church family and friends.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.840]   My name is Katerina and I have the privilege of sharing my testimony with you all today.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.400]   I grew up in a Christian home with parents who taught me about God, brought me to church
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.880]   and enrolled me in Christian school.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.280]   I was often described as a good kid as I followed the rules and I stayed out of trouble.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.960]   But good appearances are not enough to save me.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.400]   God is all-knowing and he saw the depth of my sin.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.040]   God is also holy and so my sins against him were not just minor indiscretions but cosmic
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680]   treason.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.320]   I deserve judgment but God was rich in mercy and he loved me greatly.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.880]   He sent his only son to be condemned in my place.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.040]   Some of you may know that my husband and I are adopting a little boy from Korea.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.840]   I can't even begin to fathom the amount of love it must have taken for God to give up
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.720]   his only son.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.480]   This profound display of love and gospel truth changed my life at the young age of five.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.280]   I still vividly remember finding a small space in our home on our playground and praying
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   quietly that the Lord would forgive me of my sin and that he would use my life for his
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.400]   purpose.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   In that moment I was justified but I'm still being sanctified.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.520]   In particular I struggled a lot with control.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.160]   Those who know me know that I like things very neat and very tidy.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.840]   I believe that if I worked hard at something that it should yield the results that I expected.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.120]   This was often manifested in my relationship with other people.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.560]   I worked hard for other people's affirmation but disappointments would often cause me deep
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.040]   despair and anger.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.760]   In hindsight I see how God withheld certain friendships from me because he knew that they
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.180]   would become idols in my heart.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.380]   It is in vain that I struggle to control my life.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.880]   My hope cannot be placed on things that change because otherwise my hope and my joy will
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.240]   also fluctuate.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.840]   Rather the safest thing for me to do is to trust and surrender in the Lord, one who is
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   unchanging and in control of all things, because then I can be content in every circumstance.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.400]   At the age of 16 I chose to undergo sprinkling as a profession of my faith in Jesus.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.120]   At the church that I grew up in this was the method of baptism and I believed at that time
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.920]   that it was sufficient as an act of obedience.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.000]   This past year God has led me to meditate on Romans chapter 6, specifically verses 3
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.280]   to 5, which states, "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.440]   Jesus were baptized into his death?
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.960]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.680]   raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.160]   For if we have been united with him in death like this, we shall certainly be united with
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.840]   him in resurrection like this."
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.160]   Through this passage God led me to realize that baptism is meant to display his death
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.240]   and resurrection.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.360]   Just as he died, was buried, and was raised, my baptism shows how I die to myself and my
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.720]   plans.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.280]   I am buried and then raised to live a new life with him.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.800]   My decision to be baptized through immersion is an act of obedience to the convictions
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.960]   that God has placed in my heart through his word.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.760]   I am a child of God and my aim in this life is reflected through the words of Apostle
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.960]   Paul in Galatians 2.20, which states, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.720]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.800]   In the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.880]   gave himself for me."
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.000]   May he receive all glory and praise.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.240]   Thank you.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   [Applause]
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:35.240]   [Pause]
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   Thank you for sharing your testimony with us.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.240]   Katerina, do you understand that by going into the water you still die, yet your union
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.240]   with Christ's death by coming out of the water symbolizes your union with Christ in
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   the first place.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.240]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   [Applause]
