[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   All right.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   We're going to get started with our praise and prayer
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   for the month of July.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.760]   And before we begin, and as people are still coming in,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.760]   I want us to just kind of reflect on this question.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.760]   What are we doing here tonight?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.760]   Is it like a prerequisite hour and a half
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.760]   that you have to give to the Lord before you guys can go
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   across the way and play games?
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   Because I know there is time for fellowship this evening.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   Or are you here because you have had a rough week,
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   things have happened, and you want to draw near to the Lord?
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   Or are you here just because this is something
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   we do with our church?
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.760]   And what I want us to do before we actually
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.760]   get into our time of just praise and prayer
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.760]   is to reflect on that question.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.760]   What am I doing here?
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   Who am I praying to?
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.760]   Who am I approaching?
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   And so I want to give you about 30 seconds just
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   to ask God to prepare your heart.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   And then I'll pray for us, and then we'll
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760]   get everything started.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.760]   [PRAYER]
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   [PRAYER]
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   [PRAYER]
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:33.320]   Father, we are here seeking to draw near and to meet you.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:41.760]   We want to give you worship and sing praise to your name
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.600]   for you are worthy.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:51.280]   And help the truths that we sing and the prayers that we pray
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.960]   be sincere and help us to mean the words that we lift up.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.880]   Father, if our hearts have been far from you,
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.840]   I pray that you would draw near to us
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:13.080]   and rekindle the flame that is in our hearts.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.200]   Lord, if we're here with great needs,
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.640]   I pray that your nearness would be evident
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.400]   so that we would be reminded that you
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.720]   are a good, good father that draws near to his people
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.080]   and is eager to hear and answer.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.960]   Lord, we are here to worship.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.840]   We're here to pray.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.960]   Lord, would you help us not to do it just out
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.520]   of duty or function or religiosity,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.840]   but help us really to engage tonight?
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.760]   And we ask these things in Jesus' name.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.320]   I'm going to read a psalm, Psalm 57, 7 through 11.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:00.360]   It says, "My heart is steadfast, O God.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.840]   My heart is steadfast.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.200]   I will sing.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   Yes, I will sing praises.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.960]   Awake, my glory.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.920]   Awake, harp and lyre.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.040]   I will awaken the dawn.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.480]   I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.240]   I will sing praises to you among the nations.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.280]   For your lovingkindness is great to the heavens
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.080]   and your truth to the clouds.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.240]   Be exalted above the heavens, O God.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.760]   Let your glory be above all the earth."
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.560]   And this is a psalm that's been turned
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.000]   into many different songs.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.320]   And just, it's a, the words likely
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.400]   are very familiar to you guys.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.960]   But the opening of this psalm actually
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.080]   tells us that it was written when David was in a cave.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.840]   And he's fleeing for his life from Saul.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.800]   And he believes wholeheartedly that God is sovereign
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.360]   and that God is good, no matter what the circumstances
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.960]   around him are telling him.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.360]   And here in Psalm 57, the context
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.600]   is that David's good God, his sovereign God,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   has ordained some very harrowing times for the king.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.280]   And regardless of the situation that he is in,
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.040]   David's committed to doing three things.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.400]   He's committed to singing praises.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.520]   He's committed to giving thanks.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.200]   He's committed to exalting the Lord God Almighty.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.920]   And you see that as you read through Psalm 57.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.540]   And we come to pray tonight.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.120]   And we come to give thanks tonight.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.960]   We come to sing praises.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.400]   And we come to exalt the Lord and worship.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.200]   And before we sing, I want to remind us
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.320]   that we're approaching a thrice holy God, creator
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.520]   of the universe, who is worthy to be praised.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.840]   But at the same time, we're approaching our Father.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.920]   And we come to the throne of grace with boldness, right?
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.200]   But I hope that tonight, as we hear the word of God,
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.880]   as we sing, as we pray, that we don't forget
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.440]   that we exist for him.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.880]   He does not exist to do our bidding.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.720]   We are here to be recharged.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.560]   And we are here to be reminded of our purpose.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.880]   And we are here to just give glory to the Lord,
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.560]   no matter what circumstances you're in,
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.760]   whether you've had a great week in the Lord
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.200]   or whether you've struggled.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.520]   We are here just to give God his due.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.840]   And I'm going to read a Jonathan Edwards quote for you.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.080]   It reads, "God's purpose for my life
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.880]   is that I have a passion for God's glory,
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.120]   and that I have a passion for my joy in that glory,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   and that these two are one passion."
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.960]   It's a little bit of a mouthful.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.200]   But I hope and pray that whatever
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.040]   delights the heart of God is what truly brings us to life.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.600]   Amen?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.080]   So I'm going to invite you guys to stand with me.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.240]   And we're going to start with a few songs of praise.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:32.920]   Heard thou, O Lord, God high above all the earth.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:46.320]   Thou art exalted far above all gods.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:59.760]   Heard thou, O Lord, God high above all the earth.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:14.200]   Thou art exalted far above all gods.

[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.120]   I exalt thee.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   I exalt thee, O Lord.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:18.600]   Heard thou, O Lord, God high above all the earth.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   Thou art exalted far above all.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   Heard thou, O Lord, God high above all the earth.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:58.080]   Thou art exalted far above all gods.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   We exalt thee.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.560]   We exalt thee.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.560]   We exalt thee.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:27.560]   We exalt thee, O Lord.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:34.040]   We exalt thee.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   We exalt thee.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   We exalt thee.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   Oh, we exalt thee.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:00.520]   We exalt thee.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:07.520]   We exalt thee.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:16.520]   We exalt thee, O Lord.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:28.000]   We exalt thee.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   We exalt thee.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   We exalt thee, O Lord.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   We exalt thee.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:56.480]   We exalt thee.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.480]   We exalt thee.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   We exalt thee.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.960]   Let all the earth rejoice.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.960]   All the earth rejoice.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   He wraps himself in love.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:31.440]   And on his rise to the high, trembles at his voice.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   Trembles at his voice.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   How great is our God.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.440]   Sing with me.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.440]   How great is our God.

[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.920]   Age to age he stands.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   And ties in his hands.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.880]   The Lion and the Lamb.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   How great is our God.

[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   Worthy of all praise.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   And my heart will sing.

[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:33.880]   How great Thou art.

[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   And sings my soul.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   My Savior God to Thee.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   How great Thou art.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.880]   How great Thou art.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   Amen.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.880]   Please remain standing.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   I will read Psalm 103.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.

[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.

[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   When the kindness of God our Savior
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   and his love for mankind
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   appeared, he saved us,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   not on the basis
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.880]   of deeds which we have done
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   in righteousness,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.880]   but according to his mercy
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   by the washing of regeneration
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.880]   and by the renewing,
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.880]   renewing by the Holy Spirit,
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   whom he poured out upon
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.880]   us richly through Jesus Christ
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   our Savior, so
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   that being justified by his grace
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.880]   we would be made heirs
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   according to the hope
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   of eternal life.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   There is nothing good in us outside of Christ
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   and our only hope in this life
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.880]   is the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen?
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   And we're going to be singing about
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   just the worthiness
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   of God and
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   of Jesus our Savior.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.880]   [music]
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   [music]
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   [music]
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   [music]
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.880]   Who, oh Lord, could say themselves,
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   Their own soul could break?
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   Our shame was deeper than the sea,
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   Your Grace is deeper still.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.380]   Who, oh Lord,

[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:36.380]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:40.380]   You came down to find us,
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.380]   Let us out of doubt,
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.380]   You alone belongs,
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.380]   The highest praise.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.380]   Who, oh Lord, could say themselves,
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.380]   Who, oh Lord,

[00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.380]   Their own soul could break?
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:09.380]   Our shame was deeper than the sea,
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:13.380]   Your Grace is deeper still.

[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:45.380]   Who, oh Lord,
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.380]   could say themselves,
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.380]   Their own soul could break?
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:34:00.380]   Our shame was deeper than the sea,

[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.380]   You came down to find us,

[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.380]   You alone belongs,
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.380]   The highest praise.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.380]   You alone can rescue,
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.380]   You alone can save,
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:38.380]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.380]   You came down to find us,
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.380]   Let us out of doubt,

[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.380]   The highest praise.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:57.380]   Lift up, arise, lift up, arise,
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.380]   Medicator of life.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.380]   Lift up, arise, lift up, arise,
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.380]   Medicator of life.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.380]   Lift up, arise, lift up, arise,
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.380]   Medicator of life.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.380]   Lift up, arise, lift up, arise,
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.380]   Medicator of life.

[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.380]   Medicator of life.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.380]   You alone can rescue,
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.380]   You alone can save,
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:40.380]   You alone can lift us from the grave.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.380]   You came down to find us,
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.380]   Let us out of doubt,
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.380]   You alone belongs,
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.380]   The highest praise.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.380]   You alone belongs,
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:58.380]   The highest praise.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.380]   You alone belongs,
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:05.380]   The highest praise.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:12.380]   Alright, I invite you guys all to take a seat.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:22.380]   We're going to go into our first,
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.380]   I guess, clump of time for you guys to pray.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.380]   The first thing we're going to pray for,
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.380]   a lot of it is just related to our worship,
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.380]   the role of this church,
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:39.380]   and just in terms of how we've been doing spiritually.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:43.380]   So, the first topic, the first item of prayer,
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.380]   I invite you to pray a prayer of confession,
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.380]   of your need for saving.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.380]   And you can take time to confess to the Lord
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.380]   just the things that have been distracting you,
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.380]   the things that have been hindering your worship.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.380]   And secondly, we're going to be praying a prayer of repentance
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.380]   in the areas of sin.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.380]   And then, if you can pray for the leaders of the church
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:09.380]   that we will not turn from the left or to the right from the word,
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.380]   but we'll preach it and teach it accurately.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.380]   And not only teach it,
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:18.380]   but also live it out with joy and passion.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.380]   And please pray for that.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:24.380]   And then, just pray that the Lord will raise up
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.380]   more biblically literate teachers and leaders in our church.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:33.380]   Our church keeps growing, and we need servants.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.380]   But more than that, we need people who are just faithful
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.380]   to the kingdom call, so pray for that.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.380]   And then, lastly, if you can pray for
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.380]   just the upcoming Titus Bible study.
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.380]   If you are in a home group,
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.380]   also take time to pray for your home group leader.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.380]   If you're going to be here on Wednesday,
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.380]   pray for your small group leader.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.380]   In the Sunday school, all the kids also do Titus.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:04.380]   And so, please pray that God would really teach our children
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.380]   from an early age how to handle His word,
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.380]   how to honor His word, how to study it.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.380]   And so, the Sunday school teachers do play a big role in this.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.380]   And so, I'm going to give you guys about 10 minutes
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.380]   just to lift these things up in prayer.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.380]   And just whatever is on your mind also,
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.380]   just to lift those up to the Lord.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.380]   And then, after about 10 minutes,
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.380]   we're going to just sing another song
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.380]   and reflect on just the goodness of our Lord.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.380]   Okay, so we'll give you 10 minutes,
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.380]   and I'll make some kind of a noise.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.380]   I'll tap the mic or something that Pastor Peter usually does.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.380]   So, 10 minutes.

[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.220]   for the next series of prayer requests.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:45.220]   The first one, in about two weeks' time, we're going to be up
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.220]   in Palm Springs at the summer retreat.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:52.220]   Pray for God to minister powerfully through Dr. John
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:58.240]   Street and that in the areas of just personal and just whatever
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.240]   reconciliation entails that we would grow in those areas.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   And so, pray for that.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.240]   And also, we're going to take some time to pray for just the
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:15.260]   people in our lives who are sick, recently lost loved ones.
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:20.260]   This is just for you guys to be mindful of and pray for.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:26.260]   Victor Wang's father just passed away about like 20 hours ago.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.260]   So, please pray for him.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:32.260]   And we do have a lot of different church people with
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.260]   family members who are ill.
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.280]   And so, let's pray for them as well.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   We do have a lot of people expecting and in the process of
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.280]   adoption as well.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:49.280]   So, please pray that God will help them to become spiritually
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   healthy parents, just spiritually vibrant parents and
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.280]   that we as a community would surround these parents and
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.300]   really just bless and pray over their children.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:06.300]   At the same time, we do have a lot of couples in our church
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.300]   who are waiting for babies and the Lord hasn't said yet or said
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.300]   yes quite yet.
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.300]   So, if you know of them, just pray for them.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:19.300]   That one, in his time that he would provide the gift of
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.300]   children and two, that while they wait, they would maximize
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.300]   their time in giving God glory in this season of life.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.300]   So, pray for them.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:32.300]   And also, just there are I'm sure people in your lives around
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:36.300]   you and even in our church who are spiritually drifting, who
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:41.300]   have been entangled, who are struggling and who personally
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.300]   have been in a relationship with God.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.300]   And there are people who pretty much are on their way to turning
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.300]   their back on the Lord.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.300]   So, just pray for those people.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   And that should keep you guys very engaged for the next 10
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.300]   minutes or so.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.300]   Just praying for all the different needs of our church
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:02.300]   and our people.
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:06.300]   So, we're going to take another 10 minutes just to lift up these
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.300]   prayer requests on the wall.

[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:22.860]   I'm going to read Ephesians chapter 6, verses 10 to 13,
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.860]   and verse 18 for you.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.860]   "Finally be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.860]   Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.860]   firm against the schemes of the devil.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.860]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.860]   but against the rulers, against the powers,
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.860]   against the world forces of this darkness,
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:54.860]   against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:59.860]   Therefore take up the full armor of God so that you will be able
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.860]   to resist in the evil day, and having done everything,
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:07.860]   to stand firm."
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.860]   And it goes on in verse 18, "With all prayer and petition,
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:17.860]   pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view,
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:21.860]   be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.860]   all the saints."
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.860]   So as you guys know, the theme for this year is "Watch and Pray."
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.860]   And if you guys are finding it difficult to pray,
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.860]   part of that is it may be very well connected to your
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.860]   watchfulness or your sobriety.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:39.860]   Because as we discover that we're not being watchful,
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.860]   we're not being sober, and we are filling our hearts and our
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.860]   minds with the things of this world,
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   it really is difficult to just pray with passion and with fervor.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.860]   And here, the reminder is that our struggle is not against flesh
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.860]   and blood, but against the principalities,
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.860]   the rulers, and the spiritual forces.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:05.860]   And we do need to come together to pray because this is -- we
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:10.860]   cannot build our church by human effort or by leaning on just the
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.860]   backs of several people.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:19.860]   This is a church that is only built up by the Spirit of the Lord.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.860]   And so my encouragement is to keep praying,
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:27.860]   and in the strength of His might.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.860]   And I'm going to read just one more passage for you,
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.860]   1 Timothy 1:15.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:37.860]   And this is for those of us who may be feeling discouraged.
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.860]   I'm having a hard time praying.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.860]   I'm having a hard time engaging.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.860]   And there are things that are going on in my life that haven't
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.860]   been fully dealt with, and I feel like I'm not worthy to be here.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:54.860]   But this is a passage just to encourage you.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:07:00.860]   It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:03.860]   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:06.860]   among whom I am foremost of all.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:11.860]   And as I mentioned before, there's absolutely nothing good
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.860]   in us outside of Christ.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.860]   And praise God that He saved us while we were still wretches.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.860]   And praise God that our salvation was not earned,
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.860]   but it's a free gift.
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.860]   And because the sinless Savior died,
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:29.860]   my sinful soul is counted free, for God the just is satisfied to
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.860]   look on Him in part of me.
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:36.860]   And before we go into our third time of prayer,
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:42.860]   I want us to sing this just to be reminded of our identity in Christ.

[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.860]   The first one is we do have a cafe night that's gonna be held

[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:43.860]   in their hearts.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.860]   So let's pray for fertile soil.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.860]   Let's pray for questions to be answered,
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:53.860]   and the performers and the musicians,
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.860]   it's--there is a lot of pressure,
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.860]   and I'm sure they're gonna be thinking,
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:01.860]   like, "I gotta perform well to not hinder the evening,"
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.860]   but let's pray for the performers,
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.860]   that they will be able to just worship
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:10.860]   and to just feel free there.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.860]   So let's pray for them and that God would use them
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.860]   just to really minister well tomorrow night.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:20.860]   We're also gonna be praying for our India pastors,
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:23.860]   and that God would fill them with overflowing joy,
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.860]   with boldness, and with a passion for preaching.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.860]   If you guys have been there, my encouragement is pray
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.860]   for those pastors that you know by name.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:38.860]   Pray that just the word will be preached accurately and clearly,
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:42.860]   and that people will come to know the Lord.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.860]   And so let's pray for strength to persevere,
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:47.860]   and pray for spiritual leaders to be raised up,
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.860]   and for the lost in the Indian villages
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.860]   to come to know Christ intimately.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.860]   So let's pray for them.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:56.860]   Pray for our church to be a healthy community
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:59.860]   that equips and sends out workers into the harvest fields
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.860]   that are both local and global.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.860]   We cannot go out being biblically illiterate
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.860]   because that's just ignorance on fire,
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.860]   and then that spreads ignorance on fire.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.860]   Let's pray that as we are growing in the Lord,
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:16.860]   as we are growing in skill to handling His word,
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:21.860]   that people will go out really to proclaim His word
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:24.860]   to our Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:29.860]   So let's pray that we are a missionary-raising church.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.860]   So let's pray for those things.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.860]   And I'll give you about 10 minutes.

[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:19.140]   All right, for this last chunk of time,
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.960]   we're gonna just pray for one another.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.500]   We're gonna break up into groups of three or four.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.840]   And I wanna read you this quote.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.940]   "The underlying purpose of God in the world
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.900]   is the glory of God."
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.540]   Charles Ryrie.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.340]   And as you are breaking up into groups of three and four,
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   and I know you probably have a bunch of things
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.220]   that you need prayer over.
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:44.220]   There are things that you hope that happens in your life,
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.560]   attitudes you want changed in different circumstances
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.300]   you need wisdom in.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:54.060]   But the thing that I would like us to share with one another
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:59.060]   is in what areas of my life do I need help in surrendering to
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:00.060]   and glorifying God?
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:01.840]   'Cause our struggle is not against flesh and blood.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.840]   It is not our effort that attains spiritual maturity.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.940]   It is strictly by the grace of God.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.420]   And so let's take some time to just share
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:16.180]   and just share this.
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:19.860]   Whatever, if you have time to squeeze in other prayer
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:23.060]   requests by all means, whatever's pressing by all means.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:26.960]   But really what I would want us to just pray over
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.740]   for one another is that question.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:31.260]   Where do I need help?
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:33.320]   And so let's pray for that.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.340]   And then after about 10 minutes, I'll have you all stand
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:39.380]   and we'll do our final closing praise.
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.800]   (soft music)
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:28:00.520]   so you can hear it both ears.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:20.520]   So don't push it in all the way.
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:42.680]   I think all the lessons I learned, a lot of that feedback in the business of the industry,
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:50.360]   and the retreat, all put together, it sacked me with a lot of energy.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:29:01.080]   I went to a summer retreat, because I'm the speaker for the kids, and I'm running it.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:08.280]   I need to have a little bit of fun.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.760]   [INAUDIBLE]

[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.240]   What do I need help with?
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.400]   What is there?
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:59.120]   We don't have enough time.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:06.060]   I was thinking, my brain's kind of all scattered,
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:08.280]   like scatterbrained recently, just thinking
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.800]   about a bunch of different things.
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:16.400]   And I've been waking up early, but my prayer and devotion
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.760]   times has been, I'll say distracted,
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:25.000]   but it hasn't been focused the way I want it to.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.680]   So it's been kind of like this hills and valleys of priorities
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.200]   that I'm thinking about.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:35.360]   And then there's so much flooding in of work
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.680]   and other responsibilities.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:43.840]   And then I was thinking, why is this?
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.720]   Why is that happening?
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.080]   I can't pinpoint it.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.240]   A thought that came into my mind was, well,
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.400]   I'm on that latter half of my life.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.000]   You know what I mean?
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.200]   I was thinking of--
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.000]   Midlife crisis?
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000]   Yeah, midlife crisis.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.640]   Is it a midlife crisis?
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.720]   What is it?
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.000]   I don't want to go buy a car.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.240]   I know I do.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:11.520]   But I just need help in just really living
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:16.480]   the rest of my life and the good, strengthening years
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:22.720]   that my body's still functioning well, and to do it well.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.440]   I know that's very generic, but that's
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.400]   what I've been thinking about.
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.280]   Is it this umbrella of--
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.800]   I don't want to say worry, but am I wasting my life,
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.600]   in a sense?
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.040]   Am I wasting my time?
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.440]   Could I be doing more?
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.320]   I feel great for that.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.920]   And my kids-- and part of that umbrella is my kids' salvation.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.720]   CJ's 13.
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:53.160]   I still can say he's probably not a Christian.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.520]   I accepted Christ when I was a sixth grader,
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.320]   but obviously I wasn't mature back then.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:03.000]   But at least for the most part, they're open and saying, no,
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.080]   we're not Christian.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.360]   I don't know if I believe God.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.640]   I can't see Him.
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.520]   Those are the kind of big statements I get.

[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:08.360]   All right, if I can have you just come back to your seats
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.160]   and turn around, face the front.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:14.320]   And we're going to close with just a final reading
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:14.920]   of his word.
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:24.080]   And this is a command in charge of our Lord.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.080]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:41.440]   All right, Philippians 4, 4 through 9 reads,
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.400]   "Rejoice in the Lord always.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.400]   Again, I will say, rejoice.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.360]   Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.040]   The Lord is near.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.600]   Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.560]   and supplication with thanksgiving,
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:06.160]   let your request be made known to God.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.080]   And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension,
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.200]   will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.680]   Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable,
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.920]   whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.080]   whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:31.880]   and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.680]   The things that you've learned and received and heard
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:38.880]   and seen in me, practice these things.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.560]   And the God of peace will be with you."
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:44.840]   It's a command, rejoice in the Lord always.
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.800]   Amen?
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:49.200]   And joy is not an emotion.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.560]   It's the condition and an attitude of the heart
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.320]   that understands that God, when he's in his rightful place,
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.600]   all is well.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:59.680]   And can I invite you guys all to stand?
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:09.520]   And this is a song that's actually kind of hard to end.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.120]   And so just I hope that as we sing this song with hearts
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:18.040]   of celebration, it might end kind of awkwardly.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.480]   And if that's the case, just shout hallelujah.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.320]   And then we'll go from there.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.280]   And then after we sing, Elder Joe
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.120]   is going to wrap up our time in prayer.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.240]   [MUSIC - "HOW WE SAVE AND HEAL"]
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:39.720]   When I think about the Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me,
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.680]   how he filled me with the Holy Ghost,

[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:56.160]   When I think about the Lord, how he picked me up,
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:03.640]   turned me around, and he set my feet on solid ground.

[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.080]   how he filled me with the Holy Ghost,
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.560]   how he healed me to the utmost.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:50.040]   When I think about the Lord, how he picked me up,
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:57.040]   turned me around, how he set my feet on solid ground.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:02.040]   Make sure you watch out.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:04.040]   Hallelujah.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:11.040]   Thank you, Jesus, Lord, you're worthy of all the glory,
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:17.520]   all the honor, all the praise.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.000]   Make sure you watch out.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000]   Hallelujah.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:29.000]   Thank you, Jesus, Lord, you're worthy of all the glory,
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:35.480]   all the honor, all the praise.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   Make sure you watch out.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.480]   Hallelujah.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:47.960]   Thank you, Jesus, Lord, you're worthy of all the glory,
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:52.440]   all the honor, all the praise.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:59.920]   Make sure you watch out.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.920]   Hallelujah.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:10.400]   Thank you, Jesus, Lord, you're worthy of all the glory,

[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:23.880]   Amen.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:24.880]   Let's close in prayer.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:31.880]   God, we thank you for the fellowship we have in Christ.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.280]   We thank you for bringing your church together to pray in one
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:39.320]   voice, to lift up our hearts together, and beseech you,
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:42.440]   Lord God, for many various things going on in our own
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:46.240]   lives, in our own church, and the world.
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:51.080]   Lord, help us to see with your eyes what you see.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.680]   Help us to see the lost around us.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:43:00.480]   Help us, Lord God, to have your heart and your compassion.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.000]   Give us zeal for you, Lord God.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.200]   Help us to watch our own lives, that we can be ready and
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.560]   willing to pray.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.680]   Lord, we need your strength.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:15.400]   We need your spirit.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.880]   So we ask, Lord God, that you continue to build this church,
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:22.840]   build up each and every believer in this room.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:27.720]   Help us to trust you fully, that our hearts may love you,
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:33.280]   Lord God, and honor you with our lips, with our lives, that
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.280]   we represent you to this world, and that you may ultimately be
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:42.240]   pleased with what we give and what we sacrifice.
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:43.120]   We love you, Lord God.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.280]   We ask that you continue, Lord God, to strengthen and
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:51.040]   establish your church by your ways and your power.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:54.480]   So we entrust our lives to you at this time to you.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.960]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.400]   Amen.
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.800]   Have a good evening.
