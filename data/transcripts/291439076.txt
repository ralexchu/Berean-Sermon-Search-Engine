[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   We're looking at today, we're jumping back into Romans chapter 15, verse 19 to 21.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.280]   For the sake of time, I'm not going to read it because Elder Joe read it already, but
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.800]   let me pray first and we'll jump in.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.920]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.880]   You truly are a God who is patient, that even at times, Lord God, when you discipline the
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.520]   church, we know that you do it to get our attention, that we may continue to live a
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.360]   life truly worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.000]   We pray that the word that you have invested your very breath, your very spirit, Lord God,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.100]   would go forth and not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.780]   As it is a hammer, as it is a fire, mold us and make us.
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.480]   If we've come into this room with hardened hearts, we pray that your word would soften
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480]   it.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.160]   Many of our ears, Lord God, have been blocked and we have become hard of hearing.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.360]   I pray that your spirit would open it, Lord God, mold us and guide us, that the hammer
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.640]   of your word would come and make us, Lord God, into the clay, into the pot that you
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640]   desire.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640]   So we offer this time to you, asking you to speak.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.000]   As you know, I spent the last two and a half to three weeks out in Asia, out in Japan and
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.120]   out in China, and it's always an encouragement to me when I go, even though it's physically
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.080]   tiring, it helps me to see a larger picture of why our church needs to be doing what we're
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.640]   doing, why we need to be healthy.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.640]   So everything that we're doing in church, it kind of puts it in proper perspective.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.480]   World missions, there's things going on in Japan, and Japan has the reputation of being
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.680]   a very hardened place where people are not receptive to the gospel, but going there and
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.560]   meeting people and spending time with the local Christians and some of the non-Christians,
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.680]   there is a stirring taking place in Japan, that the younger generation seems to be a
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800]   bit more open to the gospel.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.940]   They are looking outside of themselves and the Japanese culture and their economy and
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.040]   looking for answers.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.960]   So it seems like, at least from the surface, and the missionaries agree, that there is
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.880]   something stirring in Japan, and possibly that may be the opening to the gospel coming
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.360]   into that country.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.640]   The area that we went with Harry is another area where you can sense that there's a movement
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.760]   in that area, that there's heavy persecution that took place, there's one of the largest
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.380]   unregistered churches in that area that got shut down not too long ago, and as a result
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.200]   of that, there's a lot of Christians who are underground looking for places to go, and
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.640]   it just seems like a perfect place to set up base for Harry and Linda to continue to
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.600]   do ministry.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.320]   All of these things were great experiences, and I come back just encouraged to see new
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.520]   doors being opened up for our church to get engaged in, but the bigger picture of why
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.720]   we exist as a church and what we are supposed to do as Christians.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.960]   Every once in a while, Christian or non-Christian, we will stick our heads up from our work and
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.240]   from our families and the busyness of life, and we ask the question, "Why am I doing this?
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.040]   Why am I going to church?
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.320]   Why do I go to Bible study?
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320]   Why do I sacrifice?
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   What am I doing?
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.320]   What is my purpose?"
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.240]   Because every once in a while, we'll recognize that we've been running without really thinking,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.960]   and our life has a way of keeping us busy that every once in a while, whether something
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   triggers it, maybe a new stage in life, you just had kids, you just got married, got a
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.560]   new job, and as a result of that, you're thinking about, "What is the purpose?
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.640]   Where am I headed?"
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.840]   Or maybe something didn't turn out the way you wanted.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.420]   You've been really working hard for a promotion.
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.320]   Maybe you started a new company.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.240]   Whatever it may be, it's just not working out the way you wanted, and as a result of
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.760]   that, it's causing you to think, "What is the reason?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.760]   What's the purpose?
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   Where am I headed?"
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.040]   Sometimes even success.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.560]   You're doing a great job, and you got your promotion.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.840]   Your bills are paid.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   You live in a nice house and living very comfortably, and as a result of that, you're taking a step
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.160]   back and, "Is this it?
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.320]   Is this all there is to life, and I'm pretty successful, and the majority of the world
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.760]   would be happy where I am, but is this really it?"
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.800]   It's understandable that the world continues to ask this question because there is no good
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.040]   answer to that, and the world is trying to make sense of what they're doing, like waking
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.380]   up early in the morning, getting a job, coming home, eating dinner, and it's just a routine
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.520]   over and over again.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.960]   You do that for a few months, for years, maybe a decade, and your conclusion is vanity, vanity,
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   all is vanity.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.520]   There's nothing new under the sun, but it doesn't make sense for Christians to live
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.340]   day-to-day asking, "What is my purpose?
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.480]   What is my aim?
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.480]   What is my goal?
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480]   Where am I headed?"
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.880]   Because the Scripture has made that very clear.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.100]   It is not ambiguous for a Christian what our goal is, what our aim ought to be.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.400]   Sometimes we can lose track of what that aim is because we get entangled with things maybe
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.640]   that we shouldn't be entangled with or just we forget, but what we ought to be living
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.120]   for is absolutely crystal clear.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.000]   So if a Christian continues to ask and continues to seek, "What is my purpose?"
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.800]   either that person does not know what the Scripture says or he has not made up his mind
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.440]   to be a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.320]   To be a follower of Jesus Christ, the answer is pretty clear.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.080]   What is the distinction between a follower of Jesus Christ and somebody who does not
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   follow Jesus Christ?
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.040]   And the answer is you have to be following Jesus Christ.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.120]   That's the simple answer.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.160]   You can't say you're a follower of Jesus Christ and not go where He goes and not do what He
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   does.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.480]   To be a follower simply means that you follow Jesus Christ.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:07.600]   Our culture, our post-Christian culture has made it normal to confess without living,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.200]   to profess a set of doctrines without having it affect any other part of our lives other
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.480]   than our Sunday worship.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.840]   But yet they are not followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.200]   Apostle Paul at the conclusion of the letter in the text that we're looking at basically
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.640]   tells us that this is the reason why he wrote this letter.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.480]   He wrote this letter because he was about to visit Rome and the purpose of visiting
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.680]   Rome is that he may prepare to go to Spain.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.560]   Paul knew from the day that he met Christ until the day he died why he lived and why
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.880]   he was doing what he was doing and then he died doing the exact thing that God called
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   him to do.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:54.240]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9, 26 and 27, "I do not run in such a way as not without aim.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.800]   I box in such a way as not beating the air.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.360]   But I discipline my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others I
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.680]   may not be disqualified."
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:14.220]   If you are living a life that you experience the wildest success, it may be a business,
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.760]   it may be a company, it may be friendship, whatever it may be, that you're consumed with
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.440]   that and for whatever the reason you did a great job and you've succeeded in that and
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:31.640]   at the end of that as a Christian it ends with so what?
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.920]   So what?
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.040]   So you have some money.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.960]   So you're able to buy a big house.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.720]   So you're able to drive a nice car.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   But so what?
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.440]   See to the world if this world is it, that's all there is to live for, then you want to
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.320]   make the most of it but as Christians who profess that this life, this world is under
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.560]   the judgment of God and the book of Revelation is real, that Christ is going to come and
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.800]   redeem what was lost and that he is preparing us for eternity.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.280]   So all that we are doing here is for the purpose of preparing for what is to come.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.880]   That's what we profess, that's what the gospel is, and that's what the scripture teaches
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.020]   us.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.780]   To profess that on Sunday and to live the rest of our lives like the rest of the world
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.440]   to milk as much life from this world before we go to the next is inconsistent with the
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.180]   doctrines that we profess.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:31.140]   We make ourselves to be hypocrites, to love the world and profess the gospel at the same
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.220]   time.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.440]   And it is not unique to Berean Community Church.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.260]   It is not because of a certain personality is preaching.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.380]   It is inconsistent with the doctrines that we profess.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.740]   Every evangelical church believes that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.700]   God and because of that, judgment is coming.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.780]   The wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness and as a result of that,
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.560]   the book of Revelation is going to come.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.700]   This is not a guess, this is not a suggestion, this is not a foretelling and looking into
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.860]   the future and saying maybe this might happen.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.700]   It is ordained by God that the world is going to be under the judgment because of sin.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.100]   And as a result of that, he saves us to glorify him, to enjoy this life.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:24.580]   But while we're on this world, while we're living in this world, our whole life ought
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:31.100]   to be consumed with telling others about this message that you and I have come to know and
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.300]   believe.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.060]   Anything else is hypocrisy.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:43.940]   Anything else is hypocrisy because you can't profess to say that your loved ones, your
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:49.820]   co-workers, the strangers that you see in this world are going to come under condemnation
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.700]   and that there's a second death waiting for them until they are forgiven of their sins
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.380]   and to profess this, to sing this, to memorize this and then to live and try to milk as much
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:05.660]   life from this world, this condemned world, before we leave is inconsistent, is hypocritical
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.900]   and it is ultimately unbelief.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.500]   If you believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, our calling is not to milk life from this
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:21.100]   world but to input as much life as we can before we leave because life is not found
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.940]   in this world.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.740]   We believe that life is found in Christ.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.940]   So our goal in life is to bring as much life into this world, not to milk as much life
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:35.180]   out of this world because milking much life out of this world is what the world is doing.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.300]   What the church is called to do is before you leave to input as much life into it before
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   we leave.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.940]   And that's why Paul says, "I do not run aimlessly without purpose, without goal."
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.700]   If you're living a self-centered life, you will be constantly asking yourself, "What
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.700]   is my goal?
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.020]   What is my purpose?"
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.860]   Because it's about you.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.500]   If you have established Christ as Lord over your life, your aim and goal is already established.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500]   It is clear.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:09.140]   It is to exalt Christ and to make Him known so that all the rest of the world will come
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.140]   to know this Savior, this Jesus Christ.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.220]   That's what Paul means in the second part of verse 19 when he says, "In the power of
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.820]   the Spirit so that from Jerusalem and roundabout as far as Ilikrium, I have fully preached
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.780]   the gospel of Christ."
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.260]   Paul's ministry lasted around 10 to 12 years.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.740]   At least it's the ministry that is recorded in the book of Acts.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.820]   In those 12 years, he traveled on foot the distance about a thousand miles from Jerusalem
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.980]   to Ilikrium.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.420]   That's about maybe from the distance between here and maybe the border of Oregon maybe.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.420]   He did this on foot.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.140]   He didn't have the fastest car.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.420]   I know they had horses, but I don't think he rode around in the fastest horses.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.420]   He was a tent maker.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.900]   It wasn't like he was traveling around in business class or first class.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:03.220]   He was walking around and he made his trip about three separate times in the matter of
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.700]   10 to 12 years.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.500]   I can't imagine in 10 years.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.860]   Our church has been around 21 years just even walking up to San Francisco.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.700]   This guy did this three times around.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:19.220]   He truly, when he says, "I poured myself out, I have fully preached the gospel."
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:26.260]   Paul says in Romans 15, 20, 21, "I have fully preached the gospel in two ways."
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.820]   He was faithful in the breadth of preaching the gospel.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.100]   He was also faithful in the depth of preaching the gospel.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.580]   That's the outline for today's message.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.020]   He was faithful in the breadth of preaching the gospel, in the distance, in the area,
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.060]   in the time that he preached.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.260]   In Romans 15, 20, it says, "And thus I aspire to preach the gospel."
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:53.300]   The word aspired, in some of your translations it says, "I was ambitious to preach the gospel."
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.420]   Some of your translations says, "It was my aim or I strive to preach the gospel."
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:04.300]   The Greek word that's translated aspired is philo to meo mai.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.540]   You already recognize the first part of it, philo, the word love.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.220]   The second part of the word, to meo mai, means to honor.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:18.100]   Apostle Paul loved the honor of preaching the gospel.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.260]   It was an honor for him.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.260]   He recognized it.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:26.300]   And for every Christian, it is not simply a burden, just like prayer.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.340]   Prayer has become a burden to the church to check off our spiritual discipline box.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.420]   But when you understand it in proper perspective, prayer is the ability to communicate with
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.740]   our creator, which we could not do because of our sins.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.980]   So the greatest privilege that you and I have as a Christian is to be able to pray and to
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.400]   be able to preach the gospel.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.260]   The reason why you're in a position to preach the gospel instead of hearing the gospel is
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.340]   because God has already been gracious to you.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:02.020]   And we have been given the honor and the privilege to be able to share with the world that there
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:08.020]   is an answer to all their problems, their sins, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.900]   And so that's what Paul means when he says, "I aspired, I loved the honor to be able to
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.300]   preach the gospel."
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.860]   He fully preached the gospel in breath, not where Christ was already named so that I would
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.860]   not build on another man's foundation.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:29.000]   But as it is written, "They who had no news of him shall see, and they who have not heard
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.740]   shall understand."
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:38.620]   Paul preached the gospel and his aim, his honor was to take it to places that was hard
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.580]   to reach.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.580]   Even in the way that we practice Christianity, even in the way we practice Christianity,
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.660]   we want to make sure if all our needs are taken care of.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.420]   We want to make sure that our children are taken care of.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.340]   We want to make sure that our bills are going to be paid.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.580]   We want to make sure that we're going to be safe.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.540]   We want to be made sure that we're not going to be persecuted.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.660]   We want to make sure that the room is going to be air conditioned.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.060]   We want to make sure that there's other people who are my age, that people we can fellowship
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.060]   with.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:15.780]   And when all of that has been taken care of, then I will pick up my cross and preach the
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.780]   gospel.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:22.940]   Apostle Paul says, "No, it is his ambition, it is his honor to take it to hard places.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.840]   It is his honor and it is his love to take it to places where people have not already
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.180]   heard."
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.500]   The reason why it is so hard in our generation to get the gospel to the remote part of the
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:41.780]   world, even after 2,000 years, because we don't want to be the first.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:47.820]   Paul says later on in Romans chapter 15, 22, "For this reason, I have often been prevented
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:53.780]   from coming to you, but now with no further place for me in these regions, and since I
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.820]   have had for many years a longing to come to you."
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:02.420]   Paul says the reason why he was prevented wasn't because he lacked transportation, wasn't
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.420]   because it was unsafe.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.300]   He said, "The reason why I couldn't come is because somebody already came and you don't
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.140]   need me to come."
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.500]   According to church tradition, Apostle Peter was the one who first came to Rome and he
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.860]   preached the gospel there.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:20.220]   He said he was preaching everywhere else he could possibly preach.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.820]   So now that I've kind of run out, it doesn't mean that he preached to every single individual
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.980]   between Jerusalem and Lycraeum.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.040]   He's saying that he made it his ambition to get the gospel to remotest places where no
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.060]   one has heard the gospel.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.460]   As far as I know, I've targeted all these places and I've already been there.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.220]   Some of these places he was stoned.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.080]   Some of these places he was whipped.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.600]   Some of these places he was chased out.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.340]   Some of these places he was put into prison.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:51.600]   But it's as far as I know, I made it my ambition to get the gospel out and now I'm about to
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.500]   come to you so to prepare to go even further out, all the way out to Spain.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.020]   And until then I couldn't come to you because my work was not finished.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.420]   He was a man who was committed to the gospel.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.460]   In our generation, we look at what Paul says and he said, "Well, he's an apostle.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.860]   He's a special man.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.460]   God had anointed him."
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:19.540]   He doesn't possibly expect an average Christian to live like Apostle Paul.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.940]   Does he?
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:27.180]   Whenever we hear challenging messages, we say, "Well, he didn't call everybody.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.060]   Where do we draw the line?
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.460]   Does he want us to go?"
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.900]   He doesn't clearly want all of us to go and I have a simple answer for that.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.620]   Yes, he does.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.540]   Yes, he does.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:48.060]   He didn't separate a few Christians and gave him the responsibility of preaching the gospel
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.140]   and then the rest of you take care of your family and clean the church every once in
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.660]   a while.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.780]   Get together in home groups and enjoy each other's company and then they're going to
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.500]   pluck some of you out of here and to go preach the gospel.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:07.820]   The rest of you just take care of your family and just be a good Christian.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.740]   He called all of us to go.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.140]   He didn't call all of us to go to China.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.620]   He didn't call all of us to go to Japan.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.660]   He didn't call all of us to go to the remote part of the world, but he told all of us to
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:27.740]   go, which means that if you don't go there, you need to go here.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:35.620]   And we need to live the life that we live here, sacrificing as much, giving as much,
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.700]   needed as much as the Tongs and the Hans and the different people that we know packed up
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.620]   their bags and gave up everything to go to preach the gospel.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:52.420]   That that's the calling of every Christian, not just for missionaries, not for some people,
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.060]   not just to do it every once in a while.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.460]   And this is not unique to Beroean community church.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.860]   You can't go into the scripture and read it and allow and meditate on it and study it
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:11.740]   and memorize it without every page in the Bible screaming out to you, "Missions!"
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:17.180]   Because every part of scripture from Genesis to Revelation is a holy God pursuing sinners
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.540]   and calling the sinners who have been called to go to get more sinners into the kingdom.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:27.760]   The whole scripture from Genesis to Revelation is about God's mission to the lost.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.740]   So when he told his disciples to come and follow me, which is also me and you, is to
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.540]   follow his mission.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.380]   So a Christian who is not given his whole life for the purpose of preaching the gospel
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:49.660]   has either neglected his walk with God or has never surrendered his life to Christ.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.260]   You checked off a box and say, "You know what?
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.340]   Do you believe that Jesus loves you and died for you and that if you believe in him, you'll
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.780]   forgive your sins, you're going to go to heaven?
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.780]   Do you believe that?"
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.700]   And you checked off that box.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.980]   But you've never surrendered your life to Christ.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.020]   When Jesus said that if you find your life, you will lose it, if you lose your life for
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.140]   my sake, you will truly find it.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.460]   And because you've never surrendered your life to Christ, you neither know the life
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.560]   in Christ either.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.820]   You see it in other people, you hear it in testimonies, but you don't know it.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.260]   Not by personal testimony.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.660]   You can regurgitate what somebody else said.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.480]   You can quote little quotes out of books.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.220]   You can go to conferences and hear good sermons and then say how encouraging it was, but it's
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:38.800]   never your personal testimony because you've never surrendered your life to Christ.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.540]   And as a result of that, you don't know the joy, you don't know the worship, you don't
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.680]   know the life in Christ either.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.760]   This is not unique to Berean Community Church.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.740]   Every part of scripture screams out the missions.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:21:00.920]   And that's why Paul says, "I do not run in such a way as not without aim, without purpose."
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.960]   So what if your children are healthy?
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.200]   They don't know Christ.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.440]   So what if your business becomes successful?
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.120]   At the end of the day, you just have more money in the bank.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.800]   So what if you live in a big house?
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.360]   At the end of the day, all of that is rubbish.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.280]   The central message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is all have sinned and fall short of
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.600]   the glory of God.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.600]   And because of that, the wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.400]   And we believe that and embrace that.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.920]   Now we live the rest of our lives proclaiming that truth.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.020]   That's what Apostle Paul meant.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:47.060]   In Acts chapter 21, 11 through 14, he was about to go to Rome and Agabus comes and he
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.780]   shares the vision with Paul at the Church of Ephesus, telling him that if you go here,
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.540]   trouble is waiting.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.580]   And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, "This
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.820]   is what the Holy Spirit says.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.780]   In this way, the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.940]   into the hands of the Gentiles."
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.100]   When we had heard this, we, as well as the local residents, began begging him not to
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.980]   go up to Jerusalem because they really loved Paul.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.380]   He's already sacrificed enough.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.020]   He's been beaten, put in prison.
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.100]   He was in Lystra, stone, thinking that he was dead.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.500]   And then he just walks back in.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.520]   Paul, you know, I know all of that stuff happened.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.620]   Maybe you just didn't know better.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.260]   But now God is revealing this is going to happen if you go to Rome.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:38.420]   Paul responds in verse 13, answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart?
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.780]   For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.780]   Jesus."
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.700]   Paul already knew.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.580]   It wasn't because Paul didn't plan well.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:57.220]   It was because he wasn't savvy and he didn't know how to avoid these people.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.620]   He says, "No, I'm ready."
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.580]   In fact, Jesus said, even from the first day that he called, "I'm going to show this man
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.220]   how much he's going to suffer for my name's sake."
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.740]   In fact, Paul says in Philippians that he wants to fellowship in the suffering of Christ,
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:15.360]   that he may also know what it means to have fellowship with the resurrected Christ.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.300]   He embraced it for the purpose of the gospel.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.500]   And then look what he says in verse 14, "And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.580]   asking, 'The will of the Lord be done.'"
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:39.100]   The paradigm of this world, we say, "God has blessed us when our children are well-fed.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.240]   God has blessed us when our bills are paid.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.060]   God has blessed us when we live a long and peaceful life, when our retirement fund grows
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.700]   and we have a lot of money in the bank."
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.740]   That's what the world says.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:57.700]   They recognize that they were using the worldly paradigm to stop Paul from going to Rome.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.220]   When Paul rebukes them and saying, "Why are you doing this?
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.220]   I'm ready not only to be bound but to die," they realize that the will of the Lord be
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.300]   done.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:16.620]   We automatically think that the Lord's will is our safety, is our health, is our success,
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.540]   is that we make something of our lives.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.220]   The Lord's will is clear in the scripture.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:30.920]   The Lord's will is his glory because when he is glorified, we live.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.420]   When he is not glorified, we die.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:43.260]   And so whether we live or whether we die, Paul says, "I pray that I may glorify him."
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.900]   So Paul was committed to the fullness of the gospel being preached in everywhere.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:53.020]   Acts chapter 20, 21-24, "I solemnly testify to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.060]   God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.740]   And now behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:05.780]   happen to me there, except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.380]   that bonds and afflictions await me."
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.220]   Paul already knew.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.660]   God was already telling him personally, not just through Agabus.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.540]   Paul was revealing to him, "Hardships waiting for you," but verse 24, "but I do not consider
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:26.340]   my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:33.460]   which I receive from the Lord Jesus to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God."
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.300]   This is not a calling simply for the apostle.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.540]   This is not like, "Oh, thank God he didn't call me to do this."
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:47.220]   I want to be a Christian, but I want to be one of those Christians that kind of is cool,
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.220]   you know, and the world is going to look at me and say, "Man, if that's what it means
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.700]   to be a Christian, I want to be a Christian too.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.060]   I want to be that kind of a Christian.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.220]   I've got plenty of money in the bank and everybody loves me, who's charismatic.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.660]   They walk into a room and they just light up."
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.660]   It's like, "What?
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.820]   I want to be like him.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.820]   What is he?"
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.820]   "Well, I'm a Christian."
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.820]   "I want to be a Christian too.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.540]   I want to be that guy.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.060]   Thank God he didn't call me to do what Paul was doing.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.780]   Did he?"
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.660]   Read the scriptures.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:25.380]   Apostle Paul is simply expressing and magnifying the calling of every Christian.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:33.540]   And if, even if it wasn't, it would only make sense.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.060]   Even if there wasn't a clear calling in scripture, it would only make sense.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.460]   Everyone who professed to believe this, to live their lives, to telling other people
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:47.140]   about it, it would only make sense.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:53.460]   We've created a Christianity, it's just utter nonsense to the world.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.940]   To profess it in a room and then they stay quiet outside.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.140]   It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.740]   To Sunday after Sunday, gathering together, talking about the judgment of God and the
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.700]   grace of God and heaven that is coming, and then stay quiet and silent about all the other
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.740]   people who are not under this grace.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:21.020]   And to not to live the rest of our lives to make sure that as many people can hear this
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.660]   truth before we die.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:29.020]   And to have our primary concern to make sure that the Lakers make it into the playoff this
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.060]   year.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:36.500]   That our fantasy football team wins.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.100]   That we have enough money for lunch.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:47.200]   That we save up enough vacation time to take this trip that we've been saving up for.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:53.880]   Whatever brings you the greatest joy is probably what you're living for.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.940]   Whatever you're sitting down thinking about more than meditating the most is probably
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.580]   what you're living for.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.420]   But Apostle Paul says, "I have fully preached the gospel."
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.300]   And the whole reason why he's writing this letter now is because he's run out of places
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   to go.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.060]   Now he's about to go to Spain and he's writing them saying, "Hey, can you help me out?"
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.140]   Secondly, Paul was faithful in the depth of preaching the gospel.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.020]   Not only was he committed to where he was going, but even the message itself he didn't
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.020]   compromise.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.180]   Acts chapter 20, 20 to 21, "How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:30.700]   was profitable and teaching you publicly from house to house, solemnly testifying both to
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.060]   Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:39.700]   Again in Acts 20, 26, "Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:46.900]   blood of all men, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God."
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.460]   Sometimes we are more concerned about offending the world that has offended God than the God
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.420]   who has been offended.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.420]   And even the way that we preach the gospel, we're so concerned about how they will receive
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:04.140]   it not realizing that we were the one who offended God.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:09.620]   And it is offensive for Christians to represent and to be an ambassador of God, begging the
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.700]   world to give God a chance.
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.140]   There's nothing in the scripture, there's no other time where I see in the Bible where
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:21.860]   any prophet or an apostle or an evangelist stands before a crowd of sinners and says,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:27.180]   "Give Jesus a chance, please."
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.140]   God is the one who was offended.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.700]   God is the one that we blasphemed against.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.940]   And as a result of that, the world is under condemnation.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:44.420]   So the clear preaching of the gospel is a calling to sinners to repent and receive forgiveness
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.620]   of sins.
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:50.220]   That this God who had every right to crush us because of our sins has decided to show
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.620]   mercy for the time being.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.120]   For the time being, because we know the end is coming.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.880]   We know that at the end of Revelation it is finished.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.180]   But we live in a period of grace where God is giving sinners an opportunity to repent.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.660]   And during that period, our whole aim, our whole purpose, our whole ambition ought to
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.420]   be to bring people to Christ.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:22.380]   And any other endeavor, good or bad, is a distraction, maybe even sinful.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.660]   First Thessalonians 2, 3 to 4, "For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:31.780]   way of deceit, but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:38.180]   we speak not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts."
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.140]   Even in the way that we preach the gospel, we need to preach the whole counsel of God
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.480]   from the beginning to the end.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.820]   If men come to Christ, if women come to Christ not being convicted, not understanding the
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:59.420]   weightiness of their own sins, all we make God out to be is a Santa Claus, a grandfather
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.420]   who loves you unconditionally.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.940]   No matter what you do, there is nothing you can do for God to be angry with you and it
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   doesn't matter.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   And so when you created a God who is not holy, you created a God who accepts you no matter
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.940]   what you do.
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.700]   And so we make light of sin.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:24.060]   All we need to do is say, "God forgive," and then we just move on.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.340]   Why the scripture tells us to live holy lives and why the church needs to be healthy is
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.260]   because the church has been called to be the light.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:38.060]   If all we're going to do is enjoy life, the sooner we die, the better.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:44.660]   And excuse my language, the most beautiful place in the world that you want to visit
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:49.500]   sucks compared to where we're going to go.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.780]   Because even the most beautiful place in the world is tainted by sin.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:58.620]   Remember in the book of Genesis, when sin came in, so did the earth got defiled.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:04.940]   There's weeds, there's bugs, there's rats, you know, everywhere you go.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:12.500]   So even the most beautiful place in comparison to where we're going is rubbish.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.620]   But if all we're going to do in this life is to enjoy it, the sooner we leave it, the
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.260]   better.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.820]   So if somebody dies early, we should say, "Thank God they left.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.460]   They don't have to deal with this.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.140]   Now they're in a better place."
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.900]   So we should celebrate that because they're better off than we are if our only purpose
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:36.300]   in life is to enjoy it.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.340]   But our calling and our aim, our ambition is to make sure that other people come with
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.340]   us.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:48.540]   And the only reason why Jesus Christ did not come yet, even after 2,000 years, in Matthew
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.260]   24, he says, "When the gospel has reached the remotest part of the world, then he has
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.260]   come."
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.580]   It's been 2,000 years and it hasn't happened yet.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:02.340]   But when that happens, when the church wakes up and begins to preach the gospel to the
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.500]   remotest part of the world.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.300]   You know, you and I live in a generation where it is possible.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.540]   It hasn't happened where it is possible.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:15.460]   Because of technology, because of politics, because of money.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.940]   Some of you guys remember 30 years ago, you just didn't have a thought like, "Oh, I'm
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.740]   going to go to Europe," and hopped on a plane and just went.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.780]   It just didn't happen like that.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.540]   It costs too much money.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.020]   When you get there, you don't speak the language.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.980]   There's no app for you.
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.580]   Nobody over there waiting for you to speak English and show you around.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.900]   There's no tour guides over there.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.140]   30 years ago, if you wanted to go somewhere, you got in a car and you drove somewhere.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:43.100]   If you were like famous or you're like multi-billionaire or something, you were able to travel and
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.100]   do all this.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:48.140]   An average person just didn't get up and say, "Oh, I'm going to save my points and I'm going
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.140]   to go travel the world."
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.860]   That just didn't happen.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:59.820]   It's happening now because of technology, because of money, because of freedom.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:07.300]   And instead of using that to indulge ourselves, those are vehicles that God has given us to
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.060]   go.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:17.420]   We're able to reach the remotest part of the world through the internet.
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.500]   And the only reason why that hasn't happened is not because of opportunity, it's because
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.740]   of us.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:30.460]   Paul in his preaching did not adulterate the gospel, the whole counsel of God.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.740]   In 2 Corinthians 4, 2, "But we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:39.400]   in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth, commending
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.860]   ourselves to every man's conscience."
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.540]   And then verse 3, "And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing."
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:52.380]   In other words, Apostle Paul refused to compromise the gospel, every part of it.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:57.860]   2 Timothy 3, 16, "All scriptures inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof,"
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:02.460]   in some of your translations it says, "rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:07.340]   so that the man of God may be adequately equipped for every good work."
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.380]   People ask us, "Why are you studying Leviticus?
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.380]   It's so difficult."
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:15.660]   And studying Revelation, you call it, "Why are you doing that?
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.660]   It's so complicated."
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:22.380]   There's a simple answer to that, because it's there.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.380]   Because it's there.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.380]   It's in the Bible.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.100]   There's nothing that he put in there, "You know what?
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.780]   Study Romans and everything else will take care of itself."
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.780]   It's in there for a reason.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.780]   God's a sovereign God.
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.460]   You don't have a conversation with somebody for an hour and then you just zoned out for
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.980]   20 minutes, and then you come back and it's like, "Okay, now I understand everything."
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.420]   Those 20 minutes could be crucial.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:51.700]   You might be right in the middle of a DTR, and they confessed their love for you, and
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.940]   for 20 minutes you zoned out.
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.060]   You had ADD for 20 minutes, and they're waiting for your answer.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.580]   It's like, "Hey, see you later."
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:04.940]   Those 20 minutes, you don't know what's in those 20 minutes.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.140]   It may change your life.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.660]   You don't go and read like four chapters and then you skip the fifth chapter and you go
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.460]   to the sixth chapter and then ... Everything in the scripture is there for a reason.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:21.620]   That's why all scripture is God-breathed and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.180]   correction, for training in righteousness.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:32.940]   If the Word of God discourages you, it's there to discourage you.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:39.540]   If the correct understanding of the Word of God causes fear in you, it's there for a reason.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.440]   He meant for you to be fearful.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:47.060]   When it describes hell, when it describes judgment, when it describes warnings, you
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.060]   can't just block that.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.580]   "Oh, when we do that, people are fearful."
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.420]   They say, "God casts out fear, and they use another part of the scripture to nullify this
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.140]   part of the scripture, and so we kind of create this God that is going to be palatable to
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:02.500]   as many people as possible, and the next thing you know, it's not the gospel at all."
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:07.860]   The scripture says anything that you add, anything you take away, anathema.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.420]   It's exactly what it says in Galatians 1, 7 through 10, right?
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.420]   Paul says it twice.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:16.580]   Anybody come to you, preach another gospel, and all these Judaizers were doing, they were
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.780]   adding to the gospel.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.980]   They weren't rejecting Jesus' resurrection.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.540]   They weren't rejecting His blood sacrifice and atonement.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.300]   All they were saying was, "You can have that, but you need to be circumcised first, and
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.820]   you need to keep the Sabbath first."
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.260]   And Paul, "But if you do that, you are perverting the gospel.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.260]   Let you be anathema.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.340]   Go to hell," basically he says twice.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:45.500]   You can't add, and you can't take away from that.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.820]   If the Word of God is confusing, it is meant for you to slow down and take time to study.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.860]   Not for you to flip through and say, "Oh, it's confusing, so therefore God doesn't want
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.260]   me to know."
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.900]   If you're having a conversation with somebody, somebody says something confusing, you don't
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.140]   just sit there like, "I didn't understand.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.340]   Next."
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.980]   You're going to ask, "What did you mean by that?
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.980]   I don't get it."
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.180]   And you're going to take extra time to find out what they meant.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:15.580]   A lot of times, the things that you're confused by, there's a lot more meaning behind it than
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.100]   the things that are obvious.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:23.860]   That's why we study Leviticus, because all scripture is inspired by God and is profitable.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.660]   So in preaching the gospel, we have to make sure that we understand the whole counsel
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.340]   of God, all of it.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:38.300]   His wrath, His holiness, His judgment, because without understanding that, your understanding
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:44.060]   of God's grace and mercy and patience is going to be like a three-year-old.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.340]   He lets me do whatever I want.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.940]   I love Jesus.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.860]   That's about the extent of your understanding of grace when you don't understand the God
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.500]   of the Old Testament.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:01.620]   That's why Paul says he fulfilled the gospel, the breadth and the depth of the gospel.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.780]   But I want to conclude with this.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:06.220]   Paul was faithful even in the length in preaching the gospel.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.940]   Second Timothy 4, 6, and 7, "For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.500]   the time of my departure has come.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.620]   I have fought the good fight.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.620]   I have finished the course.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.540]   I have kept the faith."
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:20.340]   So many people start out their Christian life well, with a bang.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.900]   By the time their third, fourth, fifth year into their walk with God, they fizz it out
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.900]   already.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:31.500]   And I see so many guys, you know, they're 33 years old, 34 years old, and they're already
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.300]   acting like old men.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.460]   It's for the young kids.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.660]   Let the college students evangelize.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.660]   Let them go to missions.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.620]   I've done my part when I was their age.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.880]   They're 33.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.860]   But you already have a mindset of an old person just waiting to die.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:49.860]   Like I'm at the end.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.020]   There's more people older than you at 33 in this world than younger than you.
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:40:00.260]   But what is the danger of that is you have that mentality, that time of activity and
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:04.820]   passion and sacrifice, that's for young people.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.180]   I got too many responsibilities, you know.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.300]   And I understand why they do that because you watch a lot of sports and, you know, LeBron
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.540]   James is 33 years old, and everybody says how old he is.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.540]   And you're 33.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.540]   It's like, "Yeah, I am old."
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:27.660]   He's a professional basketball player that is competing at the peak.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:35.540]   He's got about 50 years left of life, an average, maybe 60.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:36.860]   And you know, I get it.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.460]   You know, you kind of watch these guys at 33 talking about, "Oh, how old I am."
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.700]   It's like, "Oh, I'm so old too."
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:47.400]   And then you start living like an old person, like all of your days of commitment and sacrifice
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.300]   and evangelizing and mission, it's behind me.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:41:00.540]   Apostle Paul started, committed to the Lord, even sitting in prison.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.540]   He was preaching the gospel.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:10.940]   And until the day he died, he left this world preaching the gospel.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.220]   That is our purpose.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.260]   You don't need another book to tell you what your purpose is.
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.700]   You don't need to go to a conference.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.600]   You don't need to have small group seminars.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:26.580]   You don't need to look for counselors because the Bible has made that very clear.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:34.460]   Go make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:39.420]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you and lo, I will be with you to the end
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.420]   of the age.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:48.940]   And any other activity that prevents us or distracts us from that activity is either
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:55.140]   not profitable or maybe even sinful.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.840]   And let me conclude with this.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.140]   I've been praying.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:03.580]   I've been praying that, you know, our church is growing and I'm very thankful that we were
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.660]   able to add new pastors to our church.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.700]   And as a result of that, we're able to do things that we weren't able to do.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.740]   So I've been praying, "Lord, where should I commit my time?"
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.380]   Now we feel like we're getting into a new stage of our church.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.420]   Where do you want me to commit my time?
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:24.700]   Coming back from this trip, it's become more clear to me, again, not that it's changing,
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:30.740]   not that this is anything new to the church, but just kind of reminded me why this church
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.700]   was planted to begin with.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.500]   We're here to be a light in this dark world.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:44.180]   Whether it is in Irvine, whether it is in India or Japan or in China or anywhere else
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.660]   that God calls us, the reason why we need to be healthy, why we need to be strong, why
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:54.780]   we need to be biblical, why we need to be Bereans is because He didn't call us home
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.260]   yet.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.340]   Where we're going to go is paradise.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.380]   Where we're headed is where there's no more tears, no more suffering, no more pain, no
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:14.060]   more illness, no more sickness, no more poverty, no more illnesses, no more broken homes, no
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:23.540]   more child abuse, no more sexual predators, no more pornography, no more pain.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.180]   That's where we're headed.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:35.700]   But until we get there, until we get there, we need to commit ourselves to get as many
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.300]   people to come with us as possible.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:44.540]   And anything else is a waste of life.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:50.420]   I pray that this next stage of our church life and your life, that we be able to use
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:57.940]   our common resources, our fellowship, our people, our finances for that purpose, that
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.940]   God may be glorified.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.940]   Let's pray.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:09.140]   Again, let's take some time to pray before the Lord.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:14.920]   And just asking for just one thing.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.540]   To be honest with your faith.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.980]   Is your faith consistent with your life?
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:29.340]   Are the songs that we sing just an acknowledgment of doctrine?
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.140]   Or is it a confession of our lives?
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.940]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
