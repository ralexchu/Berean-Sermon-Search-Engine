[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Good morning.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.640]   My name is Tiffany and it's a privilege to stand before all of you this morning and share
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.800]   the work God's done in my life.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.240]   The unfolding of my testimony isn't linear, but looking back, God was working in every
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.000]   season of my life.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.360]   And by God's grace, he radically transformed my heart, mind, and soul.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.680]   He took my heart of stone and gave me a new heart of flesh.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.960]   Total death reigned in my body and even when I believed, I was saved, but his relentless
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.560]   love was greater than any chains of sin that held me down.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.120]   I acknowledge that God's gift of grace through faith saved me and although it took time,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.640]   he allowed me to see my depravity leading me to repentance.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.160]   I am nothing without Christ and even when I was still a sinner, Christ died for me.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.760]   His love is more than I could ever comprehend.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.280]   Because of God's saving grace and redemptive work, I was made spiritually alive by grace
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.640]   through faith in Christ alone.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960]   Although I grew up in a practicing Buddhist family, my parents put me in a Lutheran school
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.720]   from preschool until fifth grade, which marked my very first exposure to God.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.760]   Growing up in a Buddhist household made it difficult to explore God to the extent that
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.240]   I desired, but by God's sovereign guidance, I was introduced to a handful of brothers
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.920]   and sisters in Christ later in my life who helped foster the character I exhibit today.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.480]   As a response to their financial struggle, my parents pulled me out of Red Hill Lutheran
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.920]   and I later found myself attending my local public school.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.240]   At this time, my character began to shift from a diligent and humble student to a boastful
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.200]   and attention-seeking delinquent.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.000]   During my rebellion stage, I would partake in illegal drugs and alcohol even during school
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.600]   hours and the lack of respect I had for my teachers and parents increased.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.880]   On top of that, I chose to spend time around the wrong crowds, shoplifted when I had the
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.720]   chance and dismissed the idea of purity.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.880]   However, there was a huge lack of remorse during this time and I found my life continuing
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.560]   to spiral downward in this path.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.520]   There was a thrill in engaging in these activities and I never considered the consequences or
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.600]   recognized that I was sitting against a holy God.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.400]   Looking back, the most absurd part is that it was all exhilarating to me and I never
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.840]   once felt an ounce of guilt.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.640]   Shortly after, I fell into a state of severe depression that took control of my life.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.080]   I felt an overwhelming weight of darkness that resulted from a lack of identity.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.800]   I didn't know who I was anymore and I didn't know how to respond.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.200]   I sought professional counsel only to end up with a literal pill of a band-aid solution.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.800]   Over time, I felt like I was drowning and often found myself contemplating life and
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.960]   whether or not it was worth living.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.680]   My appetite for apathy continued to grow and this led to multiple attempts of suicide as
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.000]   I had absolutely no desire to live.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.080]   During my freshman year in college, I continued to be negligent in the way I studied and the
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.000]   way I conducted myself.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.320]   Several events transpired not too long after that caused me to disregard pretty much everything.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.480]   Every day became a mindless passing that had no meaning and I no longer wanted to be a
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.680]   part of what life had to offer.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.440]   I was burdened by the guilt and shame that I felt during this time from being suspended
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.920]   from a prestigious university to feeling like a disappointment of a child and I filled this
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.040]   void with substances.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.200]   Amidst the darkest seasons of my life, I was invited by a friend to a church she had been
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   attending.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.080]   Attending that service felt like a breath of fresh air after drowning in sin for the
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.760]   better part of my life.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.440]   I remember bursting into tears after experiencing what it meant to find peace, have hope, and
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   be joyful.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.960]   Though I was introduced to this newfound hope, I felt myself clinging to the world and everything
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   in it.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.040]   I felt almost comfortable in the darkness I was in even though a small part of me knew
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   that Jesus was ultimately my savior.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.840]   Unfortunately, this wasn't a truth I had yet accepted and the way I lived outside of
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.940]   church was evident of that.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.080]   In May of 2019, I became a part of a church where I would find myself playing Christian.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.640]   I got involved in things like baptism and several church events only to find myself
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.000]   with temporary solutions to an otherwise eternal suffering.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.040]   While I was more disciplined to control my behaviors and act like a Christian, everything
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.840]   I did was for my own self-righteousness and inside was still a heart that thrived on sin.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.280]   I had terrible issues of personal integrity and I concealed deep anger and resentment
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   within me.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.840]   I identified as a Christian but I was an unrepentant sinner.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.760]   The pandemic was life-changing for me in more ways than one.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.680]   I felt this desire to dive deeper in the word of God and it was a time where I was reintroduced
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.460]   to the entirety of the gospel as opposed to the small out of context verses I would see
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.360]   in the churches I had been attending.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.920]   I was introspective in the way that I was living as a Christian and questioned my salvation.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.200]   I was reluctant during this time in believing in the God I had just rediscovered but I was
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.280]   patient and prayful nonetheless.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.520]   Several YouTube sermons and one American gospel stream later, God opened my eyes and allowed
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.780]   me to recognize that my transformation was not something I had any part in.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.960]   It was foolish and prideful of me to believe that I, a wretched and broken sinner, chose
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.360]   Jesus when in reality it was entirely the work of the Spirit and His loving kindness
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.560]   and amazing grace that gave me the gift of repentance.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.680]   And I am thankful that it wasn't up to me.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.520]   My life would have been completely different and I wouldn't be here before all of you
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.880]   if it was.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.640]   I am grateful that in Ezekiel 36, 26, God gives us a new heart of flesh where we can
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.360]   say no to sin and yes to His grace and mercies.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.040]   Not only did He choose me, it was also Him who regenerated me, blessed me with faith,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.400]   justified me, sanctified me, and on top of that, adopted me as His own and promised to
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   keep me forever.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.960]   I know that sanctification is a lifelong process and words will never express how grateful
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.560]   I am for the work the Lord has done in me.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.680]   By God's grace, He radically transformed the desires of my heart and brought me from
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.640]   death to life, from sin to righteousness, from broken to made new.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.600]   I have hope that there is an eternal peace far greater than the fleeting pleasures that
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.960]   life offers, freedom from sin that I was bound by during the years leading up to this moment,
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.000]   and gratefulness for our Heavenly Father so beyond gracious that He would choose me as
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.120]   His own when I could not find a single redeemable quality within myself.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   In Galatians 2, 20, I am reminded that I am crucified with Christ.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.520]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.200]   In the life which I now live, in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.680]   who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.480]   My identity is in Christ alone and my soul rests and greatly rejoices in that truth.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.520]   His truth is the cornerstone of my life and despite the trials and tribulations in my
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.680]   life, my hope is secured in Christ who is the author and finisher of my faith.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   [applause]
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   [laughter]
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   [applause]
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.640]   You
