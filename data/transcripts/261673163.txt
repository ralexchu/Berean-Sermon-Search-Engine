[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   If you could turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 12, I'll be reading from verse 9 all
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.800]   the way to verse 14.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.240]   Let love be genuine.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.840]   Abhor what is evil.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.760]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.800]   Love one another with brotherly affection.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.160]   Outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.520]   Do not be slothful in zeal.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.840]   Be fervent in spirit.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840]   Serve the Lord.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.880]   Rejoice in hope.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.560]   Be patient in tribulation.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.640]   Be constant in prayer.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.040]   Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.840]   Bless those who persecute you and bless and do not curse them.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.360]   Let's pray.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.160]   Heavenly Father, we want to praise you and thank you.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.960]   You are worthy of all that we have.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.280]   You are worthy of our praise, our affection, our very lives, Lord God, as you've purchased
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.520]   us for the purpose of declaring your glory.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.840]   We pray that your word would help and guide us, Lord God, to shape our thoughts, our mind,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.720]   our will, our life.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.160]   May it be sanctified, Lord God, because we are confronted by it.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.000]   I pray that the preaching of your word would be a proclamation of the voice of Christ,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.800]   and your children will hear his voice and follow him.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.400]   So we ask for your anointing over this time.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   Amen.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.280]   All right, so as you guys know, Romans chapter 12, we started a new section in the book of
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.520]   Romans where he's talking about the ramification of believing in justification.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.920]   How should justification look like in the life of a Christian?
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.060]   Again, I know it is a broken record, but for whatever the reason, there has been a heavy
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.960]   emphasis on justification, especially in the last maybe about 10 years, and we've benefited
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.800]   from it.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.720]   And I think it's crucial, it's fundamental for every Christian to have a deep understanding
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.240]   of justification.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.920]   But along with the emphasis on justification, there's also been a confusion as to what does
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.660]   it mean to be justified.
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.100]   And so there are some discussions going on, again, in some circles where they think justification
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.120]   should be the only thing that we talked about in the church.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.060]   Sanctification somehow leads to legalism and burden, where again, it is a false dichotomy
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.220]   when we understand that somehow sanctification and justification are two separate things,
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.520]   and as long as we are justified, sanctification may happen or may not happen, it doesn't matter
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.140]   as long as we're justified, which is absolutely wrong.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.400]   And this is nothing new in the church today.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.040]   All throughout church history in the 2000 years, there's always been a fringe movement
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.440]   to nullify sanctification, because it's easier.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.820]   It's easier to bring people to church, it's easier for people to keep the people in church,
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.860]   it's easier to live a life where you're living in the world and at the church same time when
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.600]   you get rid of sanctification, because if you get rid of sanctification or de-emphasize
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.220]   sanctification, basically you have a group of people who are at church who are embracing
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.900]   Christ for his love, and you take away all the struggle of what it means to be a follower
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.780]   I mean, you can humanly understand why that would be attractive to any generation.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.060]   You focus on the love of Christ and his free gift and eternal salvation, and then all the
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.940]   struggles, all the wrestling, all the difficult things of being a Christian, you just wipe
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.940]   that clean.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.940]   And you can, again, you can easily see why that type of teaching would be attractive
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.700]   to so many people.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.380]   Let me say right off the bat, Christianity is a very unnatural religion.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.100]   It's very unnatural.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.180]   Christianity is not something that you can practice in your flesh, because it goes against
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.580]   the very nature of the core values that we are taught in this world.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.480]   To say that the greatest in the kingdom of God is the one who serves and not the one
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.220]   being served, think about the fundamental teaching behind what that says.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.340]   Our whole life, we study hard, we get good grades, we work hard to get ahead so that
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.140]   we can have a better life and make something of ourselves.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.540]   When Jesus says, before he goes to the cross, if you want to be great in the kingdom of
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.740]   God, you need to learn to be the servant of all, it goes directly against.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.020]   It's not just a little bit skewed, it's the complete opposite of what you and I have been
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.900]   taught since we were very little kids.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.380]   Why we were taught to study, why we need to get good jobs, why you need to go to a good
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.060]   university, why you need to get good grades, it goes directly against all of that.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.520]   Think about all the difficult things of sanctification.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.740]   And I think at the core of the message that if you really think about it, that would be
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.640]   very difficult to accept, is this salvation by grace alone?
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.940]   That in and of itself, it flies directly against everything that you and I naturally believe
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.740]   in this world.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.300]   All of it is completely unnational, by faith alone.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.720]   Because you and I are taught if you're good, you get rewarded.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.580]   And if you're bad, you get punished.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.740]   And then the gospel message comes in and says, that's not it at all.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:54.340]   In fact, if you add works in any part of our salvation, if you add works to any part of
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.500]   our justification before God, you're a heretic.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   That is not the gospel.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.460]   In fact, the whole book of Galatians is written for that purpose.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.700]   Because the Judaizers were trying to say, you need to believe in Jesus, and then you
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.100]   need to do all these other things, get circumcised and celebrate these festivals.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.820]   And he says, no, that's heresy.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.380]   If anybody preaches you a different gospel, a skewed gospel, other than the one I've already
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.580]   preached to you, let him be absolutely anathema.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.460]   And he says it twice in verse 18 and 19, in chapter 1.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:31.420]   So that idea-- again, think about where else do you practice that?
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.820]   Do you ever tell that to your kids?
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.300]   Whatever you do, it doesn't matter.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.420]   Outside of teaching them the gospel, do you ever say that to your kids?
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.220]   It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you believe.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.540]   Outside of the belief in gospel and entrance into the kingdom, have you ever said that
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.540]   to anybody?
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.540]   To your coworkers?
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.740]   To your coworkers?
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.580]   If you're a schoolteacher, do you ever mention that to your kids?
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.060]   It doesn't matter how hard you work in the classroom.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.140]   You get an A or an F, it doesn't matter, because it's not about your work.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.100]   I want you to work, but even if you don't work, it doesn't matter.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.900]   You're all going to get an A. You're all going to get scholarships.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.820]   You're all going to go to the elite schools.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.900]   Where else do you even think of applying that?
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.420]   Outside of the most important thing in our life, which is salvation.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.620]   Eternal salvation and reconnection with our God.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:32.580]   So at the core of the gospel message, it is absolutely unnatural in the flesh, not only
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.700]   to understand it, but to even practice it.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.700]   You can't.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.400]   That's why the scripture says it is spiritually discerned.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.660]   You can't even begin to understand the gospel until there's a regeneration that takes place.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.860]   The Word of God wouldn't make any sense. A natural person who studies the Word of God
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.460]   in his flesh would absolutely reject what it says.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.900]   And it's a wonder in the flesh why so many Christians accept it without ever truly believing
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.980]   it.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.820]   Of all the things that we can talk about that is unnatural for people to accept and to even
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.980]   practice, I think that the most difficult, the most unnatural of all the things that
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.300]   Christ commanded us to do is to love.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.960]   And even though as fundamental as it is, and even though we do see it, even a non-Christian
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:37.260]   practices love to a certain degree, but this call to love as he loved us, it is so unnatural.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:44.220]   And just as we don't teach anybody outside of the gospel message itself that your good
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.500]   works doesn't matter, we would never say that to anybody else outside of the context of
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.060]   justification.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:58.220]   What Jesus tells us to do, to love as he loved, as he loved, not just any kind of love, not
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.140]   the love that the world we naturally practice, but the love that he tells us to love, it
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.620]   is so unnatural when you really understand it.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.380]   It is impossible to practice in your flesh.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.580]   Imagine what he says.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.620]   Look at in verse 13, just as a quick review.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:23.020]   He says in practicing love, he says, "Contribute to the needs of the saints."
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.020]   Contribute to the needs of the saints.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.420]   We talked about how that is talking about partnership.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.780]   A few people are naturally generous, a few.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.900]   That's been my experience.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.580]   There are some very generous people in our church.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.020]   And you can't tell because they never tell people.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.460]   People who are like, they're very frugal with their finances, and when they go out to eat,
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.860]   they get the cheapest stuff, and you see it.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.340]   They're always frugal with their money, but when it's time to give, when they're really
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.900]   convicted, man, a fat check comes out.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.980]   But that's very few.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:00.740]   Few people are just naturally, or maybe unnaturally, very generous.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.900]   Understandably so.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.380]   Understandably so because your money represents your time.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.260]   Your money represents hard work.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.020]   Your money represents a good chunk of your life.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:19.900]   And there's a reason why God says to demonstrate lordship through finances because finances
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.540]   are very dear to our hearts.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.940]   We treasure it.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.500]   You may never get money and just lay it around the house.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.500]   You treasure it.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.500]   You lock it up.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.500]   You put it in the bank.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.300]   You earn the proper interest.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.900]   No human being is completely reckless with money.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.980]   If you are, you'd get into trouble.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.980]   So the very first thing about contributing to the need of the saints, again, this is
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.140]   not something somebody can just naturally, just normally do.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.340]   The second thing is even harder.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:57.100]   When it says to show hospitality, remember we talked about hospitality is not just getting
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.580]   your friends over to your house and hanging out late and you just love to have events
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.580]   at your house.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.660]   It's not talking about that.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:10.360]   Hospitality is philozenos, which means to love strangers, people that you wouldn't normally
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:18.700]   have at your house, people that you may not know well, simply because they are in need.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:24.420]   Hospitality, a lot of people, even within the church, they fantasize about hospitality
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.020]   like, "Oh, we want to feed the poor.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.780]   We need to be concerned about all these poor children, all these countries who don't have
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.700]   water and these orphans who don't have parents."
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:42.260]   And it's easy to stir people up because there's need and we want to be benevolent.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.580]   When the rubber meets the road, this is probably one of the hardest things to practice because
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.180]   hospitality basically, it doesn't mean to write a little check and send it over and
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.380]   clear your conscience and feel good about yourself.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.180]   Hospitality is to pursue, remember?
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:03.460]   He used the word pursue, go after, and to bring them near to you.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:09.260]   I remember years ago when Esther and I, we were heavily involved with the homeless ministry
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.620]   and there's maybe one or two people in our church that may remember because it was a
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.260]   long time ago.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.240]   And I became friends with a few of the guys out on the streets and then we were trying
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.180]   to help them get off the street.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.940]   And then so we brought them to church.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:28.220]   And so there were at least two guys who I met on the street, we got them off the street,
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.340]   got them an apartment, got them a job.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.020]   And so they were a regular part of our church.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.100]   And one guy for maybe a year and a half and another guy, he came maybe about three months
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.940]   while he was on the streets and then another two years after he got off the street, he
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.940]   was part of our church.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.860]   And again, not Berean, it was a previous church that I was at.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:55.260]   But I remember the frustration that I felt because everybody was so excited that we got
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.100]   people off the streets and we all, you know, and when we say we, we're talking about the
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.300]   church, right?
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   And they were so excited, "Our church helps the homeless, our church does this, our church,"
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.640]   until they actually came into the church.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.540]   And then they have to go eat and they don't have money, so they always have to pay for
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.540]   them.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.540]   "Go play basketball."
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.540]   They don't have shoes, so we had to get them shoes.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:21.220]   You know, and it only lasted for a couple of months before people started feeling uncomfortable.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:27.180]   It's another thing to have them in there, but to be in the regular part of the fellowship,
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.500]   you know?
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.940]   And then I remember there was a guy that we felt comfortable enough, this is before we
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.380]   had kids, we felt comfortable, this guy was struggling.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.500]   His name was Michael and he was really struggling, but it's a guy that I've spent a lot of time
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.700]   with, probably six, seven months doing Bible study with him and he was hooked on crack.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.860]   But he became a part of our church, he would play basketball and we'd hang out with him
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.180]   and he just like, he'd be doing fine for three, four months.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.260]   And then he would just drift off and disappear for a week and then he showed up, show up
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.260]   and he got caught up in crack for a week.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:09.180]   Sold his shoes or bike that we got for him and then he would come crying and, you know,
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.180]   felt bad for him.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.180]   So we tried everything.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.340]   And in the end, nothing worked.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.700]   So eventually, in order to keep him accountable, I brought him into my house.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.260]   So he stayed with us for about three months, you know?
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.540]   And I remember when that happened, you know, obviously it was very uncomfortable.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.540]   Again, I didn't think I was making a huge risk.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.820]   I already knew him for about a year before we did that and this is before we had kids.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.460]   And Esther would be gone most part of the day, so she doesn't come back until I'm home,
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.020]   so she was never alone with him.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:44.260]   But I remember during that period, the various responses I got from people, you know, and
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.260]   initially it's like, "What?
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.260]   What are you doing?"
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.060]   And he's like, "Peter, I know, you know, you're being irresponsible.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.060]   You're being irresponsible.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.820]   That's your wife in there.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.820]   What if, what if?
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.820]   He's on crack.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.060]   What is he going to do?"
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:03.780]   And I remember being thoroughly discouraged during that period, you know, because majority
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.300]   of the response was, "It's good that you're doing homeless, maybe to church, but to your
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   house?
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.300]   Are you crazy?
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.300]   Right?
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.060]   It's something you're, you got to screw loose.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.780]   You need to be a better husband.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.780]   What is that?"
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:27.460]   You know, when we talk about pursuing strangers, pursuing strangers, just even from the response,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.460]   it's very unnatural.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:36.340]   It's not normal to give away your comfort for somebody that you don't even know.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:44.420]   So what Christ is asking us to do by our own effort is extremely unnatural, maybe even
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.540]   burdensome.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.900]   But up to this point, even the world practices some of that.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.580]   You have people like Greenpeace, right?
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:01.780]   A lot of non-Christians contribute to their brothers and sisters, right?
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.780]   They're generous.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.580]   You hear a lot of athletes, they become millionaires, and "What's the first thing you did?"
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.340]   "I bought my mom a house," or "I brought my brother, paid for his tuition."
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.380]   And so non-Christians practice that.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.620]   Even giving to strangers.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:20.340]   You hear about, whether it's Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and these millionaires
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:27.780]   are sports stars or movie stars, or even not movie stars.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.740]   The lot of non-Christians practice, even though it's difficult, they practice going after
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.220]   strangers, homeless, give to the orphans.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:48.380]   But what he calls us to do in verse 14, in verse 14, outside of Christianity, I've never
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.420]   even heard of it.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.420]   I've never even heard of it.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:58.660]   This is, the other two, as difficult as it is, what he tells us to do in verse 14, "Bless
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:05.940]   those who persecute you and do not curse them."
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:12.980]   The word for persecute here is the same word that he uses in verse 13, to pursue.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:18.580]   He says to pursue the strangers, and the word for persecute here is the one who pursues
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.580]   you.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.780]   Immediately, I think of Apostle Paul when he was persecuting the Christians, where it
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.140]   wasn't enough for him to persecute the Christians in Jerusalem.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.940]   He got permission from the leaders of that time, and he got a small army and chased him
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.540]   all the way to Damascus.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.620]   You have to understand the distance between Jerusalem to Damascus would have been about
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.300]   three days' journey.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:45.780]   He took an army, and he heard that they were over in Damascus, and he committed his time,
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.840]   his money, his energy, his life to go get them.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.460]   So the idea of persecutors are not just simply just people who are just passive, saying,
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.740]   "Oh, I don't like that guy," "Oh, I don't like Christians in my neighborhood."
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:04.220]   He's talking about people who have determined to bring you harm, and he's committing to
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.220]   come after you.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.340]   That's who he's talking about when he says to bless these people.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:17.060]   Now we hear, this is not new to Paul, Jesus himself says that.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:22.180]   In fact, that is taught all throughout Scripture.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:28.820]   To bless those who are actively committed to harm you.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:35.300]   It's one of those commands that are so difficult to practice, or impossible to practice, that
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.640]   we don't even think that Jesus is serious.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.260]   We just automatically think, "Of course he doesn't expect that.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.260]   Come on.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.360]   It's hard to even love people around us.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.420]   Sometimes it's so hard to love our family members."
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.580]   And then every once in a while you see people who are going after strangers, it's like,
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.580]   "Wow, that's a saint.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.380]   He committed his life to help people that he doesn't know."
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:05.020]   But to bless those who are actively committed to harm you?
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.980]   Impossible.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.820]   So a lot of times the way we respond is we don't even try it.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.140]   Because clearly that's not what he means.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.500]   It's one of those superlative things when Jesus says, "If you're struggling against
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.460]   sin and your hand causes you to sin, cut it off."
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.380]   He didn't mean to cut it off.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.380]   Gouge your eyes out.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.020]   He didn't really mean to gouge it out.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.740]   That's not what he means, right?
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.260]   He couldn't possibly really want us to practice this.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:39.520]   See, at the core of human nature, at the core of human rebellion, at the core of our sin
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.820]   against God, is self-preservation, self-gratification, self-glorification.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:53.740]   So an individual who is actively pursuing to harm you is your enemy because he is actively
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:59.500]   trying to prevent you from self-gratification, self-preservation, and self-glorification,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.460]   whether through their words or whether through their action.
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:11.300]   So this command to bless those people, not to curse those people who are actively pursuing
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:19.580]   and to bring you down is as difficult and as strange as you can possibly think, what
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.460]   the Scripture is telling us.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:28.300]   How can we even begin to entertain applying this?
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.500]   See, this is not something that you and I could do in our flesh.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.860]   We are called not only to bless them but not to curse them.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.940]   You know, the word for bless is where we get the word eulogy, right?
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.820]   Good word, that's what it literally means.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.280]   So when it says to bless them, he's basically saying to get on your knees to pray for them.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.060]   You and I are not the final authorities.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.420]   We don't go around saying, "Bless you, I bless you.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.420]   I don't have holy water to bless people that I don't like."
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.020]   Basically what he's saying is put in a good word to get on your knees to pray for them.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:05.220]   And then to not to curse them is to check your heart, right?
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.060]   Desiring to bring harm.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.620]   And isn't that the first thing that we do when somebody hurts us?
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.620]   It comes out of our mouth.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.220]   "That guy's like this, that guy's like that."
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:22.140]   And it's so hard to control because our natural tendency when somebody harms us is vengeance.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.100]   So if you look at all the Old Testament laws, some of it is very harsh.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.220]   Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, you know, limb for limb, you know, life for life.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:37.940]   And it seems harsh, but it was actually God being very gracious because he knows that
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.780]   our natural tendency is not justice, but vengeance.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:49.340]   If somebody slaps me deliberately, is it enough to slap them back?
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.300]   Probably not.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:56.460]   Would your anger be appeased if he like that and you had, "Well, how dare you?"
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:03.180]   And then, you know, your anger has been satisfied because you did to him what he did to you.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.460]   No.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:10.980]   Because our natural tendency is when we're angry, he hits me, I punch him.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.980]   How dare you?
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.260]   You do it again, I mean, something more serious is going to come because our natural
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:21.380]   tendency because we can't just, you know, we're not satisfied with righteousness.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.860]   We want vengeance.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.820]   So if you look at the Old Testament laws, it was actually putting parameters to our
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:36.020]   anger to temper our natural tendency for vengeance.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.620]   Let's be honest, that's who we are, right?
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:44.500]   When our anger comes up, it's not easily appeased by, "Well, you took $5, I'm going to take
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.820]   your $5," "No, you took $5, I'm going to take your car."
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:52.140]   Is that too much?
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.060]   You understand what I'm saying.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:23:04.420]   So for God to call us, not only to like to withhold anger, but to actually bless them,
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.820]   to come before God and plead on their behalf.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:13.060]   If there's anything that you cannot practice in the flesh is this, you think prayer is
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.060]   hard?
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.580]   You think you can't sit with somebody that's actively trying to harm you?
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.140]   You think giving is hard?
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.420]   You know, finances, you think that's difficult?
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:30.340]   Try to practice blessing upon somebody who's actively trying to harm you.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.980]   You and I have to admit and be honest, it's impossible.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.580]   It's impossible.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:42.220]   The best that you could do is to not punch them.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.500]   The best that you might be able to do is to keep your mouth shut, even though anger and
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.620]   vengeance is in your heart.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.300]   So how do we understand this?
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.460]   Why does he even command this, knowing how difficult it is, knowing how impossible it
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.980]   is in our flesh?
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.940]   When he says to bless and to curse, immediately a Jew would have probably thought in his mind
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.340]   the Old Testament covenant, because the Old Testament covenant was about the blessing
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.580]   and cursing.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.380]   So when Paul says to bless and not to curse, the imagery immediately for a Jew would have
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:20.900]   been at that mountain when God says, "If you trust me, if you obey me, here's the blessings.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:26.780]   And then if you don't obey me and you break my commands, here's all these curses."
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.180]   When we read that, I don't know about you, when we read that, it's like, "Wow, that's
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.180]   intense.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.860]   All that cursing.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.940]   All that judgment that's going to come down on them because they weren't obedient."
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:43.380]   And when we think of that as a party just kind of looking in from the outside, it's
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.620]   like, "Wow, that was really harsh."
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:55.660]   The only reason why we think that is because something else has been ingrained in our mind,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.420]   which I'm going to get to later.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:03.940]   But naturally, we all think that that's righteousness.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.260]   Naturally.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.340]   If you work hard and you stayed up all night, memorized all the stuff, you should get an
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:15.460]   A. You don't go out and stay out and watch movies all night and hang out with your friends
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.820]   and then you drink, you know, did whatever you want and show up and then you get an A.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.940]   So that's not fair.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.660]   The people who worked hard and obeyed and did the right things, they should be rewarded.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.920]   And the people who disobeyed and then did whatever they wanted, they should be cursed.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.180]   So immediately, that fits well with how the world functions.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.300]   All other religions practice that very principle.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.300]   If you're good, outweigh the bad.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.820]   There is better life for you.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.180]   There's reincarnation.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:51.420]   Every religion outside of the gospel teaches that because it fits right in with our sense
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.500]   of justice.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.940]   So a Jew would have understood, you know, to bless them, not to curse them.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.540]   They would have thought, "Wait a second.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.900]   God told us."
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.620]   You're supposed to bless those who are good to you and curse those who aren't good to
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.620]   you.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.580]   But what Paul is saying is not of the old covenant.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.060]   The old covenant passed.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.500]   And that's what the whole 11 chapters of Romans was about.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:21.860]   Whole 11 chapters was basically to teach the old covenant of blessing and cursing has now
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.860]   passed.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:27.420]   Now you're living under the new covenant of His grace.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.560]   And so now when he comes in chapter 12 and he's telling not to curse those people who
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:39.660]   deserve the curse, it's something that we cannot understand with the old covenant mindset.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:47.260]   In our flesh, we cannot understand it.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:54.980]   We think, you know, we would think naturally that that's righteousness until we recognize
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.420]   we're the sinners.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.820]   And I was thinking about, you know, we have several lawyers in our church and we have
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.780]   some prosecutors, you know, and then we have some people in the DA's office.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.100]   And then if you're the public defender, those of you guys who don't know what public defender
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:15.660]   is, public defenders are state mandated or given attorney to represent people who are
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.460]   in trouble, you know, whether they're drug dealers or you stole or you did something
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:25.380]   and then so they can't afford a lawyer so the attorney is given to them from the state.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.900]   So their work is to try their best to get the best deal for somebody who's been convicted
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.220]   of something.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:36.460]   So when we think about a public defender, it's like, ah, this guy is letting, you know,
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.940]   criminals out of jail.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:43.380]   And then we think of the DA as the one who's representing righteous and bad guys in jail.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.660]   That's normally the response, natural normal response that we would get because bad guys
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.000]   should be in jail.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.900]   We want bad guys in jail.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.020]   We don't want them running around.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:28:01.180]   We don't want them harming and getting into our homes and selling, we don't want that.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.480]   Until you get in trouble.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.900]   Until somebody you know that you care about get in trouble.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:13.700]   And all of a sudden the public defender is Jesus.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:21.020]   All of a sudden you get a complete different picture of who is good and who is bad depending
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.580]   on where you stand.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:37.180]   If you are righteous and you are in God's seat, blessing and curse is actually righteousness.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:44.320]   But when you are the sinner and you are in need of someone's forgiveness, all of a sudden
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.040]   the public defender represents Christ.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.720]   He's merciful.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.120]   I know I deserve punishment, but I need mercy.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:01.560]   But the command, the New Testament command to forgive the sinner, naturally, I mean,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:06.320]   again, it's hard for me to understand people who've been raised in the church who proclaim
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.880]   to be Christian who don't wrestle with this thought.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:18.160]   A righteous person who's never done anything wrong was killed and tortured for somebody
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.680]   who's constantly doing wrong.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.320]   You hear stories about how recently there's been stories about police officers getting
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.760]   shot and they're getting killed and a lot of times it was deliberate.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:36.120]   They're responding to a call in a bad neighborhood and some of these guys who need help maybe
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:42.800]   drug dealers in the context of dealing drugs, something went wrong and there was a gunshot
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.600]   and the guy who was sitting on the ground with a gunshot wound that he's coming to help
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.720]   is a bad guy.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.040]   And then it's in that context that they come to this bad neighborhood and they get shot
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   and they get murdered.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:59.520]   And we look at that and we say, "Wow, that is not right.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.800]   Why even go and try to help that guy?"
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:10.080]   In what context would you and I think that a righteous person giving his life for the
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.520]   unrighteous is a good thing?
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.900]   Naturally, our response would be, "That should not be.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.000]   We should never practice that.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.080]   How can that be?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.960]   That's not fair."
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.720]   There should be a natural response, not to the blessings and curses, but what Paul is
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.800]   calling us to do is unnatural.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.920]   What Jesus did for us is absolutely unnatural.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.160]   That's something that you and I should be contemplating.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:51.120]   Why would the righteous, the Son of God, why would he give his life for me?
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:58.720]   The practice of love that he is telling us to practice with one another, it is central
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.600]   to the redemptive message.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.560]   What he's telling us to do is, verse 14, it is at the core of the new covenant.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.640]   It is not just one of many commands.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.480]   It's at the core of the new covenant.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.720]   He tells us to do what he did for us.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.880]   And it is difficult for us to understand, "Why would these perpetrators in my life,
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.620]   why do I have to care for them?
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.000]   Why do I have to pray for them?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.560]   Why do I have to not curse them?
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.800]   That seems unrighteous.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.760]   That seems unfair."
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.440]   But every time we ask that question, we have to ask the bigger question of, "Why did he
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.320]   do that for me?"
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.000]   He asks us and he commands us to do this because it is at the core of the redemptive message
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.600]   that you and I sing about, practice, study, memorize, meditate, and share.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:55.840]   Verse 14 is the gospel message at its core.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.040]   But here's the question.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.200]   If that's the core of the Christian message, the old covenant has gone, the new covenant
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.240]   has come, then who's our enemy?
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.480]   Because I don't know of anybody who's actively pursuing me.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.160]   You know, think about all those poor people in the Middle East.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.440]   You know, the persecution in India, when we first started going just five years ago, four
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.800]   or five years ago, they were on number 27 on the list of places that are hard to live
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   as a Christian.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.200]   They jumped to number 11 just in two years, two or three years.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.840]   And it's climbing fast.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.440]   We say, "Well, thank God."
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.280]   You know, that's the one time a year that we go, you know, we get to kind of get a glimpse.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.640]   And we don't really get persecuted there.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.760]   It's just the idea of getting persecuted kind of, you know, kind of makes us feel uneasy.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.040]   But we don't have that here.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.400]   We don't have persecutors here.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:33:01.800]   Who are our enemies if no one is actively trying to get us?
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:09.920]   And I really want you guys to focus your attention on this part because the reason why this is
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.160]   so significant and important is because the enemies are much closer than you think.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:22.320]   And there's not a single person in this room that doesn't have one or many.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.440]   Think about the fall.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:31.800]   As soon as they fell, right, and because the rebellion on the surface seems like a very
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.320]   small trivial act.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.760]   They disobeyed God and ate fruit that they weren't supposed to eat, right?
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.200]   And from our perspective, it's like, "Wow, the whole judgment of God came upon mankind
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   because of that?"
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.840]   You know, it wasn't simply about the fruit.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:54.440]   It was about a willful rebellion saying, "Lord, I'm going to do what I want to do."
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.640]   It was expressed in this eating of the fruit, but at the core of it, it was a rebellion
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.600]   against God, a willful rebellion against God.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:07.880]   This willful rebellion against God, what was the very first fruit that came out of it?
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   They have children.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.600]   Adam and Eve have children.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   And what happened?
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.800]   Who was the first perpetrator?
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.600]   Who was the first enemy?
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.960]   Cain killed his brother.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.120]   Cain killed his brother.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.520]   So Abel's first persecutor was his brother, home brother.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.000]   It was in his house.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.720]   It was not another continent.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.480]   It wasn't another family, another tribe.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.400]   It was in his own house.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.000]   It was his own brother that drank the same milk, ate the same food, received the same
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.040]   love from the same mom and dad.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.880]   It was his own brother.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.240]   And then, think about Adam and Eve.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   What do you do with that?
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.840]   I mean, if some persecutor comes and kills your child, you want vengeance.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.980]   You want to kill him and his family to make sure that doesn't happen again.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:03.980]   What do you do?
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.760]   Because it's your other son.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.320]   Your other son did this to the other son.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.520]   And now they have to live the rest of their life watching their son being punished.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.640]   One son killed, the other son punished.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.360]   It's a lose-lose situation.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:29.800]   The persecutor was in their own home.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:36.560]   Our enemies are not in foreign countries.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.640]   They're in this room.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.960]   They're the people who are sitting right next to you.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.240]   Oftentimes, it's your mother or father.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.120]   It's your brother or sister.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:36:00.880]   Because at the core of our rebellion is self-preservation, self-gratification, and self-glorification.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:06.200]   Another sinner who is living by that same principle is going to encroach upon your life
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.880]   at some point.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.880]   It's going to encroach upon your reputation.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.260]   It's going to encroach upon your happiness.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:19.480]   Another sinner who is living by that principle is going to get in the way of your life purpose.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.200]   And they are not in foreign countries.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:30.240]   Oftentimes, it's in your own homes.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:37.120]   I remember early on in marriage, I've been married 26 years now.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.240]   Going on 26 years.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:47.460]   I remember early on in marriage, majority of the time, I would say 90% of the time,
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.460]   it was great.
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.160]   Esther was my best friend.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:57.480]   I married her because I'd rather spend time with her than my goofy single friends.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.760]   So I wanted, and I was happy 90% of the time.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.240]   And 95%, I was happy.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:06.480]   But whenever we had a problem, it would never get resolved.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.440]   Her and I are just as polar opposite as you can get.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.000]   The way she communicates, the way I communicate.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.440]   I communicate like I'm on the pulpit, which is not good when you're talking to your wife.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.480]   Thus saith the Lord, the passage says, you know.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.520]   It just doesn't work with your wife.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.520]   And Esther is Esther.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   A lot of you guys don't even know what she looks like.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.320]   She's at the core so introverted, she hides from people.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.080]   And so her and I are like, I'm up here, and she's in some room somewhere hiding.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.440]   That's how polar opposite we are in our personalities.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:47.160]   So whenever conflict came, her first instinct was to go hide.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.560]   My first instinct is to deal with it today, not five minutes later, like right now.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.320]   So you can imagine how frustrating this was for both of us.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:02.880]   And I noticed it in the beginning, but after a while, the frustration started building
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.800]   and building and building.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:12.400]   And I remember, I think it was maybe about five or six years into our marriage.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.640]   You know typically when husband and wife fight, they fight.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.640]   Esther never argues with me.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.820]   It's usually me giving my three-point message.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.240]   And then she would turn her head, try not to make eye contact with me.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.780]   And then the more animated I get, the more she would just kind of disappear.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.400]   The more she disappeared, the more angry I would get.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:37.560]   It would turn into a four-point message, a six-point message.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.960]   And then we're just like, there's no resolution.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.560]   It was like, okay, okay, just calm down.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.560]   And then there's no resolution.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.480]   Wake up, and then you're not as angry.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.920]   And then you just forget, and then you don't want to bring it up.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.880]   Because I don't want to do that again.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.920]   So you just kind of tiptoe around that situation, and then, oh, everything's good.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.600]   I'll take something else, snaps, and then boom, we're right back to where we were.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   Six years of that, right?
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.720]   And I remember I came home.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.680]   It must have been like from a mission trip or something.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.960]   And she had a, you know, like angry face.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.560]   Or at least that's how I interpret it.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.760]   I came home, and she looked angry.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.160]   I'm like, what?
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   What did I do?
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   Again?
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.760]   And I just lost it.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.880]   And she's like, what's going on?
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.480]   And it was at that point.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:26.120]   And I remember thinking to myself, I understand why people get divorced.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.200]   I'm a pastor.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.800]   If I get a divorce, like, it would ruin my life.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.240]   Everything that I believe, everything that I teach, everything that I sacrifice for.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.160]   But I began to understand why people would do it.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.400]   Because it's just that painful.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.160]   You know, to have conflict outside your house is one thing.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:50.520]   To be in the home, on your bed, every time you turn around, and it's nonstop.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.160]   And it's constant.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.440]   And I was at my wits' end.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.040]   And it wasn't like she was doing anything particularly wrong.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.840]   It wasn't like I was sitting against her.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.040]   It was just, I just could not understand her.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.000]   And then she was making me miserable, and I was making her miserable.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.840]   And I remember just sitting, just sighing and praying, Lord, help me.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.880]   And then I started memorizing a passage that I memorized when I was in high school and
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.000]   college in Galatians 2.20.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.400]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.800]   The life I live now, I live in the faith of the Son of God who loves me and died for me.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.880]   And I started memorizing that over and over again.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:40.080]   And I started to tell myself, Peter, die first.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.400]   You die first.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.840]   And I know, like everything in me is like, no, but it's not fair.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.040]   Look at what she's doing to me.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.880]   I'm trying to serve God, and she's making it difficult.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.120]   And, you know, she needs to change.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.320]   It's like, no, Peter, die.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.680]   Die to yourself.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.960]   Die to yourself.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.800]   And I started thinking like, well, how do I do that?
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.720]   Well, approach her like you would approach your daughter.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.240]   You know, like imagine, you know, at that time, faith was probably like an infant or
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.800]   maybe one at most.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.200]   And I said, if faith did something to me, what I thought and I believe with all my
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.800]   heart she was wrong, I wouldn't go and just to punish her.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.760]   I'd have to come, because if I did, I would ruin her, right?
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.080]   If I get my full vent to my anger.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.200]   And I started to tell myself like, okay, what would I do?
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.160]   Well, I need to correct her, but I need to correct her in a way that she actually is
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.200]   going to learn from that.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.760]   So I remove myself.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.360]   Like what does, you know, if I'm supposed to be the Christ in this relationship,
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.920]   like what does she need of Christ, right?
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.360]   Not like what do I need, but what does she need?
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:52.200]   So I decided that I'm going to put aside all my anger and bitterness and frustration.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.240]   I'm going to put that aside and I'm going to kill it for the moment.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:02.080]   And I'm going to approach her like her father and just hold her hand and say,
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.480]   "Are you okay?
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.040]   Like what's going on?"
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.680]   That's it.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.080]   That was it.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.640]   And so I went and I...
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.280]   Trust me, inside of me, I had an eight-point message that I had in my mind that I was
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.000]   like, "If you poke me, it will come out," you know, like, but I'm holding it in.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.720]   Like I'm holding it in.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:26.680]   And I had like 15 verses that she needed to hear, you know, and then I'm holding it in.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   And so I just go in and I said, "Okay, just be there."
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.400]   And then I just held her hands, "Are you okay?
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.720]   Is everything okay?"
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.280]   And I could tell her response was completely different than all the other times I'd
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.640]   approached her.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.200]   She would normally...
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.680]   I said, "What's going on?"
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.880]   And then you could see her body starting to turn away from me.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:52.440]   But for the first time, she started turning toward me and she leaned against me because
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.240]   she felt safe.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.920]   And then, you know, obviously, she started crying and it's like, "Should I tell her now?"
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.840]   You know?
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.920]   I said, "Be quiet.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.680]   Be quiet."
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.880]   You know, and then I kept my tongue, kept my tongue.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.240]   And then, you know, she would cry it out and afterwards, "Is everything okay?"
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.520]   And then I found out something happened.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.320]   You know, like maybe the kids were acting up or she got a nasty phone call or something
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:16.560]   happened.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.800]   It had nothing to do with me.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.080]   You know, I mean, at that moment, it had nothing to do with me.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.880]   You know, but it was just so frustrating because she had such a hard time communicating
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.480]   with me because she felt unsafe.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:35.680]   Because I was expressing my anger, she's encroaching upon my space, and then I'm encroaching
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.360]   upon her the way I'm reacting.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:43.720]   And I remember thinking like, "Wow, it's this hard."
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:50.880]   The reason why I share this story with you is that the sin that encroaches upon our lives
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.720]   isn't that far away.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:01.400]   And the reason why Jesus says to practice this is because at the core of redemption,
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:08.680]   the core of the reversal of this curse, the most tangible evidence of this you will see
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.480]   in your own marriage with your own kids.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.960]   If you do not learn and to practice love with people who you don't think deserves it, you
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.120]   will eventually begin to see the fruit of that in your own marriage.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:26.000]   You will begin to eventually see that with your own kids.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.320]   You will begin to see that with your friends.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:35.240]   If you're in the practice of only loving people who are easy to love, you are probably already
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.180]   isolated from other people.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.480]   Because basically, you cut off everybody that's difficult to love, and you find yourself that
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:50.560]   there's nobody worth loving but yourself, even within the own family.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:45:01.680]   The ramification of the curse of mankind, you see it unfolding in the closest of relationships
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:10.880]   with your closest friends, with your coworkers, with your church friends, eventually.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:17.360]   See this call to love our enemies would be a cruel enslavement if he didn't give us the
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.560]   capacity to love.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.120]   We are the recipients of this love in Christ.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.440]   In Romans 5, 8, he demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet hostile,
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.800]   while we were yet sinners, he loved us.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:36.040]   The first and foremost, our motivation is that we ourselves have been recipients of
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.040]   this love.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.180]   He pursued sinners, enemies, and he gave us an example to follow.
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.800]   Not only that, in 2 Corinthians 5, 17, he gave us a new heart.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.260]   We are given a changed heart to be able to even receive this command.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:54.640]   The reason why you're even sitting here and any of this is even making sense to you is
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.620]   because God has already given you a new heart.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.220]   In Romans 8, it says we have been given the Holy Spirit that is constantly interceding
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:06.900]   on our behalf, groaning with words that we cannot even begin to comprehend because God
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:12.580]   knew that we needed the Holy Spirit for redemption.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:18.700]   We are given the motivation as a reward that the harder it is for us to practice this love,
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.900]   the greater the reward in heaven.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:32.440]   Agape love may seem at first to be the greatest burden, but the application of it at the core
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.060]   is the redemption and reversal of the curse of man.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:47.860]   I hope it really sinks in because he's not simply telling us what is impossible to do.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:53.060]   What he's commanding is something that we cannot have.
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.300]   You cannot live without it.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.300]   It is at the core of our redemption.
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.980]   It is at the core of redeeming our families.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.980]   It is at the core of redeeming our children.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.900]   It is at the core of redeeming our friendship.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.260]   It is at the core of redeeming mankind.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.900]   What he did on the cross wasn't simply justification.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:18.260]   What he did was an example for us.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.720]   The only way that mankind can be reversed.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.260]   How do you deal with sinful people?
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.660]   The only way that we know how is what Jesus did.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.100]   He ran toward us and not away from us.
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.540]   I pray that that truth would sink in, and I'm sure some of you guys can think right
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.820]   now of some people who are encroaching upon your space.
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:45.700]   Maybe it's your wife, maybe it's your husband, maybe it's your kids, maybe it's a friend
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.500]   at church, a co-worker.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.580]   Don't forget.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.380]   Don't forget who we are.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.660]   Don't forget what we have received.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:59.460]   The preaching of the gospel must be more than just our words.
