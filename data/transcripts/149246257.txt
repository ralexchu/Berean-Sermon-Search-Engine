[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   But if you look at chapter 11, chapter 11 verse 1 through 9 is basically about the Messiah
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.680]   coming. The child's going to be born, what it's going to be like. So the question that
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.760]   I ask is, "Describe the promise of hope given to Israel through the roots of Jesse in verses
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.560]   1 through 5." So what I would like you to do is, because you have three weeks, you don't
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.080]   need to do Thursday just Thursday. You can take Thursday and Friday just to meditate
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.720]   this chapter, chapter 11, 1 through 9. And if you look at the second question, it says,
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.160]   "Name specific things that you remember in the life and person of Jesus that fulfills
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.600]   these promises specifically." So if you took time and actually went through this, you could
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.120]   probably find about 10 to 15 things that are actually fulfilled in Christ. And I'm not
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.760]   talking about like, "Okay, he's going to bring peace." Yes, he was peaceful. You know what
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.240]   I mean? Like Jesus came and he didn't go to war. You can do that off the top of your head.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.600]   Or what I really encourage you to do is take the opportunity that you have as we are headed
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.720]   toward Christmas and preparing for the Christmas day and to get your heart ready. I know some
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.320]   of you moms have been copying the Advent texts every day. But what I really want you guys
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.880]   to do is take that opportunity from now until Christmas and really meditate on, in particular,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.040]   this text, chapter 11, and go through each detail. So give me an example. "There shall
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.960]   come forth shoot from the stump of Jesse, the branch from his roots shall bear fruit."
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.220]   So, okay, so in what way did he come? Okay, take some time to look through the genealogy
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.880]   of Matthew chapter 1 and what are some highlights. "And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.840]   him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding." So in what part of Jesus' life do you recognize
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.240]   that in the Gospels, right? Where was it clearly evident of his wisdom? Where was it clearly
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.800]   evident of the Spirit being upon him that he was a great counselor? Knowledge and fear
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.680]   of the Lord was upon him. Where is that fulfilled in Jesus' life? "His light shall be in the
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.560]   fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes sees." So in other words, that he
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.800]   didn't just consider what was right and wrong based upon what everybody else saw, he saw
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.920]   beyond that, right? So where are these examples? So some of you guys, or a lot of you guys
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.240]   may know just off the top of your head and say, you could probably think of an example,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.320]   and you say, "Oh, he did this, and this is an example." But what I want you guys to do
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.440]   is take time to comb through the Gospels and see how much of this you can find in the New
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.320]   Testament. Do you get my question? Okay? Now if I ask you to do this on a normal week,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.840]   obviously that would be way too much for you to do, but because this is really three weeks,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.200]   right? You can take a whole week just doing this, right? So you don't have to follow Thursday,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.480]   Friday, Saturday, I just labeled it like that, but I really want you guys to take some time
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.580]   to really wrestle through Chapter 11. So even if it takes you a week and a half to two weeks
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.640]   just to do Chapter 11. But by the time you get to Chapter 12, Chapter 12, 13, will go
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.200]   by pretty quick. More Chapter 13. So by the time you get to Tuesday, Wednesday, those
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.480]   questions are a lot like the other questions that you have. It's pretty straightforward.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.120]   If you read it and you put some thought into it, you can answer it pretty quick. But Chapter
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.560]   11 and Chapter 12 require some meditation. Okay? You get it? Okay. So, again, I'm going
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.200]   to say it again. The memory verse, please jot it down if you don't have it, the memory
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.760]   verse for the next three weeks is Isaiah Chapter 11, verses 1 through 5. Okay? So I made it
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.600]   short on purpose. Because it's three weeks worth. It should have been like six verses,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.560]   but I gave you five. So you're welcome. Okay? Yeah. So just, I think, you know, obviously,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.640]   it just kind of, I didn't plan that way. It's like, oh, we're going to land on Chapter 11
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.800]   when we take Christmas break. But God sovereignly planned it that way, right? We believe in
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:12.080]   predestination. So it's been predestined. So take some time to do that. Okay? All right.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.400]   All the papers have been handed out. So if you didn't get one to fill out, just raise
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.000]   your hand and there's plenty left over on the tables. And then if you ask for an electronic
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   copy and you didn't get one, that means for whatever reason, I didn't, you're not on the
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.200]   list. So you need to ask, you need to tell me. Okay? Did you ask? Okay. Anyway, whoever
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.040]   asked and you didn't get it, let me know. When I'm done with the teaching, I'll go back
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:49.440]   and I'll add you and I'll send it to you. Okay. All right. So we're in Chapter 9 and
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:05:03.680]   11. All right, let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this evening. We thank you,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.120]   Lord God, for your graciousness. We thank you, Lord God, for your love that sustains
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.080]   and guides us that despite our shortcomings, we thank you that you motivate us and inspire
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.680]   us by your humility, by your grace. And we ask Lord God that as we study your word, help
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   us Lord that whatever thoughts that we have of who you are, how you view your people,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.600]   your righteousness, holiness, your judgment, that all of these things, Lord God, would
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.920]   not be based upon our own prejudice or things that we may have heard or imagined, but that
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.680]   our thoughts may be renewed by your living word, that whether it is your grace or your
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.320]   severity, that all of it would be founded and washed according to your word. And so
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.640]   for that end, we pray for your blessing. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. All right. So we're
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.800]   looking at Chapter 10, 9 and 10. And not all the chapters break out in this kind of neat
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:33.160]   order, but Chapter 9 and 10 happens to work out that way. All right. Can you check in
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.440]   and take that out and put that back in?
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:07:03.000]   All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:24.800]   Do you have batteries?
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:54.480]   That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:14.840]   Thank you. Okay. Hey, you know what? I forgot. Did you guys check up on your memory? All
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   right. You're going to have to do that at the end. All right. When you guys get together
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.680]   in your group, you guys can check up on your memory. All right. So Matthew 10, 28, Jesus
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.560]   says, "And do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.280]   him who can destroy both soul and body in hell." And this probably summarizes verse
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:43.920]   Chapter 9 and 10, where Chapter 9 is again, a judgment upon the nation of Israel, even
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.040]   though the beginning of it, we talk about his promise of the coming Messiah. But Chapter
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.720]   9, after that, it pretty much to Chapter 10, verse 4, is judgment coming upon the nation
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.560]   of Israel. Right? And basically what does he say? In the end, the judgment that came,
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   the Assyrians came and they conquered you. But who is the ultimate judge? Who is he telling
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.560]   them to fear? God, right? It's not the Assyrians that you should fear. You should fear God.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.520]   And then Chapter 10 talks about to the Assyrians, how even though they conquered, ultimately
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.680]   judgment is coming upon them because they didn't recognize who the real God was. Right?
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.260]   So in the end, I think Chapter 10, 28, Matthew 10, 28, pretty much summarizes what the teaching
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.600]   that he's about to teach in Chapter 9 and 10. Okay. So again, just like last week, we're
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.080]   going to go down the questions and some of the questions are going to be obviously pretty
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.480]   easy. Some of them I'm going to spend a little bit more time. The first one is, "What change
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.120]   from their present condition does Isaiah predict in 9, 1, and 2?" And so again, if you look
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:52.340]   at it, Chapter 9, "But there will be no gloom for who was in anguish in the former time
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.760]   he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali. But in the latter
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.800]   time he has made glorious the way of the sea and land beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.520]   The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwelt in the land,
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.840]   deep darkness on them has light shine." So if you look at it, the territories that are
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.320]   mentioned Zebulun and Naphtali was the starting point of a serious conquest of Israel. So
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:26.480]   in other words, he's saying that these lands that were conquered, right, in former time
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.880]   he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun, but in latter time he made it glorious. So
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:37.240]   he's going to turn it around, right? So he's about to introduce the solution to their problem.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.200]   So "Though Israel has experienced gloom and anguish, God will defeat their enemies and
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.800]   turn gloom into joy, darkness will turn into great light." So he's, again, he's setting
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:55.960]   it up for the coming of the Messiah. "So in what ways is the coming of the kingdom of
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.280]   justice and righteousness mentioned in 9.7?" So again, you know, the whole point of all
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.320]   of this is he's bringing relief, right, for the judgment that came upon the nation of
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.680]   Israel. That the poor and the helpless, they were widowed, and again, because it was institutional
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.760]   oppression, when the Messiah comes, he says the government is going to be ruling, God's
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:28.960]   going to be ruling in fairness and justice and righteousness, right? So again, you think
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.800]   about the Messiah, the Messiah's going to come and he's going to not only affect individually,
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.040]   but he's going to affect the society, right? So God's solution to a violent nation's conquest
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:50.680]   is not greater army. So he's saying, is it hard to see? There's nothing I can do about
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:12:01.480]   it now. Can you, are you going to? Huh? If you change the background to like white? No,
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:09.920]   no, no, then the text will turn, because there's no color in the text, it'll just turn to black,
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:22.960]   I think. Really, you can't see? No, but you can't see? You can see it? Sang, can you see
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:32.880]   it? No. Actually, that's a young, fresh group on this side. Can you guys see it? Oh, you
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.560]   can't see it either? Okay. Just switch the background to white or beige. All right, I'll
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:45.840]   never use that again. I used black before, you guys had no problem. Black was okay, but
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:54.280]   blue and red is no good? Okay. Note to self. Is that better? Did you just turn it black
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:16.800]   or did you turn it white? Okay. All right. So that's better. Yeah? Okay, very good. So
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.120]   what I want you to notice is, God basically tells the nation of Israel that a superpower
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.760]   has come and they destroyed you, and here are the cities, and at one point they were
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.880]   destroyed, but God's going to turn it into joy, and then all of this is a setup for the
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.280]   Messiah is going to come. Messiah is going to come and do this, right? He says His name
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.440]   is going to be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.480]   Peace. Now, what's unique about this is that obviously, you know, oftentimes names in the
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:53.080]   Bible are used to kind of characterize what God's going to do, or it would say, you know,
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.920]   God will save, God will provide, and so God's name is in a lot of people's names. But the
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.760]   title that is given to the Messiah that's coming is not just about God is going to come
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.940]   and do this, or God's going to judge, or God's going to deliver. It actually is just a name
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:15.840]   of God. Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. So obviously, you
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.600]   know, us in the covenant on this side, we look at this, and this is not just a title
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.640]   of Jesus. This is Jesus. This is who He is, right? And part of the reason why we believe
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:31.120]   that He's the second person of the Trinity. This title cannot be given to just anybody,
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:37.400]   right? And so the hope that He's going to bring to the Messiah is not freedom. He doesn't
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   simply say that here's the oppressor, He came and He's ruling over you. He said, but the
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:49.000]   Messiah is going to come, and He's going to rule over you, right? So the answer to oppression
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.400]   is not another king that's going to conquer, I mean, is going to come and conquer, get
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.120]   rid of them, and so you can be free to do whatever you want, right? He says the answer
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:06.480]   to the oppressor is to bring a good king. Not no king, but a good king, right? And that's,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.960]   again, oftentimes as Christians, what we miss, you know, concerning our sanctification, the
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.360]   second aspect about our salvation is not, we're not just freed from sin. What does the
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.840]   Bible say? We're freed from sin. We were once slaves of sin, and we've been freed from that,
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:29.320]   and now we're slaves of what? Slaves of righteousness. So we were once under the dominion of darkness,
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.120]   now we're under the dominion of the light. We were once under Satanic kingdom, but now
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.560]   we're under the kingdom of Jesus, right? So the answer to the oppression isn't freedom
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:49.080]   to do whatever you want. It is to be, to have a ruler that is good and just, right? And
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:57.660]   that's how the Messiah is described for us. Why is the judgment coming upon the nation
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:04.160]   of Israel? So from this point on, basically God is describing to Israel, here's what has
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.440]   happened. There's four reasons are given, between chapter 9, 8 to chapter 10, verse
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:24.960]   4. How would you describe the first section, verses 8 through 12? Now how do we know there's
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:38.160]   four separate ones? At the end of each one of these four, how does it end? Okay, so if
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.080]   you've read it through, you should have noticed that that phrase is repeated at the end of
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:49.020]   every one of these judgments, right? So the first section is in verse 8 through 12. So
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:59.520]   what is the sin, first sin that's mentioned? Pride, right? Or arrogance. And how was their
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:28.560]   pride and arrogance described? How was their pride manifested in verses 8 through 12? Right.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   So, the first one is pride. Pride is the wisdom of this world. So, the first one is pride.

[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.640]   one is pride. Well, the first round came, the Assyrians came and they basically come
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   to destroy them. They're not completely destroyed, but Assyria comes and they conquer
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.640]   them in some sense. Not completely, not Judah, right? But the northern kingdom is gone, and
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   they're coming, and now they're going to turn on the southern kingdom. They're
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.640]   attacking them. So, that's the first round, right? And instead of humbling them, they
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.640]   become proud and say, "No, we're going to do it right this time." Right? But
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:24.640]   instead of Assyria, who else is coming? Well, that's later, in the text. Look in
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   the text. Okay? What are the nations that are mentioned? Right? Look at the verses.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   Philistines, all the other adversaries, the ones who are enemies of Assyria will
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   become your enemies as well. So, not only Assyria, but the other smaller nations,
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.640]   right? At some point, they were superpowers. They're going to come and get you now.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   Right? In other words, God is saying, remember how it ends? Right? For this is,
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   for all this, His anger has not turned away, and His hand is stretched out still.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.640]   In other words, judgment is, the period of judgment is not over. The Assyrian
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   period is over, but now the Philistines and the other nations are going to come.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   Right? And then ultimately, when you have a nation that is divided and sinful,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   they're devouring each other. Right? And that typically is right before any
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   organization, any family, any group, any friendship that ends, it usually starts
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.640]   with something, you know, and it causes turmoil, and then they infight, and then
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   infighting is what unravels. And that's how God describes the nation of Israel.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   Right? And in the end, who's doing all of this? What's God's point? Who's doing all
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:04.640]   of this? God. Right? God is saying, He's using these adversaries to come and do
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   that, but in the end, part of the reason why judgment is coming is because you
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.640]   don't recognize, I'm behind all of this. Right? Remember how they first responded
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.640]   when judgment started coming, when the other nations started coming? Remember in
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   the very beginning of Isaiah? How did they initially respond? Yes? But think
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   about the text. Think about the text that we're looking at in Chapter 1, the
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   beginning. Remember? Look at Chapter 1. You only have to flip three pages, and
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   what happens? What was their response to the initial judgment that came? What is
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   he angry about? I hate superficial religion, like activity at the temple.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   And he said, what is all of that to me? So the initial response was, hey, maybe go
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   to the temple and offer sacrifices and give prayer, and he says, what is all of
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   that to me when your heart is still filthy and dirty? Right? Your prayers are
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.640]   meaningless, because what he wants is repentance. Right? You don't repent, and
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.640]   you do more religious activity. All it does is anger God even further. Right? So
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   that was their initial response, and so one of the things that they did is, let's
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.640]   be more religious. And that's part of that pride. We're going to do it right this
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   time. Let's establish the right leaders this time. Let's do it right this time.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   Right? Instead, God's saying, you don't realize that I'm the one behind this.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   Right? And part of the reason why he's not done with his judgment is because it
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   didn't lead you to where God wanted you to go, which is to be broken and
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   recognize that God is God. Right? Again, we talked about that, right? And that's
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   the theme of basically Chapter 10. That's the theme of his judgment. It's not
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   like he's not just poking. Remember we talked about that? Just as his grace and
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   mercy is thorough, so is his judgment. The purpose of judgment wasn't just slap
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   on the hand. Right? The rebellion of Israel was so deep, and their hearts were
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.640]   so hardened, that God had to come and hit them over and over and over again.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   Right? So that's how hardened they were. So when the judgment first came, they
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   didn't even see it as judgment. They said, maybe if we strategize. Maybe if we,
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   you know, connect it with Assyria or Egypt or whatever. And they were trying to
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   strategize, using every resource that they had to think that if they were just
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   smart enough, we can get out of this. And they went to religiousness. They aligned
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   themselves with other people. They got, you know, they tried to establish the
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   right leaders. And none of that works. Right? Because in the end, the point that
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   God's trying to make is, you don't recognize that I'm the one. Until you
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   come before me, humble yourself, and repent. Right? God's judgment will be,
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:11.640]   will remain. Chapter 11, he transitions now, not only is Israel wrong, now the
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   Assyrians are now getting arrogant. Right? Not recognizing that God is allowing
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   them to become a power. And how does God describe the Assyrians? As is what?
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   As a tool. It's just an axe that God is wielding to do his work. But the tool
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   begins to think, right? That they're sovereign. Say, hey, we conquered Israel,
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   so we're more powerful than your God. So, basically what God is saying to the
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.640]   nation of Israel is, God's going to humble you. And you see that the only
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.640]   reason why you were powerful is because God was using you as an axe. Right? Now
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:57.640]   God's going to turn his anger toward you. Right? So again, the wrath of God is now
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   directed to Assyrians, who became proud that they were above God of Israel since
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   they conquered them. Right? Not realizing, right, that God is not done with
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   Israel. God still favors Israel over Assyria. But even though there's
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   judgment upon them, God uses Assyria to bring judgment. Right? But that's still
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   his child. It's kind of like, you know, if I took my kid to daycare or something
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   and he's acting up and I tell the teacher, I say, "Hey, spank him if he gets out of
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.640]   line." And the teacher starts to spank him. He's like, "Dude, this is fun." You
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   know what I mean? And he goes out of line and he starts spanking him and spanking
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.640]   him. You know what I mean? He said, "Well, I told you not to do this." And then
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   the dad shows up. He's like, "What are you doing?" Right? He said, "You told me
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.640]   to spank him." He said, "No, to discipline him. What you're doing is beating him
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   up. Now you're abusing him." Right? And so basically that's the picture here.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   Assyria comes in, spanking a nation of Israel, not recognizing it's because God
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   is allowing him to do that. And then these guys start becoming arrogant, thinking
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   like, "Now these guys are all under me." And then he starts abusing them. And the
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   father shows up. He's like, "No." Right? "Now you're going to be judged." And
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   that's chapter 11, or chapter 10. Two conclusions are given through this
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   passage. The judgment God allowed to the Assyrians was temporary. It wasn't
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   permanent. Right? God wasn't done with the nation of Israel. And that's what
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   he's trying to, he's going to remind Assyria, "Those are still my people."
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.640]   Even though, because of their sin, they're being disciplined. Right? Assyria
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   was not operating independently of God's sovereign plan. They were serving God's
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:47.640]   ultimate purpose. Right? So again, if you read 5 and 6, it says, "Ah, Assyria, the rod of my
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   anger, the staff in their hands is my fury. Against godless nation I send him,
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.640]   and against the people of my wrath I command him to take spoil and seize
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the street." In other words,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   everything that you were able to do is because I allowed you. Right? But he does
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.640]   not so intend, and his heart does not so think, but it is in his heart to destroy,
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   and to cut off nations, not a few. In other words, God allowed you to do this, but now
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   you're getting carried away. You're being abusive with your power. Right? That's
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   basically what he's saying. So what would God do? What is the judgment that he's
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.640]   going to bring to the nation of Israel, or Assyria? Again, the first four cities,
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.640]   you know how we talked about the beginning of the judgment upon Israel
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   mentions the cities. The beginning of the judgment upon Assyria mentions the cities.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:44.640]   These are the cities, 9 were mentioned in verse 9, were all fortresses, cities in
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.640]   the northwestern Syria, the outpost of Damascus. These cities were trophies of
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.640]   boast for the king of Assyria. Okay, that's why all the cities are mentioned.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   And God says, "God will humble the arrogance of Syria, Syria's king, and
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:10.640]   wipe out the pride look in their eyes." Okay, and God's going to humble you now.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   In what way was he deluded in his conquest of Judah? So all of these things,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   verse 13 to 15, let's look at that. He said, "For he says, 'By the strength of my
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   hand I have done it.'" In other words, this is Assyria talking about himself.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.640]   The nation is saying, or the king, "By the strength of my hand I have done it,
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.640]   and by my wisdom I have understanding. I remove the boundaries of peoples and
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   plunder their treasures. Like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:49.640]   My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples, and as one gathers eggs
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.640]   that have been forsaken. So I have gathered all the earth, and there was
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   none that moved a wing, or opened a mouth, or chirped." Right? So, again, that's
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.640]   a description of Assyria. Because he experiences all the success, basically
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   he's saying, "I did this. I can move boundaries. I can get these people.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   I can basically do whatever I want." Right? And so, therefore, God comes and he
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   says he's going to humble them. So, again, we see parallels even in the New
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   Testament. The temptation is when, you know, the temptation for the nation of
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   Israel was even when they were being judged, not recognizing that God's hand
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   is upon the judgment. Right? And then the way that he tries to get out of the
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   judgment is by working harder, being smarter. Right? And so, in that way,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   they're being judged even more because God's not done. So, because my discipline
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   isn't working, you're not submitting, so more judgment is coming. Assyria,
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.640]   judgment is coming for the exact opposite reason. They enjoy all this success,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   not recognizing your success is because God was behind you. Right? So, you see
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   the opposite? And the same thing with us. Right? When we don't succeed in
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   something, I mean, we have a tendency to be humble, but a lot of times, what does
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:09.640]   that happen? You know, what happens? We're going to work harder. You know?
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   We're going to make some adjustments. We're going to be wiser. We're going to,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.640]   you know, seek better counsel. And we do everything except humble ourselves
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:23.640]   before God. And as a result of that, more judgment comes. Or, you're very
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.640]   successful at something. Right? And I think that can happen, like, I think it's
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:33.640]   the arrogance of man, which is every time, and this could be true as a church.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   It can be true as an individual. This can be true as a family. If you've
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   succeeded in anything, right, there's always a danger to think that it was you.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   There's always a danger to think that it was you. God says, all you are is an
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   instrument in His hands. Think about whatever you've succeeded in, how much of
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:00.640]   that is based upon you are at the right place at the right time, with the right
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.640]   people. No matter how smart you are, no matter how successful you were as a
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.640]   businessman, if the economy happened to tank, your business is going to tank,
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   too. Right? Anyway, you know what I'm saying, right? I think sometimes success
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   has more damage, has more damaging effect than even when we fail. Right?
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   Because it makes us proud. And once we're proud, God's out. You can say God, you
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.640]   can pray, you can do all these religious things, but in your heart, you don't need
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   God. Right? And that's why when you go to poor countries, like, people are so
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   hung up on prayer. And we can just kind of write that off, oh, it's because they're
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   mystical. You know, they're mystical. We're not mystical. We're Western. We're
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.640]   all about logic and study and all of that. That's not it. It's because they
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:58.640]   recognize, right, they recognize that they can't without God. Because they don't have
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.640]   other stuff to be proud of. So sometimes they see more clearly. But I think, you
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.640]   know, what makes us proud is, the number one thing that makes us proud is money.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   Right? Because money can solve a lot of problems. Money can, you know, get you
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.640]   what you want. Safety, security, friendship, whatever it is. Like, you can
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   get it. So people, that's why Jesus says it's hard for a rich man to enter into
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   the kingdom than camel eye of a needle. Something like that. Right?
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   And again, that's a temptation, is when we're successful. And again, like, when
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   the church is small, you know, we pray to God and say, God, help us. And as soon as
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.640]   it gets big, you're going around telling people, like, this is how you should do
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   church. You know what I mean? Because isn't that part of, partly, like, what
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.640]   makes a church, how is that any different than a small church? I don't know any
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   small church pastor who says, you know, we should pray. You know, it's because we
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.640]   didn't pray like that big church. You know, it's because we didn't think
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   evangelism was important like that big church. That big church really thinks
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   evangelism is important. I don't know any small church that didn't know that.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   Right? So, again, that's a temptation. Church gets big, write a book, what they
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   did, how they preached, how it was organized, and what it is, and say, and you
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.640]   start copying that in Jesus' name. But in the end, it kind of takes us off of what
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   God, what God really wants, is for us to kind of take a step back and say, I'm
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   just an instrument. Right? And you could be an instrument. I mean, look at our
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   church. We do the exact same thing for 18 years. First eight years, no fruit.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:50.640]   Right? As far as humanly you can speak, right, there was no fruit whatsoever.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.640]   You do the exact same thing for the next 10 years, and all of a sudden, people
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.640]   are gathering. So what are we doing right? And what did we do wrong the first eight
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.640]   years? Right? If there's anything, I think what God was doing for the first eight
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   years is to teach one thing. It ain't you. Right? It ain't you. And if God's going to
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   bless anything, He's going to bless something, bless people, bless ministries,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   and bless families. That's not going to touch His glory. Right? If there's
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   anything. Because ultimately, the best place for a church and individual to be
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.640]   is to be humbled and recognize that we're just instruments. Right? I'm just a
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.640]   mouthpiece. Right? And so if God gets the glory, that's where God wants to work.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.640]   That's where the fruit He wants. You know, it doesn't mean it's going to work that
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   way. He may say, oh, I'm going to bear fruit by humbling Him and making Him a
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   Jeremiah. Right? But if we want God to pay attention, we have to get out of the way.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:53.640]   Right? So that's the lesson that we see with Him. How is He going to bring
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.640]   judgment? Very specific. He's going to bring sickness upon them. Right? That all
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.640]   these stout warriors that they have, that they're relying on. Right? And I like the
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   way ESV translated that stout warriors. Like, in my mind, I picture very stocky
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:14.640]   people. Right? Stocky warriors that you have, that you're so proud of, that you
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.640]   think they're strong. God's going to humble all of them. Right? There's actually
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   in chapter 37, 36 to 38, Isaiah actually describes an event, historically took
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   place in 701 BC, where the king of Assyria comes to attack Hezekiah. And
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.640]   overnight, God brings sickness upon them. And over 185,000 of them die. And then
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   they basically, just like Isaiah says here in chapter 10, they have their tail
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.640]   behind their legs. And here's this gigantic superpower that comes and can't
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.640]   conquer this tiny little nation. And Hezekiah, you know, Hezekiah the king, and
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.640]   God humbles them and they come back. So Assyria never is able to completely
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:59.640]   conquer Judah. And it's not because of Hezekiah. It's not because of their army,
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   just like God said. Because God answered their prayers. Right? God was with them.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   Right? What will be the end result of God's use of Assyria? Right? No matter
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   how strong the enemies of Israel may be, may get, it will never completely
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   overthrow God's covenant people. Then that's the final lesson. Right?
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:38.640]   Again, the flip side of that, to the nation of Israel, is however, God will not
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   simply overlook the sins of His people. Even though God is faithful to the
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   nation of Israel, remember we talked about that, that word for, that was
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.640]   translated remnant. Right? One sense it's like God is going to be faithful to the
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.640]   remnant. He's going to return them. But it's also, there's emphasis is only,
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   right? Only a small remnant is going to come. That's one thing again, as I was
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   studying through this last week and this week, what it really reminded me of was
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   when God chooses to work, He always seems to choose a remnant. Right? He doesn't
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.640]   just, you know, we use that term all the time and I think it's misapplied.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:21.640]   We're saying, "Hey, God can use donkeys." Right? God can use donkeys. Yes, God can
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   use donkeys. God can use walls. God can use rocks. But God's not looking for
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   donkeys. Right? God's not looking for donkeys. God can use it, but God calls us
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.640]   to be faithful. Because when revival comes, look at the book of Judges. When
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   revival comes, does it come to the nation? No, He raises up a judge, a judge.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:49.640]   Right? And He answers his or her prayer. And revival comes. Right? And so, same
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   thing with the nation of Israel. When He chooses to restore them, He said He's
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.640]   going to restore them through the remnant. A few. Right? And I think again,
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   what that reminds me of is, we're always looking for movements. You know, revival,
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   movements in our generation, movements in our generation. But the way God typically
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:14.640]   works is remnants. That despite how everybody else responds, that a few who
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.640]   just stubbornly refuse to give in. That I'm not going to go with the flow. I'm
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:25.640]   going to remain faithful to the end. He said those are the people that God uses.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:30.640]   What does the Lord tell His people who live in Zion or Jerusalem? Right? The
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   judgment at the hands of Assyrians will soon pass, so do not fear. Remember we
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   talked about that in the very beginning? Right? Do not fear. Where should your fear
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:45.640]   be? Right? Yes, humanly speaking, it's the Assyrians. Humanly speaking, it's the
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   Babylonians. But never forget that there is a God behind that. Right? That no
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.640]   matter how terrible things get. And again, I think that in our generation, the
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   practical application of that is, you know, my friend who's working in, with
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   the Muslims, he said, "Yeah, the Christians are not coming. The Muslims are
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   dropping out of their faith left and right because of ISIS. As much as they're
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   scaring Christians and people out, the modern Muslims are tired of it and
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   they're stepping out. But there aren't enough churches out there receiving
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   them." So he was basically saying, "We need Christians to step up." And so even in the
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   midst of that, I think a practical application is that there is a, no matter
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   how fearsome and no matter how much terror they try to put in, that in the
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   end, the same thing God's telling these people. Right? It's not the Assyrians that
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   you need to fear. It's interesting that it's coming out of the same area. Right?
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   It's not the Assyrians. It's not Syrians. It's not ISIS that you need to fear.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   It's God behind them. Right? When the king of Assyria made his way near
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   Jerusalem, he said, "They're going to come in arrogance." So all the cities that he
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   mentions, right? You know how he just kind of lists off one city after city?
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   Basically, that's the path to come to Jerusalem. So in other words, these
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   Assyrians and their arrogance are coming and conquering city after city after
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   city. But what does this say? But when they come, right, God's going to stop them at
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   their tracks in verse 32. Right? No matter how many cities they conquer, it's in
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   verse 32, this very day he will halt at Nob. Right? When God says stop, they're
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   going to stop. Because you're not going to touch my people. Right? The only way
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   he's going to allow them to be touched is if God says yes. Right? If God says yes,
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   I have a purpose behind this. But as long as God says these are my people, the
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   Assyrians have no power. So they may have come and marched all their way up to
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.640]   their point, but right before they get to Jerusalem, basically God says you're
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.640]   going to stop right here at Nob. Right? And that's what he's saying. Verse 32,
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   "This very day he will halt at Nob. He will shake his fist at the Mount of
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.640]   Daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem." In other words, in anger, because he
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   couldn't conquer it. Right? That's exactly what happens later on. They come
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.640]   marching all the way to Jerusalem, and they can't get past the wall. Right?
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   "Behold, the Lord God hosts will lop the bows with terrifying power. The great in
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   height will be hewn down, and the lofty will be brought low. He will cut down the
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   thickets of the forest with an axe, and Lebanon will fall by the majestic one."
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   Okay? And so he mentions the majestic ones can come. So the answer isn't another
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   great nation. Right? He says the answer to all of this is the one. Right? The one
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   is coming. That's interesting that he would say here's the Assyrians. I mean,
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   they're probably just as terrifying or more terrifying than when you see these
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.640]   ISIS people are afraid to go to the Middle East and all that. So these guys are
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   actually coming to you by army. We have the US Army to kind of like protect. We
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   have our government and all that. But these Assyrians are coming, and that's
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.640]   exactly what they're beheading people. They're putting their enemies that
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   they've conquered on sticks, and they're making their children watch their
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   parents crucified. That's what the Assyrians did. That's why the people at
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   that time hated the Assyrians, because they were so brutal. Right? And all of
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.640]   that was done to bring terror upon their enemies. So when they come, they would be
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   so frightened they wouldn't even fight. That's what the Assyrians were known for
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   at that time. Right? So he's saying that, no, if they're going to come right up to
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   there, and when God says no, it's going to stop. And the answer to that, he
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   doesn't say, "These mighty angels are going to come from heaven." He says, "No.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   The sign that I'm going to give you, that God's going to deliver you from this, is
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:53.640]   Emmanuel. A child. A child is going to come, and he's going to conquer them."
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   Right? So it's amazing. Like, you know, obviously when you read that, you
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   wouldn't understand, not knowing that he's referring to a literal child. Right?
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   A literal child is going to come, and then he goes through chapter 11, like when he
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   comes. When he comes. He's not talking about an army. He's talking about one
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:15.640]   person. When he comes, all this is going to happen. Chapter 11. Right? So that's
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:22.640]   Christmas. Right? That leads us right to Christmas. Perfect. Predestined.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   Alright, so, as I let you guys go to your small group, we can now send it back to
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.640]   our memory verse for those of you who came a little bit late.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:42.640]   [Typing]
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.640]   Okay. So those of you guys that came late, the memory verse for the next three
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   weeks.
