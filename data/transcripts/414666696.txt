[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   We're continuing our series on the Jesus's seven "I am" statements in the Gospel of John.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.280]   We're on his sixth one, found in John chapter 14, verse 6.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.320]   But I want to read the context around this text, so I'm going to start reading from John
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.720]   chapter 13, verse 33, and then John chapter 14 up to verse 6.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.520]   Starting from verse 33.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.040]   "O children, I am with you a little while longer; you will seek me, and as I said to
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   the Jews, now I also say to you, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.'"
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   Verse 36.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   "Simon Peter said to him, 'Lord, where are you going?'
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.480]   Jesus answered, 'Where I go, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.'
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.680]   Peter said to him, 'Lord, why can I not follow you right now?'"
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   Chapter 14, verse 1.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.480]   "Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in me.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.360]   In my Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.680]   For I go to prepare a place for you.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.280]   If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.080]   where I am, there you may be also.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840]   And you know the way where I am going.'
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.160]   Thomas said to him, 'Lord, we do not know where you are going; how do we know the way?'"
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.280]   And in response to that, Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.960]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.800]   Let's pray and then we'll jump into the message.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.560]   Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning wanting to hear your voice.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.920]   We pray, Father God, that you would give us eagerness to listen, a mind that is open to
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.720]   hear your voice and a will that is willing to surrender.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.640]   I pray that you would ordain this time for the purpose of glorifying your Son and sanctifying
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   your church.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.280]   All right, so again, I forget whether it's six weeks or seven weeks that we've been in
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.400]   quarantine and to be honest, sometimes I wake up and I don't know if it's Monday or Saturday
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   and the only way that I gauge what day it is because of the sermons coming up.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.760]   And so when I have to put on my suit, then I know it's Sunday.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.120]   So I don't know what it's like.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.480]   I know many of you guys are still going to work, but I think I ask my kids, "What's the
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.160]   first thing that you want to do once quarantine lifts?"
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.280]   And obviously, they want to get together with their friends, maybe go out to eat, maybe
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.120]   hang out, whatever that may be.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.680]   And I thought once this thing completely opens up, obviously the first thing that I look
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.240]   forward to is to see the whole church back at church, to be able to have worship together,
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.320]   to sing together, maybe go to a nice restaurant and actually sit down and eat a meal instead
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.080]   of just taking it out or just eating at home.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.440]   Some of you guys have mentioned that your first thing that you want to do is to run
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   to Disneyland.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.160]   I don't understand you, but I know some of you guys are looking forward to some of these
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.480]   things.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.240]   I want to ask you a bigger question than that.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.040]   Once we pass through this temporary life, and when we think of heaven, what is it that
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.280]   you look forward to the most?
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:36.160]   What is heaven that you imagine that causes you to think that, "I can't wait to get there"?
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.200]   The statement that Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.480]   No one comes to the Father but through me," he says that in the context of him promising
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.840]   them that he's going to the Father's house to prepare a place for them.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.000]   In other words, he's talking about heaven.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.560]   He says to them, "Where I am going, you cannot come."
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.240]   They were very disturbed.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.080]   In chapter 14, verse 1, it says, "Do not let your hearts be troubled," because they were
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   asking, "Why can't we go with you?"
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.280]   This sixth statement, and we have one more statement of Jesus, "I am divine," before
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.120]   he leaves, but these last two statements are specifically directed toward his disciples
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.760]   to prepare them for his leaving.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.680]   He says that to actually give them comfort, because he has been making it clear that he's
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680]   leaving.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.260]   He's leaving, and so it's starting to dawn on him, "This doesn't make any sense.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.600]   You told us to follow you.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.200]   Now you're telling us that you're going to leave, and we can't follow you."
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.640]   In response to that, Jesus says, "Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.540]   Where I am going, I need to go in order to prepare a place for you in my Father's house.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.720]   When it is the right time, you will be able to come.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.520]   Right now you can't come, but at the right time, you're going to be able to follow me."
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.720]   Then Thomas responds, "No, we do not know where you are going.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.800]   How do we know the way?"
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.880]   It is in response to this distressful question that Jesus responds and says, "I am the way.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.200]   I am the truth, and I am the life, and no one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.960]   Even before we get into understanding what he is saying here, we need to understand the
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.040]   emphatic nature of this statement, because we know that all of the "I am" statements,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.600]   even if Jesus said nothing else other than to say, "I am, I am, I am, I am," we know
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.720]   that he was basically saying he is God.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.400]   Even if he said nothing other than "I am."
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.880]   So the "I am" statement alone, without what comes after, stands by itself, and that in
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.800]   and of itself would have been shocking.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.240]   How can you be "I am," because clearly he was pointing to the fact that the way God
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.320]   of the Old Testament in Exodus introduced himself and Jesus saying, "I am."
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.280]   Not "I was," not "I will be," but "I am."
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   It is an emphatic statement on its own.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.640]   But along with that, he says, "I am the truth.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   I am the way.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.160]   I am the life."
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.280]   And this article "the" in front of it is something that we need to pay attention to, because
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.440]   he wasn't saying that he is a way.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   He's the best way.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.760]   He says, "No, I am the way."
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.920]   So maybe a better way for us to understand it is him saying, "I am the only way.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.240]   I am the only truth.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.480]   I am the only life."
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.240]   And so obviously he's saying all of this is because he is preparing a way for them.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.020]   And when he's talking about where he's going, he's talking about heaven.
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.800]   So if you connect these two things together, what Jesus basically is saying, "I am the
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.120]   only way to heaven.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.240]   I am the only truth to heaven.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.800]   I am the only life that leads you to heaven.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.720]   There is no other way."
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.480]   And so with that, we want to look at these three statements.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.680]   And if you have the children's outline, some of you parents, under each one of these statements,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.680]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life," I divided it into two parts under each title,
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.080]   because Jesus says this to, first of all, give them comfort, because they were very
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.020]   distressed.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.000]   And then secondly, he's saying this to them to prepare them for what's coming, the trials
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.420]   that are coming.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.080]   So one is to comfort them, and second is to equip them.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.280]   And I think every truth that we learn in scripture really falls into those two categories.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.720]   Every truth that we have, it first causes us to be comforted.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.480]   When we hear about God's sovereignty, his nature of who he is, his sovereignty gives
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.680]   us comfort because we know that he is completely in control.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.200]   That even in this pandemic, he didn't lose control.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.400]   Even with all the famine and with all the distress that we see around the world, God
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.840]   hasn't lost control.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.060]   But at the same time, he is equipping us to recognize in order for us to be the true light
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.540]   in the world, we need to recognize that he is sovereign, not us.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.420]   So it equips us to strengthen us for the work that he has given us to do to be the light.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.000]   So we're going to look at each one of these things in these two categories.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.700]   And the first one is, Jesus says to comfort them, "I am the way.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.980]   I am the only way."
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.660]   You can imagine how the disciples must have felt when they left everything to follow Christ.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:25.340]   Remember, in the first "I am" statement, "I am the bread of life," Jesus says, "If you
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.620]   do not eat of my flesh and drink of my blood, you cannot be my disciples."
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.700]   And in John chapter 6, 66, all of the disciples begin to turn away from him.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.300]   All those people who ate the miraculous feeding of the fish and the bread, they turn away
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.300]   and they leave him.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.060]   And Jesus turns around and says, "Are you going to leave too?"
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.980]   He says, "No, we can't leave you.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.260]   We left everything to follow you."
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:56.700]   Well, they've been following him with threats of death, beating, isolation, hunger, and
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.060]   even with a deadly storm that came upon them.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.760]   But as long as they were with Jesus, they felt safe.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.940]   But now Jesus is saying, after he told them clearly, "One of you are going to betray me,"
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.900]   and then prior to that, he's been repeatedly saying to them that, "I'm going to be caught.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.300]   I'm going to be crucified.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.260]   I'm going to die.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.260]   And though I will resurrect on the third day," he told them clearly what was coming.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.940]   But right before the most difficult part of his ministry is about to happen, Jesus says,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.940]   "I'm leaving."
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.940]   Right?
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.620]   They don't fully understand what's going on.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.820]   "We left everything to follow you.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.540]   What do you mean that we cannot follow you?"
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.500]   Well, he is saying this, again, not to say, "I'm going to go hide and seek and see if
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.860]   you can come and find me."
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:51.260]   In Joshua chapter 1, 9, as he was commanding, as God was commanding Joshua to go conquer
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:58.620]   this new land, fortified, right, with a bunch of soldiers who were wandering in the desert
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.700]   for 40 years.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.700]   And they're not trained soldiers.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.820]   They don't have the proper equipment.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.580]   They have their family and their children tagging along with them.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.860]   How are they going to conquer this great land?
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.500]   So if anybody was in distress, you can imagine the distress that Joshua was in, and God promises
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.220]   him this, "Have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:26.500]   Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go."
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.980]   In other words, God's promise to Joshua was, "Do not worry.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.700]   I am with you.
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.700]   I am with you."
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.780]   Just like Jesus was in the storm with the disciples, and as they were afraid for their
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.900]   life, and Jesus said, "You of little faith, do you not believe who I am?"
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.580]   And in essence, Jesus was comforting them in the same way.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.220]   Even though I am going, I am not leaving you, right?
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.260]   In fact, later on, we won't be going through this today, but he says, "I'm not going to
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.260]   leave you.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.860]   I'm going to be sending a comforter, and he's going to guide you.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.060]   He's going to remind you of everything that I've said."
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.900]   So the first statement, "I am the way," is Jesus comforting them and reminding them,
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.900]   "I'm not leaving you."
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.420]   Matthew 28, 19-20.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:18.860]   As he gives the Great Commission, we have a tendency to focus on, "Go therefore, make
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.460]   disciples, baptizing them, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:30.360]   But the essence of the Great Commandment isn't the instruction of going, baptizing, and teaching.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.520]   Even though those are the specific things that he has called them to do, he says, "I
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.600]   am with you," at the end of verse 20, "even to the end of the age."
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.080]   So any of you who've ever studied that passage, you know that he begins by saying, "All authority
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.320]   in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.760]   Therefore go and make disciples."
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:57.960]   And then he concludes it by saying, "Don't worry, I am going with you."
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:05.120]   So the first reason why he makes this statement to us and to the disciples is to give us comfort.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.440]   That he didn't just leave us and say, "Hey, I hope you guys can make it.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.880]   It's going to be a long journey.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.960]   There's going to be a lot of trials, persecutions, hardship, famine, pestilence.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.400]   May come your way, but I hope you guys can make it."
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.640]   He was reminding them that he will never leave us or forsake us.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.520]   The path that we are to take, he's not just pointing us to the path.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.760]   He says, "No, I am the path."
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.640]   Years ago, I was in Knoxville, not Nashville, but Knoxville.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.760]   Nashville is where all the city is and big buildings, and that's where they have the
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.440]   SING conference, but I was in Knoxville to take care of some business.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.440]   What business that is, I don't have time to explain right now.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.040]   But I was in Knoxville and I had to meet some people and I had to do some stuff.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.000]   And after I took care of my business, I was on the way back to my hotel.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.960]   This is before GPS.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.400]   And I got lost.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.800]   And anybody who's been in Knoxville, it's like Big Bear without the houses, basically.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   And you have one building maybe every two, three miles.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.400]   And I got lost.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.040]   And it was 2, 3 in the morning and I just couldn't find out.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.000]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, am I getting deeper into the woods and we're running out of gas?"
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   No GPS.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.880]   And back then, we didn't have...
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.080]   I don't remember.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.280]   I don't think I had cell phones at that time.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.880]   So I remember just being anxious, being in the middle of nowhere.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.760]   And I remember seeing a light from way off in the distance, Walmart.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.920]   Here Walmart is not 24/7, but over there, Walmart is everything.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.160]   Like if you want to get your car fixed, you go to Walmart.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.840]   You want to buy meat, you go to Walmart.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.120]   Computer, you go to Walmart.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.120]   So Walmart was everything.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.920]   So as soon as I saw Walmart, I went and I asked.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920]   They were very friendly.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   They told me how to get back home to the hotel.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.560]   And I remember being so relieved.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.640]   Some of you guys may remember before we had GPS, being lost on the road.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.120]   Let's say if you're going to your friend's house that you've never been to, and then
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.760]   you got lost, the only way that we can find a pullover, find a phone, make sure you have
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.440]   enough change, put it in there.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.200]   Hopefully he's by the phone so you can pick it up and then he gives you the instruction.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.900]   Hopefully you have pen and paper, you can write it down.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.980]   And then you go and then if that doesn't work, you got to pull over again and ask somebody.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.660]   That's what life used to be like.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.120]   Imagine if we were going to a friend's house and we got lost in a place like Knoxville
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:35.200]   and you're distressed, you're running out of gas, middle of the night, and there is
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.040]   no Walmart.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:44.100]   Then all of a sudden you see your friend standing by the side of the road.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:49.560]   And the moment that you see your friend, your anxiousness is gone.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.660]   You're no longer lost, even though you have no idea where you're at.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.660]   You're no longer lost.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.320]   Because you're going to your friend's house and your friend is on the road.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.480]   So as soon as he gets in the car, you're not looking anymore.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.520]   You don't need the GPS.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.080]   There is no time crunch.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.680]   You don't have to worry about which road.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.060]   He tells you to make a left, you make a left.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.740]   He tells you to make a right, you make a right.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.480]   And even if you end up going nowhere, you're already there.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.120]   Because you're going to see your friend and your friend is already in the car.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.200]   I'm saying this as an illustration because that's exactly what Jesus is saying to his
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.000]   disciples.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.520]   You're worried about getting to heaven.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.020]   He says, "I am the way.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:37.980]   If you are with me, if you are with me, you don't need to strive.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.300]   You don't need to be lost."
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:48.840]   All that feeling of anxiousness, time crunch, purposefulness, instantaneously is answered
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.080]   when Christ is in your car.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.040]   See, that's what he was saying.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.900]   The first and most important part of the statement, "I am the way," is reminding his disciples,
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.820]   even though I will physically be gone, I will not leave you.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.820]   I am with you.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.760]   I am the way.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.240]   But the second part of this is to prepare them for what was coming.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.520]   John 13, this is a passage that we read in the beginning.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.800]   It says, "Simon Peter said to him, 'Lord, where are you going?'
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.500]   Jesus answered, 'Where I go, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.'"
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.620]   Peter, he's the outspoken one.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.260]   He's the guy that is like, "No."
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.300]   He's the guy with the extra testosterone.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.860]   He's not going to be like these other guys.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.520]   Like I will die for you.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.580]   What do you mean we can't follow you?
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.460]   I will follow you.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.260]   I got my knife.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.820]   I will follow you.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.940]   Lord, why can't I follow you?
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.460]   I will lay down my life for you.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.200]   And I don't think Peter was just talking.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.460]   I think Peter really meant it.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.540]   And the reason why I say that is because when the soldiers came to get Jesus at the Garden
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:57.580]   of Gethsemane, Peter actually took out the sword, and he actually swung it, even though
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.420]   he actually missed it.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.500]   Obviously, he was a fisherman.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.580]   He was not a soldier.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.540]   But the fact that he was willing to do that, and even though they probably were outnumbered,
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:13.940]   maybe 100 to 1, at least that's what the records say, probably they were outnumbered, at least
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.220]   100 to 1.
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.980]   Peter meant it.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:25.060]   Even though he meant it, he didn't know himself as well as Jesus did.
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.540]   Jesus had answered, "Will you lay down your life for me?"
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.340]   In other words, you will not.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:37.140]   "Truly, truly, I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny me three times."
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:43.500]   So again, remember, he's saying this in the context of him reminding them, "I am the way.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.140]   I am the truth."
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.380]   In other words, he's telling Peter, "Peter, I'm going.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.020]   You're not going to be able to follow me.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.060]   You are not going to be able to follow me."
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:18:03.060]   In other words, no matter how determined you are, your loyalty, your desire to do good,
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:08.580]   your talent, your ability, your experiences, you will not be able to follow him.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.580]   Remember what Jesus said?
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.580]   "Where are you going?"
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.620]   "I am going to my Father's house, to heaven, to prepare a place for you."
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.620]   No.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.700]   Is heaven not ready?
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.580]   When Jesus came down, did he just lay the foundation?
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.580]   He's going back.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.700]   He's like, "I got to prepare the room."
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.180]   And Jesus has a hammer and nails, and he's preparing a room.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.780]   For the last 2,000 years, he's been working at it.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:37.260]   And when the rooms are ready, right, a million rooms, maybe that's why it's taking 2,000
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.260]   years, right?
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.580]   There's a lot of rooms.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.860]   What does he mean by he's preparing a room for them?
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.020]   He's not preparing heaven for the people.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.500]   He's preparing people for heaven.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.620]   Let me say that again.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.300]   He's not preparing rooms because they're undone.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.860]   He didn't leave heaven incomplete.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.180]   He came down here to prepare us for heaven.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.500]   And what he was telling Peter was, "Peter, you cannot follow me.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.140]   That's why I go to prepare."
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.100]   He's talking about the cross.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:18.260]   And the first thing that Peter needed to learn was that way is not you.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.420]   It's not your determination.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.920]   It's not your ability.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   It's not your loyalty.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.820]   It's not even your love for me.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.700]   I go to prepare a way for you.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.460]   So he was preparing the disciples for what is coming.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.180]   He's going to go to the cross, and they may not fully understand at this point, but once
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:41.220]   he dies and he resurrects, that they will remember that Jesus is the way.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.300]   That's why it says in Luke 9.23, "And he was saying to them, 'Oh, if anyone wishes to come
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:51.620]   after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.'"
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.380]   We live our whole lives trying to find ourselves.
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.380]   Am I an introvert?
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.380]   Am I an extrovert?
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.380]   Do I like this?
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.380]   Do I like that?
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.380]   What kind of gift?
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.380]   What's my gift?
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.420]   That's one of the, even as Christians, we're always looking for, "What's my gift?"
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.420]   And in a way, we're all trying to find ourselves.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.060]   Like, "Who am I so that I can live and I can have a purpose?
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.920]   I can do this and I can do that?"
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:22.500]   But the primary thing that the Bible tells us is to lose ourselves, to die to ourselves.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.500]   As Peter is saying, "No, I'm going to lay down my life."
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.660]   He's like, "Will you truly do that, Peter?
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.820]   Will you truly do that?
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.820]   Will you truly serve me?
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.820]   Will you truly sacrifice?
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.380]   Do you really think you can do that?"
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.940]   So the first thing that they need to be comforted by and also reminded by, it is not you.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.940]   I am the only way.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.140]   Christ is the only way.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:53.540]   Now, if you're out there listening and you're not a Christian, you don't believe this, I
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:21:01.260]   mean, that's an arrogant thing to say, especially in this pluralistic postmodern culture, for
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.580]   you to stand there and say, and not just me, anybody who's teaching the Bible will say
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.580]   the same thing.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.140]   He is not just saying, "He's a good way."
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.300]   He says, "I am the only way."
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:17.420]   In fact, we have more and more people, even people who claim to be Christians, saying
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.340]   that it's arrogant for us to say, "He's the only way."
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.820]   You can say, "He's a good way."
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.340]   Maybe you can even say, "He's the best way."
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.020]   That's an arrogant thing to say, but maybe you can even say that.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.820]   But to say, "He's the only way," it sounds arrogant.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:40.460]   In fact, it seems a lot more humble and gracious to say that, "He is my way," but maybe not
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.580]   your way.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:49.700]   And the reason why there's less and less people who are able to say this emphatically is because
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.700]   they themselves are not sure.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:59.600]   Either they have weak faith or they have no faith, because you never run into a burning
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.020]   building and say, "Hey, I have three options for you."
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:10.060]   You could believe that it's burning, and you could believe that you can believe you can
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.620]   go through this door and you'll save your life, but I'm not going to judge you.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.300]   That sounds kind of arrogant.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:22.580]   Depending on the message, the message has to be crystal clear, and Jesus made that crystal
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.580]   clear.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.740]   And the reason why he says that is not arrogant.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.500]   It's because it's true.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:35.340]   He's telling people who are under the condemnation of God, and the only way to heaven is through
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.860]   Christ.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.860]   That's what he was saying.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.300]   "I am the way, the only way."
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.980]   And the disciples needed to know that because every stage of their ministry, they will be
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.100]   challenged by the pagan world that they're going to evangelize.
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:55.700]   Every city that they go to, "How dare you say Jesus is the only way?"
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.860]   We have thousands of other idols, and you're saying of all the thousands of idols, you
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:07.460]   this puny little nation of Israel, that your Messiah supersedes Caesar?
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.620]   Of all the other gods that we've been worshiping, you're saying all of that is nullified and
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.840]   only Jesus is the only way?
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.860]   That's exactly what Jesus was saying.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:22.500]   So he was not only comforting them, he was preparing them for what was to come.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.540]   Secondly, and again, the most important point was the first one, but the second, he said
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.300]   Jesus is the truth.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.860]   Not only is he the only way, he's the only truth.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.700]   He comforts them in John 14, 18.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.780]   "I will not leave you as orphans.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.300]   I will come to you."
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.420]   And then he promises them the Holy Spirit, and the primary work of the Holy Spirit is
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.260]   not feeling, is not louder worship.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.660]   He said the primary reason why the comforter is going to come to you is that he's going
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.660]   to remind you of everything that I have taught you.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.380]   That's what he says.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.420]   The primary duty of the Holy Spirit is to convict the world of sin and to remind the
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:07.020]   Christians continually of the truth of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.980]   He says, "I am the truth."
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:15.260]   Again in John 6, 66, when Jesus turns to his disciples, when all the other were leaving,
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.380]   are you going to leave too?
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:23.980]   As a result of this, many of his disciples withdrew and were not walking with him anymore.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.860]   So Jesus said to the 12, "You do not want to go away also, do you?"
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.220]   Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.660]   You have the words of eternal life."
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.340]   You have the words of eternal life.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.140]   I may not fully understand you, and you've just said some crazy stuff about eating your
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.720]   flesh and drinking your blood, so I don't really fully get what you're doing.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.580]   You say you're going to the cross and be crucified.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.700]   Why would you do that?
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.700]   You're the Messiah.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.760]   Who's going to sit to the left or to the right?
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.260]   That's what the disciples were concerned about.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.380]   That's what they were debating and fighting over.
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:04.800]   I don't fully understand what you're doing, but we believe you.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.000]   You have the words of truth.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.060]   In 1 Timothy 2, 5-6, "For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:19.000]   one Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.960]   time."
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.760]   There's only one mediator.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.460]   There's only one path.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.140]   There's only one truth.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:35.280]   You know, that ought to bring tremendous comfort for all of us because the truth doesn't change.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.700]   But it also equips us to be able to live in this relativistic society.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.980]   You know, more and more you hear people saying, "There is no absolute truth.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.980]   It's only relative truth."
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.100]   Relative truth, that statement alone is an oxymoron.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.720]   Relative truth.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.760]   Like jumbo shrimp.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.100]   These are oxymorons.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.340]   Those two words really don't go together.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.500]   Either it's truth or it is relative.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.860]   By nature, truth does not change.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.980]   When you say that that's truth, it does not change.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.500]   Truth by nature is inflexible.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:20.340]   If you say it's truth, but it's flexible, it's no longer truth.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.600]   It's opinion.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.660]   It's maybe your thought.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.380]   It could be a philosophy, but it's not truth.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:31.220]   The term truth by the nature of the word is inflexible.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.580]   It does not change based on culture.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.940]   Like, "Oh, that truth was good in the poor areas.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.560]   That truth was good 2,000 years when they didn't know all of this other stuff, all these
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.380]   other facts, but now it's no longer true today."
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.580]   If it was truth then, it has to be true now.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.100]   That's the nature of the word truth.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.700]   Truth does not change based on generation.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.980]   You know, you teach the gospel this way to the old people, but to the new generation
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:04.220]   who's computerized, and you know, the gospel needs to change for them.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.400]   They're not going to accept this.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.140]   By nature, if we say it's truth, truth does not change.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.140]   It is inflexible.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.940]   It's not based on preference.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.940]   Truth is truth.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.780]   You know, one plus one equals two.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:26.220]   It's not two for two-year-olds and three for five-year-olds and then 10 for 30-year-olds.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:32.900]   One plus one used to be two 10, 20 years ago, but 50 years from now, it's going to be four.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.980]   No, then it's not fact.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.200]   It's not truth.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.400]   By nature, truth is inflexible.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.820]   It does not change by preference, by culture, by generation, by age.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.480]   Therefore, truth is never new.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.920]   Because truth is inflexible, it has been true all along.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:59.420]   Truth, because it is inflexible, is the foundation upon anything that we build.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:05.700]   You don't build a building that you want to last on sand.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.860]   Because the sand always changes.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.660]   It shifts.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.300]   One day, one part of sand will be there, and then when the waves come at night, there's
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.160]   a different part of sand there.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.240]   And then when the waves come in, a different part of sand there.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.840]   And when it's wet, it feels different.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.100]   When it's dry, it feels different.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.620]   So the sand is always shifting, always changing.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:30.740]   That's why the Bible tells us not to build our house upon sand.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.560]   Because sand always changes.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.300]   But the truth, whenever we build something, what do we build it on?
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.740]   We build on something that does not move.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.300]   That's why we pour concrete.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.920]   Because we don't want it moving.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.840]   Even if everything around it moves, we don't want the foundation to be moving.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.620]   That's why Jesus is called the cornerstone.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.140]   That's what he means when he says, "I am the truth."
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:29:00.340]   We don't anchor our boat, if we don't want it to move, we don't anchor it on something
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.820]   that is also moving.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.780]   Because then you're not anchored.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:09.080]   To be anchored in something means you are hooking your boat onto something that's going
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.740]   to remain the same no matter what happens.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.060]   Whether it's a big wave or a small wave.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.620]   Whether it's calm waters, that you're going to sit there two, three hours later, four,
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.360]   five days later, you're going to be in the exact same place.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.780]   That's why the whole book of Hebrews is to be anchored in Christ.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:31.300]   And if Christ is not the truth, we can't anchor with him.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.060]   Because we don't know where that's going to take us a year from now or ten years from
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.260]   now or whether we're young, whether we're married, or whether we're old, or whether
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.120]   we're retired.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:45.980]   That's what he means when he says that we are anchored in Christ, that he is the truth.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.520]   And he is preparing them.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.180]   He's preparing them because they will be challenged over and over again.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:59.020]   Remember what Paul says in Corinthians, chapter 122 to 24, "For indeed, Jews ask for signs,
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.660]   Greeks search for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.700]   To Jews, a stumbling block and Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.380]   Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.100]   You know why Paul was saying this?
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:18.180]   Is because there was constant, constant complaint.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.460]   Paul.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.780]   Maybe if we went to this next city, right?
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.340]   You know, we went to Philippi and we got beaten up and thrown into jail.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.180]   So maybe next time we go to Athens, maybe we try a different method, right?
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.660]   Because they want some power.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.500]   I mean, Paul, you're an apostle.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.940]   I mean, you can raise people from the dead.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.940]   You can, you know, like open their eyes.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.980]   Wisdom, man, your disciple was Gamaliel.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:54.380]   I mean, you're one of the most educated person in Israel and you are the most powerful.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.140]   So my guess is there was constant temptation to say, you know what?
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.900]   Man, I'm so tired of getting beaten up in the cities.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.500]   You know, and sometimes it seems like there's a lot of fruit and sometimes they're still
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.300]   like nobody cares.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.820]   Let's try something else.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.860]   Jews ask for signs, right?
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.820]   Although it was the other way, right?
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.540]   Jews ask for wisdom, right?
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.900]   And the Gentiles look for power, signs.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.340]   But he said, no, we preach Christ crucified.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.460]   What seems foolishness to you, it is the power of God unto salvation.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.460]   And that's what Jesus meant.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.940]   I go to prepare a way for you.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.500]   These signs and wonders may tickle their ears and may be sensational for a period, but it
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.360]   has no power to save you.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.420]   The only way that we can be prepared to go to heaven is Christ crucified.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:51.860]   That's why Paul says, though they want signs, though they want wisdom, we preach Christ
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.860]   crucified.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.380]   Third and finally, Jesus is the life.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.820]   Again, to comfort them in John 14, 19, he says, after a little while, the world will
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.940]   no longer see me, but you will see me because I live, you will live also.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:12.260]   Now, obviously the disciples didn't clearly understand what he was saying because after
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:16.460]   Jesus resurrects, they don't even go to the tomb.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:21.700]   Because as long as he lives, I mean, Jesus says some crazy stuff.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.700]   Walks on water.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.480]   Oh, we don't have bread.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.920]   Just give it to them, right?
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.100]   We don't have money to pay taxes.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.580]   You know, open that fish's mouth and there's some gold in there.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.580]   I mean, he does some crazy stuff.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:40.380]   So even though we don't get him, as long as he is living, as long as he is with us, we
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.700]   have hope.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:48.420]   But after Jesus dies, even though he made it very clear, resurrection wasn't part of
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.420]   their paradigm.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.660]   Because miracles they can see because they've seen it.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:33:00.380]   Walking on water, calming the storm, paying bills out of fish's mouth, feeding thousands
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.500]   of hungry people, that's within their paradigm.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:10.300]   I mean, their paradigm got stretched by watching and walking with Jesus, but death is final.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:14.140]   So even though Jesus made it very clear he's going to resurrect on the third day, they
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.380]   lost hope when he died.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.060]   And they were distressed.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.260]   They were confused.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.660]   And they were in fear.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.580]   If they can kill him, clearly they can kill us.
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.780]   We left everything to follow Jesus.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:38.220]   You know, whether it's the disciples or it's us, we follow Jesus because we think it's
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.820]   a good investment.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.260]   Nobody follows Jesus and says, "You know what?
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.740]   I'm going to be crucified, and for eternity I'm going to be crucified."
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.740]   Nobody.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.940]   We pick up our cross and follow him because following him means there's glory on the other
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   side.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.260]   The disciples left everything to follow Jesus because he's the Messiah, because they thought
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.660]   at some point, if they put in their time, if they keep with him, that they're going
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.460]   to also see glory.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.740]   And they weren't wrong, because Jesus did say that.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.220]   He did say glory was coming.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:18.100]   But what he did say was glory was going to come through the cross.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.860]   That's why they were distressed.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.340]   We followed you because we thought at the end of this road there was going to be better
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.340]   life.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.380]   But if you go to the cross, what does that mean?
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.220]   If you die, what hope is there?
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.900]   So Jesus is comforting them.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.420]   I am the way.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.620]   I am the truth.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.820]   I am the life.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.020]   There is no other path.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.460]   If you go another path, there is no path of life by being a great fisherman.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.140]   There's no path of life by becoming a Sanhedrin.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.860]   No amount of wealth is going to get you into the kingdom.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:01.460]   John 4, 13 to 14, "Jesus answered and said to her, the woman at the well, 'Everyone who
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.340]   drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.920]   him shall never thirst.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.920]   But the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water, springing up to eternal
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   life.'"
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.780]   And he's comforting them.
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.620]   Yes, I'm going to prepare a way for you.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.400]   Yes, I will die.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.100]   But I will resurrect.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.220]   And you will also die.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.140]   But you will also resurrect.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:33.820]   He was preparing them for the hardship that's coming.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.020]   Even in death, you will live.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.060]   John 11, 25 to 26, "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.460]   He who believes in me will live even if he dies.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.620]   And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.900]   Do you believe this?'"
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.660]   This is the crux of the matter right here.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.180]   Everything that you've heard about Christianity really can be summed up by this statement
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.780]   and this challenge.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.260]   That even if you die, you will live.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.660]   Do you believe this?
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.580]   It's like, "Well, I believe Jesus is a great guy.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.980]   I believe Jesus is going to prepare a way for heaven.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.820]   I believe he answers my prayer.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.140]   He loves me unconditionally.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.140]   I trust him."
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:21.860]   You can say all of these stuff and all of these things are true, but all of that is
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:30.200]   founded upon this statement, "Even if you die, you will live.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.840]   Do you believe this?"
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:40.860]   Because if we don't believe this, we will see Jesus as an avenue, as a means, that if
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.700]   we follow him, maybe he'll answer our prayers, maybe he'll make us great, maybe he'll keep
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:50.660]   our children safe, and maybe he'll bless our business, and he'll pay our bills, and that
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:55.980]   we can have a nice, peaceful, long life, raise good children in a nice place, because that's
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.980]   how we'll see Jesus.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.060]   But that was not his invitation.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:09.100]   He said to pick up your cross and follow me, because even if you die, you will live.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.460]   Do you believe this?
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:17.660]   So all the other things that we obey Christ is founded upon this truth, "Do I believe
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.980]   this?"
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:26.380]   Because if I believe this, and I no longer fear death, it frees me to be able to live
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.500]   the life that Christ wants me to live.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:37.180]   But as long as I am afraid to die, we will always be bound by this fear.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.300]   Our obedience will always have a limit to where we will go.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:48.300]   Our life will always be limited by the boundaries that are set because of this fear.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.980]   If you believe me, even if you die, you will live.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.260]   Do you believe this?
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:02.300]   Let me conclude with this, and I'm going to skip two verses and get to Colossians 3, 4.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:08.780]   It says, "When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.540]   him in glory."
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.340]   There's a couple of things that we need to recognize here.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.420]   First of all, that Christ is our life.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.100]   He says, "Christ, who is your life?
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.060]   Is he our life?
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.980]   Is he a part of our life?
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.220]   Is he a source of life?
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.500]   Or is he our life?
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.860]   Do we live because we're with him?
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.660]   Is he the one that we pursue?
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.660]   Is he the way?
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.700]   Is he the truth?
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.700]   Is he our life?"
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:41.300]   But along with that, what the statement says is, "Christ, who is our life, when he is revealed,
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.700]   you also be revealed with him in glory."
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.500]   In other words, he's saying, "This is not your life."
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:52.060]   So your pursuit of this world, pursuit of recognition, pursuit of comfort, pursuit of
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:57.860]   safety, pursuit of retirement, pursuit of whatever it is that we're looking for, he
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.900]   said, "No, that is not your life.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:06.500]   When Christ, who is your life, when he appears, glory is coming."
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:12.740]   And that's what makes us Christian, because life is not here.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:18.700]   Whether we are quarantined for the rest of our lives, or whether we come out and flourish
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.780]   and have the freedom to do whatever we want, Paul says, "I have learned the secret of being
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.220]   content in every and all situation."
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.420]   Whether he has plenty, whether he has little.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.060]   Whether he's sitting in prison or whether he's free to do whatever he wants, he's learned
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.060]   the secret of being content.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:42.820]   And that secret of being content is Christ being his life.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.700]   Because his life doesn't come with safety, his life doesn't come with health, his life
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:51.020]   isn't connected to whether he's in a prison or whether he's outside a prison.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.900]   His life is Christ.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:58.260]   And no matter what circumstance he's in, they can't take that away from him.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.660]   What can separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.180]   Is Christ our life?
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:12.900]   The disciples needed to not only be comforted by this, they needed to be equipped with this.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:21.940]   Because God was, Jesus was going to send them into very difficult situation.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.660]   And all of them are going to be killed with the exception of one.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.860]   And even the one that wasn't killed, it would have been easy for him if he just ended his
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.820]   life, if you know what happened to Apostle John.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:37.620]   Every single one of them, not only did they understand this, but they believed it with
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.060]   all their heart.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:44.260]   And they were willing to give their life that other people may have this as well.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:48.420]   So this sixth statement, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.260]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.460]   And let me encourage you this morning with this.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.260]   I want to, I'm not asking you to sing this song.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.740]   So if you know, you can sing it.
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:03.060]   But the next, I have a video that I want you to watch and sing along internally.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:09.460]   But if you look at the song, there's six separate circumstances that people are in.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.580]   And the conclusion of each of this is Christ.
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.580]   Weak and wounded sinner, lost and left to die.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.940]   Oh, raise your head for love is passing by.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.460]   Come to Jesus, come to Jesus.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.820]   Come to Jesus and live.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:29.220]   Now your burden's lifted and carried far away and precious blood has washed away the
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.140]   stain.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.300]   Sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus, sing to Jesus and live.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:41.100]   And like newborn baby, don't be afraid to crawl and remember when you walk, sometimes
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.420]   we fall.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:50.420]   So fall on Jesus, fall on Jesus, fall on Jesus and live.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:56.900]   Sometimes the way is lonely and steep and filled with pain.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:06.540]   So if your sky is dark and pours the rain, then cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus, cry to Jesus
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.540]   and live.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.340]   Oh, when the love spills over and music fills the night and when you can't contain your
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:16.500]   joy inside, then dance for Jesus.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.660]   Dance for Jesus, dance for Jesus and live.
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:25.940]   And then finally at the end of our lives and with your final heartbeat, kiss the world
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.940]   goodbye.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:36.220]   Then go in peace and laugh on glory side and fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus, fly to Jesus and
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.220]   live.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.500]   I pray that this song will minister to you.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.420]   And as you listen, and hopefully it would be your prayer.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.540]   I'm just going to ask you to listen to that and then our worship team is going to lead
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.980]   us in our final praise afterwards.
