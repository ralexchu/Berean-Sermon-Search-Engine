[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.320]   But first, we just want to say that we're just so honored that we're able to share our
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.440]   experiences from India and also represent the Eye Care team.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.800]   This is the first year that we've gone and the fourth year that Burian has sent a team
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800]   to India.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.560]   And personally, Vince and I decided to go because we wanted to serve God using our Eye
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.240]   Care skills so that hopefully we could be useful to the team.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.960]   And I'll be a little bit honest, there's a little bit of pride involved because this
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.360]   year there were five Eye Care professionals going.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.400]   And because of that, I was just really ready to rock it with this rock star team.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.680]   But as we were preparing for the trip, and especially during the trip, there was definitely
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.400]   a turning point where my mind shifted in what our goals were trying to achieve.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.520]   Because it no longer was really about seeing as many patients as possible, but more in
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.480]   utilizing the Eye Care to reach the many lost souls.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.640]   And I learned that with the medical care that we provided there, along with VBS and wound
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.160]   care, that this would then serve as an avenue for the Indian pastors to share the gospel
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.600]   in an otherwise hostile environment.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.440]   On a regular basis, these pastors who are there, they live there and they would travel
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.720]   to these villages that are sometimes one or two hours away and try to spread the gospel,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.840]   not knowing whether or not they would receive the word at all.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.080]   And sometimes they would get rejected or they would get beat or chased away.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.720]   And then, so with our presence there providing the medical care, they were offered an in.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.560]   They were offered an opportunity to be able to share that gospel.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.320]   So by providing this medical care, the villagers were then intrigued, they were curious, they
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.560]   would ask, "Why would these people who live in the comfortable U.S. come all the way here
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   to help us?"
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:38.480]   And the pastors would be very, they would definitely mention this fact when they would
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.800]   talk about us and introduce us in the ceremony.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.840]   And the pastors would then indicate the reason why they're here.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.680]   They would leave their comfortable homes because they're here to share the word of God.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.520]   They're here because they love God and they desire for you to know him too, because he's
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.880]   worthy and because he's our one true Lord of all things.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.320]   So on the eight days that we were gone, we actually spent only four of the days visiting
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   four different villages.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.320]   Every day it took about one to two hours to travel every day.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.400]   And by the way, I just have to say the driving in India is just absolute madness.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.640]   There's no organization.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.100]   Literally if there were two lanes, one going and one incoming, the cars would just go over
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.720]   to the incoming traffic all the time to try to pass the car in front.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.520]   And then so a lot of times you see like head-on traffic until the very last minute and then
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.520]   they would switch over.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.920]   I felt like I was going to die like all the time, but it was pretty exciting.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.320]   So I guess that was fun.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.480]   When we get to the village, they'd be waiting for us.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   There'd be a ceremony.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.240]   They'd introduce all of us.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.560]   We would sing Indian praise songs.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.600]   We would just clap along because we didn't understand Telugu.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.120]   And then because we often were outside or in an area where it wasn't in an enclosed
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.200]   space, it was like we were proclaiming the word for all to hear.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.160]   Like everyone could hear us.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.000]   Because it was a small village, like literally everyone would be able to hear us singing
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.080]   and talking and proclaiming God's name.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.300]   And then the longer we were there, more and more people would show up because they wanted
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.880]   to see what was going on.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.200]   They wanted some medical care and they would be able to hear the word.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.460]   The actual medical camp actually lasted about four hours.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.780]   And while our goal was to see as many people as possible, we hoped that our presence and
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.780]   our demeanor, despite our language barrier, would show that we're here out of love and
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.420]   that we decided to help them.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.700]   We were giving them glasses, eyedrops, and sunglasses.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.500]   And we would smile.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.980]   We would do the namaste gesture.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.100]   And we hoped that in doing so that their hearts would be softened to hear the message of the
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.240]   gospel.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.540]   And then so that the Indian pastors who visit these villages every day and sometimes new
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.540]   villages, they would be able to preach the word to them.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.420]   They would accept it and then one day proclaim God as their Lord and Savior.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.420]   Thanks honey.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.860]   One funny story about the introductions.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.340]   So you know, Pastor Sake, he didn't know all of our names.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.680]   And so James Hong, he had to give him a list.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.100]   And for the couples, he wrote both on the same line.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.100]   So he wrote Connie and Vince.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.800]   Well, you saw in the picture, in the video, they gave a lei and then we stood up proudly.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.700]   And then he's all, okay, introducing Brother Connie and his wife.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   What?
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.660]   He got it on the third day though.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.060]   Like Connie said, we wanted to use the skills, the skills that seemed essential to the trip.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.220]   You know, eye care was like the rock star medical part that was going to be able to
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.020]   bring as many people as possible.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.700]   And we were pridefully thinking, you know, we want to try to provide the best medical
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.660]   care possible, the absolute, you know, best they can get so that they can, you know, be
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.380]   as healthy as possible.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.700]   And this was going on in our planning stages.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.980]   And after reflecting, after praying, after receiving prayer, we realized that, you know,
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.480]   the medical part was, like Connie said, just an avenue.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.540]   We're actually just going so that they would somehow have a softening of their hearts to
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.780]   the gospel so that the pastors could have an avenue to proclaim the gospel to them and
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.540]   to share the gospel.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.020]   And make no mistake, you know, we weren't the primary evangelistic people there.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.580]   The pastors really do all the work.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.620]   Our purpose on the trip, like I said, was to provide that avenue.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.060]   And through that purpose, we were able to see almost 700 people.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.620]   What was truly amazing about the trip was that God was evident everywhere.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:21.900]   In an area so dark to the gospel, it was clear to see God at work.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.580]   As Connie was explaining, we were, you know, singing in open air.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:31.680]   It was just a tent, and the village is really small, so everyone around could hear.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.940]   And as we were singing, as we were giving testimonies, I looked around, and outside
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.300]   the tent, you can see people with kind of hardened faces, kind of like, "What are you
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.420]   trying to do here?"
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:50.500]   But as they came through, you know, as they received their medical care, went through
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:58.020]   VBS, having gotten glasses, I felt like I saw an inkling of a softening in their hearts
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.700]   just through the softening of their faces.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.860]   You had a Muslim woman take off her face cover.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.300]   You had, you know, parents bringing their kids.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.420]   You had older people who are sometimes the hardest to have a change of heart just show
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:18.780]   just a tremendous amount of gratitude, even though we were Christians there.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.580]   This was our purpose of being there, that softening of their hearts, that inkling of
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.940]   a softening of their hearts so that, you know, the pastors could have that way to really
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.660]   show them who God is, show them who the truth is.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.620]   While we were in India, we had daily devotionals reading 1 Peter, and one verse that kept standing
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.540]   out to me was 1 Peter verses 2 and 3.
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:49.300]   Like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk that you may grow up into salvation if
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.680]   indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.620]   To do what these pastors are doing on a daily basis, that milk must have tasted really good.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:04.980]   They risk their safety, sacrifice comfortable living, give up good education for their children,
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.300]   get ridiculed and sometimes beaten, all to share the gospel to the lost.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.720]   The goodness of God, when you know the taste, is what makes it worth it.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.780]   My prayer is that we are all constantly reminded of the goodness of God because it's knowing
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.300]   this that makes us obedient.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.060]   It's feeling his presence that makes us proclaim his name.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.340]   I also want to share a few thoughts of some of the team members in I-Care.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.700]   Diane Hong shared, "One patient that stood out to me was a desperate mother who heard
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.920]   the word medical and brought her severely sick and malnourished eight-month-old son.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.820]   She came for her son and she knew there was nothing we can do, but she waited in line
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:52.520]   an hour just to receive prayer, the only thing that she could rely on.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.860]   Pastor Peter prayed for her and for her son, and that was one memory that reminded me why
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.440]   we were there, to open up opportunities to minister to the locals there, to offer hope
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.100]   and prayer, and to demonstrate the love of Christ."
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.000]   Anna Yang, "Our discomfort during the trip pales in comparison to the discomfort of the
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.260]   pastors we face, the pastors face daily.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.620]   What a privilege it is to partner alongside these pastors, even for a short week, and
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.460]   to see what an encouragement our presence alone is to them and the joy they have to
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.660]   daily persevere."
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.540]   Jenny Mao, "When going through the villages, we could offer I-Care, but compassion didn't
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.500]   come because they are poor.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.700]   It was because they didn't know the gospel.
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.140]   The most important thing was singing praise and giving testimonies.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.260]   We provided an avenue to proclaim the truth in an otherwise hostile environment.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.080]   We feel rebuked, or I feel rebuked, because my life here is not like in India.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.180]   We should live proclaiming the gospel.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.100]   There is so much work to do."
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:57.060]   Sam Kim from Crosslife, "One of the highlights for the trip was the times that we were able
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.340]   to listen to and proclaim the gospel to the locals through the testimonies of the pastors
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.660]   and of our teammates.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.300]   I was convicted by the gospel's power to transform the lives of the local pastors through the
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.780]   legacy of Pastor Matthew's faithfulness in preaching the gospel."
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.120]   Pastor Matthew, he's Pastor Sake's dad.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.500]   We all noticed the same thing, that God is working in India, that God has his servants
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.700]   in place there, and that the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.300]   I'm truly thankful that Connie and I and our whole team had the privilege to serve
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.940]   God this past week in India, but let us not forget that for his kingdom, there's still
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.500]   much work to do.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   Thank you.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:44.860]   I just want to first thank everyone who prayed for the India mission trip team, as well as
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:51.540]   specifically for the ones who prayed for me to stay focused and to be used, because this
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.260]   trip meant so much to me.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:12:02.320]   But I must first especially thank Esther, because she made it possible for me to go.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.680]   With little or no help, it must have been so hard to be a single mom for so long, both
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.860]   before and during the mission trip.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.860]   So thank you so much.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.260]   It must have been so hard.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.780]   It truly was a family mission trip.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.580]   We all had to do something to make it happen.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:27.220]   In short, our journey started in 2017 with Covenant Keepers.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:34.380]   We did a book called You and Me Forever by Francis and Lisa Chan.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.700]   That's when God revealed to me that I had a marriage-centered marriage instead of a
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.700]   God-centered marriage.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.980]   Not that good marriage isn't good.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:48.140]   It's not that five loving languages and supporting each other and trying to keep a good family
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.340]   is bad.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:58.700]   But in the midst of the daily grind of daily life, providing for our family, I had to admit
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.940]   that God wasn't in the priority.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.660]   And that was a hard reality.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:14.700]   So when India Mission Trip opportunity came up, we answered the call.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.820]   I wish I could say otherwise, but it wasn't the love for India or even the love for missions
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.260]   that drew us.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:32.640]   It was a simple, small step of obedience and faith that we took.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.700]   We want and we pray for our children to be mighty warriors for Christ and for the kingdom.
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.180]   But first I must model it at home.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.220]   I want to be like Elijah who rained down the fire from heaven.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.100]   I want to be like great men of faith in the Bible.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.220]   But sometimes I look at my life and I look at the Bible and there's a chasm of a difference.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.420]   I feel like I'm reading a fairy tale story.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.380]   India was the first step towards that.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.140]   In India, we took the gospel to the gates of Hades.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.540]   Even with the language barrier, with our eyes and with our service and our obedience, we
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.300]   brought the gospel.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:21.860]   I ask you continually to pray for me to stay sober-minded after a mountaintop experience,
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.520]   to live for Christ in the midst of a daily grind.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:31.060]   In doing so, I encourage you to answer God's call in your own life, where you're at, with
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.980]   whom you're with.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:39.580]   Elder Joe once put it best, he said, "Sunday service is like a pep rally for all of us
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:46.260]   believers to get together, to encourage one another and to spur each other on for the
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.740]   week ahead."
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:56.760]   So it's my privilege and honor to lead this pep rally today, to encourage you to take
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.840]   the gospel from where you're at, with who you're with, to the gates of Hades, to kick
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:10.440]   it open, to reach deep inside, to the clutches of death, rip out from its throat, to souls
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.440]   for God, the ones that we call our mother and father, our brothers and sisters, our
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.880]   coworkers and our neighbors, our friends, our casual acquaintances.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.000]   Thank you.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.640]   I'm going to be preaching the part two of the "I Am Statements of Christ," and I'm going
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.880]   to just kind of give you updates on my version.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.320]   Again, thank you, Lee, for sharing your heart.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:44.700]   We had a team of 15, four optometrists and one eye doctor, optometrists, and we had nurses
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:51.800]   and we had VBS team and one strong security guard who kept people at bay.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.600]   And so it was, you know, it's always great.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.120]   And people ask, like, what's the highlight of the mission trip?
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.440]   For me, it's always the same.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.920]   It's always being able to spend time with my brothers and sisters, to labor together,
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.920]   to enjoy true fellowship.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.280]   And, you know, every time I go to mission trips, it kind of reminded me of how our church
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.000]   used to be when it was a lot smaller, to be able to interact with everyone every day and
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.240]   to pray for each other, enjoy each other's company, and to be able to do that on a day
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.720]   in and day out basis and laboring together, even though we're fatigued, seeing everybody
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.160]   just working so hard to do the best that they can is such an encouragement.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.160]   I think we looked at the number of people that we saw.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.200]   I think last year we may have seen maybe about 300, 350, and we thought that was a huge number.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.920]   And this year, they broke the record.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.520]   They did almost double that, 600 to 650 people that they saw.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.520]   And it wasn't because we saw everybody.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.440]   Every day, the crowd that we had to say no to is increasing at the end of the day, so
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.080]   we always have to leave because we don't want to leave after the sun goes down.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.840]   And it was, again, such an encouraging experience.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.360]   And, you know, when I think about India, you know, people ask, like, why do you have a
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.320]   heart for India?
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.360]   And it's not because I have a heart for India or for China or any other place.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.280]   It just happened that God opened the door.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.720]   And you know, I was asked to go years ago, about seven years ago, to go and teach a pastoral
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.800]   training out in Bangalore.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.680]   And I went there, and I didn't come back with a heart for India.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.600]   I came back with the realization that the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.680]   And there's a lot of work to be done.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.000]   I didn't know.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.400]   I thought that the greatest unreached people, concentration of people groups was in the
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.800]   Middle East, and I found out that it was actually in India.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.280]   And that there's, even though there are a lot of people doing ministry, but the persecution
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.360]   is rising, so a lot more people are being cautious.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.960]   And so as a result of that, I came back with, again, with a knowledge that there is a tremendous
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.040]   amount of need and not enough being done over there, in comparison to where you and I live,
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.120]   where it almost seems like churches are competing with each other to gain more people to come
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.040]   to their church instead of the church down the street, where there are parts of the world
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.880]   right now where there's not even a single pastor, a single person or Christian being
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.440]   represented in some of these villages.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.680]   And so really, it was because the door has been opened.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.880]   And Apostle Paul talks about that in 1 Corinthians 16, 9, where he writes his letter and he said
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.560]   he's going to spend more time in Macedonia because the Lord opened the door for him to
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.320]   do ministry.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:34.160]   And so heart is something that God gives you in obedience.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.640]   We don't follow our heart because our heart is very deceptive.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.480]   If we go where we want to go and not go where we don't want to go, you'll end up right at
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.300]   home building a comfortable safety net and do whatever is comfortable.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.600]   So we kind of make this boundary of what God wants in my life based upon what is comfortable
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   to me.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.000]   And the next thing you know, you find your life living in disobedience.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And so India is not because God gave me a heart, it's because he opened the door.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.440]   But I also come back, as I shared with the team, the realization that this door may not
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.840]   be open permanently.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.040]   When we went, part of the reason why we were safe is because now that this was our fourth
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.640]   year doing this medical camp, they've already heard about what we've done in the previous
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   years.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.280]   And so the village leaders who are Hindus are actually asking us to come to their village.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:29.960]   And you could see when you start the beginning of the day, we have all of us in a room and
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.180]   you have the Christians, the pastors, and a lot of the village people and the leader
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.000]   of the village, who many of them are Hindus, will sit there.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.600]   And once the singing starts and the gospel and the testimony begins, you can begin to
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.000]   see the discomfort in some people.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.520]   And some people will just literally just get up and walk out.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.120]   They'll grab their wives and their kids.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.320]   So you can see the discomfort.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.780]   And they're just kind of examining what are these people doing here.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:00.560]   But once the medical camp starts, even the people who left, for whatever the reason,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.400]   they'll start coming back.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.940]   And they'll make lines and literally begging us to see them.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.760]   And even at the very end of the camp, we had four reporters who came and asked if they
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.000]   can take pictures and write about us in their newspaper.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.960]   Because a lot of these villages haven't had a foreigner in their village for over 30,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   40 years.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.500]   So it's a very strange sight to see foreigners coming in there doing what we're doing.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.560]   So they want to write about it because over there, it's a very big event.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.280]   And the leaders, some of the pastors that I talked to said that the very first year
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.440]   that we went, the way that they prepared for these camps is if we were doing the camp on
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.840]   Monday at a particular village, the pastors would go the night before and they would walk
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.000]   around with drums and they would beat and just tell people announcing that there's a
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.520]   medical camp coming next day, so make sure you guys come.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.720]   So each village we went to, there was a large number of people already waiting for us.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.960]   They said that they can't do public campaigns anymore because they're not well received.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.040]   So that's the way that they would do evangelism.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.640]   They would go and drum up support and say, "Hey, we're having this event, come," and
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.320]   they would just publicly preach the gospel.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.500]   And they said they stopped doing that because the village leaders won't allow it anymore.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.360]   So the way they do evangelism now is they would find if there's a Christian in the village,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.660]   they would go to their homes and then ask them to invite their non-Christian Hindu friends
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.240]   to come and they would share the gospel inside the house.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.880]   So inside the house they can do it, but they can't do public events.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.800]   So the fact that we're having this public event and having hundreds and hundreds of
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.520]   people show up, again, this is a very rare happening in that village, and the fact that
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.000]   we're sharing the gospel.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.840]   And I think about the eye care and the wound care that we do, and probably the most offensive
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.960]   part of what we do is the VBS.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:53.080]   One because it is just direct gospel sharing with these children, singing songs and having
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.280]   them present the gospel through the different beads, and the fact that they're doing it
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.760]   with their children.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.120]   And so a lot of times the parents are sitting there and watching, and they're hearing the
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.520]   gospel being presented through the VBS, and yet they'll sit there through the whole day
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.920]   because they're trying to get into the medical camp.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.980]   And so a lot of work is being done, but at the same time I realize that this door may
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.080]   not be open permanently.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.000]   That because we're garnering a lot of attention and we ask the reporters not to take the
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.120]   pictures, not to write about us, for obvious reasons.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.200]   We don't want the unwanted attention of people reading it and then the radical Hindus figuring
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.520]   out what we're doing and then coming and causing problems for us.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.880]   So we try to ask them not to do this, but I have a feeling that they're going to do
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.920]   that anyway because it was such a big event for them.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:49.160]   So I'm not sure how long the door is going to be open and how much time we have and opportunity
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.240]   to do exactly what we're doing, not that our support for the pastors there is going to
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.560]   stop anytime soon, but the specific thing of going there.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.000]   And again, what we're doing is very effective.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.680]   I feel like not a single minute, not a single dime is wasted in the work that we're doing
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.240]   out in India.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.480]   But again, I don't know how long the Lord will keep this door open, but as long as it
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.360]   is open, we want to make sure that we take advantage of it and we live in obedience.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.800]   And again, I was talking to a few of our team members and what they shared was how when
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.200]   they first went, everybody looks the same.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.080]   Anytime you go to a foreign place where you're not familiar, say, well, everybody kind of
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.660]   go to the villages and you just see the masses.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.560]   But now that we've been there four times, it's no longer the masses.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   You see the people.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.280]   You see the story behind the people who are coming.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.600]   And they're not just a group of people.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.520]   They're not just Indians.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.000]   They're people who have brothers and sisters and they have heartaches and they have a hard
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.880]   time feeding their children.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:01.840]   And we've met a lady who had a child born premature and it was in one of the pictures
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:07.280]   and the baby looked like it didn't have much to live and the mother has no hope.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.360]   And there's nothing we could do there because it was an eye camp and wound care and the
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.160]   child's lung wasn't developed and wasn't eating and it was clear that the baby was
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.360]   in his last days of life and the mother came and asked for prayer.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.040]   And so we prayed for her.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.560]   We prayed for the baby.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.960]   And so we had several instances where we were able to sit down and talk with them and to
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.760]   pray for what's going on in their lives.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:37.160]   And so it's no longer, to me, just these Indians out in the middle of nowhere, but these are
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.120]   people who have faces, the people that we've met.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.960]   And so God gives us a heart when we obey.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.440]   We don't move because we have a heart.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:53.040]   A heart will follow if we submit to God.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.640]   The text that we're looking at today, again, all the messages, if you listen carefully,
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:05.040]   they're all tied together to know who Christ truly is.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.240]   Obviously we're not there for humanitarian aid.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:12.080]   Ultimately, getting people who don't see to see better is not the main reason why we
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.080]   went.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.120]   Or children who need to learn about morality and to have a different code of ethics, Christian
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.400]   ethics instead of Hindu ethics.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.280]   That is not why we're there.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.440]   We're there ultimately that that is an avenue, a vehicle to bring the gospel, to bring the
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.520]   message of Christ, to introduce them to Jesus.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.040]   Because of our language barrier, obviously we're just giving a platform for the pastors
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.120]   to be able to preach boldly, which they do.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.800]   But ultimately it is about the gospel.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.400]   It is not about the wound care.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.320]   It is not about the eye care and all the other things.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:54.160]   See the I Am statements of Jesus is taking a group of people who were coming to Christ
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   in large numbers.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.760]   If you remember the first I Am statement, Jesus says, "I am the bread of life."
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.000]   It reminded me a lot.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.760]   Every day when we had these groups of people, 200, 300, 400 people coming to these camps,
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.800]   and every second that you have, James had the toughest job out of all of us because
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.840]   basically he's doing crowd control all day long.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.640]   Crowd control is not like here where you say, "Hey, you guys got to stand in line."
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   They stand in line and every once in a while you have to remember.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:28.280]   Every second you don't push back and you don't do crowd control.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.360]   You have dozens and dozens of people who are trying to break in, trying to go.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.440]   If you turn away, they're sneaking in.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.000]   Every time the door opens, they're peeking in.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.760]   James and the security team has to constantly be there all day fighting to keep the crowd
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.640]   in control.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:53.540]   But can you imagine that Jesus and his 12 disciples, what kind of crowd followed Jesus?
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:58.080]   At the feeding of the 5,000, it's like 5,000 plus their family members, maybe 20,000 people
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.680]   and only 12 disciples and possibly a few of the women disciples were following them.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.600]   They were so enamored with Christ.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:12.280]   Remember when Jesus was teaching in possibly Peter's house that they couldn't get to him
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.400]   through the front door.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.600]   The only way that they can get to him is to go to the roof and break it open and put him
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   down.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.320]   So the scene that we experienced at the village is a small fraction of what I think was probably
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.760]   going on everywhere Jesus went.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.840]   They had thousands of people.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   We have hundreds.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.880]   They have thousands of people.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.640]   We had maybe about 20 or 30, including us and the pastors who were doing crowd control.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.440]   But this is 12 disciples and a few women and thousands of people are knocking at his door.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:46.080]   The people in the villages are desperate because a lot of them, the only medical attention
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.520]   they can get may be us.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.240]   It's no wonder that they're desperate and that why they're trying everything in their
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.240]   power to get in.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:28:00.360]   But can you imagine people who haven't eaten, who can't see, can't walk, oppressed, seeing
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.760]   that Jesus is performing miracles and he's the only person that has any kind of solution
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   for all of this.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.880]   And they're coming in thousands everywhere he went.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.080]   So can you imagine how fatigued Jesus and the disciples were and why he was constantly
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.840]   trying to get away to get a break?
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:22.840]   It is to that crowd, these multitudes who are coming to Jesus at all costs, breaking
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.920]   through the door, fighting through the crowd just to get a glimpse of him, just to touch
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:31.840]   the fringe of his garment, hoping that healing will come.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   That it is in this crowd that Jesus sees them and he sees the defect of their faith, that
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.640]   they're coming to him for the wrong reason.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   Understandably, if you're hungry, you want food.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.440]   Understandably, if you're sick, you want to be healed.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.600]   But in the context of all of this, they could have easily missed why Jesus came.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.320]   That is not the reason why Jesus came.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:00.600]   He says he performed miracles in order that they would know him, that they would know
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:07.720]   him because the real reason why he came is to reconcile us to the author of life.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.300]   So that was just an avenue, just like our medical camp was simply an avenue to bring
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.820]   Christ to them.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:18.860]   Everything that Jesus did, the feeding, the healing, his power, all of it was to bring
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.260]   people to himself.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:26.720]   So these "I am" statements are a clarification of some of the misunderstandings that people
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.960]   had for the false reasons that many people were clamoring to get to Jesus.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.980]   And Jesus says in these "I am" statements that you need to know who I am.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:42.240]   We talked about the first four the previous weeks, and then I want to look at the next
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   three.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.000]   And all three of these "I am" statements, the "I am the resurrection and life," "I
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.920]   am the way and the truth and the life," and then "I am divine," all three of these
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.600]   "I am" statements happen at the very, very tail end of Jesus' ministry.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.720]   "I am the resurrection and the life" happens the very last week before he enters into Jerusalem.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.480]   So we're talking about two weeks before he is crucified on the cross.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.920]   So every one of these statements are stated in the context of him telling and preparing
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.480]   his disciples for his departure.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.200]   So the fourth and the first "I am" statement that I'm going to be addressing today is
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.480]   the "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.720]   Again the context is in chapter 11.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.480]   He says it in verse 25 and 26, and again in various places, where the context is Jesus
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.200]   has this personal relationship with his family, Lazarus, Mary, and Martha.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.760]   And they are mentioned in other texts outside of this miracle.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.560]   And we could tell that they were a prominent family just by the fact that they were already
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   very well known in the Jewish community.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.360]   And when Lazarus is buried, he's buried in a tomb very similar to Jesus' tomb, which
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.600]   was not a common man's tomb.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.760]   You have to be very wealthy to have a tomb carved into the side of the mountain very
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.600]   similar to what Jesus was buried in.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.040]   This was a rich man's tomb.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:08.000]   So Mary, Martha, and Lazarus was probably a very prominent family that Jesus was close
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.480]   to, maybe supported Jesus' ministry.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:18.060]   And so when Lazarus seems like his illness is very severe, they send messengers to go
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.720]   get Jesus, and Jesus responds in verse 4, chapter 11, says, "This illness does not
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.720]   lead to death.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.680]   It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of Man may be glorified through it."
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.160]   Jesus is already aware of what's going to happen.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.360]   Even before they come and get him, he says, "No, this is not going to lead to death.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.840]   It's going to lead to his glory."
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.900]   But he doesn't immediately move.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.660]   He deliberately stays two days longer, it says in chapter 11, verse 6.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:46.780]   He waits until he dies, and he's buried, and for four days he's buried, and he's
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.220]   already in the tomb where the body is starting to rot.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:57.100]   And he deliberately waits for that, and then he shows up after he dies in verse 21 through
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.100]   26.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.320]   Martha runs to Jesus and says, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.300]   have died, but even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you."
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:12.780]   In other words, we were waiting, anticipating, because they had a special connection to Jesus.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.860]   They weren't like the multitudes.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.580]   They had access to him, and they thought that we're desperate and we go get you, that
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.460]   you would come running, but Jesus did not.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.980]   And in disappointment, she's lost hope.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.780]   If you came before he died, you could have done something, but now that he's dead,
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.780]   what's going to happen?
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.700]   Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.580]   And even then, Martha did not clearly understand.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.060]   He says, Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.740]   the last day."
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.300]   Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:50.460]   Whoever believes me, though he die, yet shall he live.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.060]   And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.180]   Do you believe this?"
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:03.820]   Jesus is saying to Martha and the crowd that was gathered together, "You are clinging
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.820]   to life."
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:10.620]   Understandably, because every human being, from the moment that you are born, you learn
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.820]   how to suck.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.820]   You learn how to eat.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.500]   You learn how to sleep.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.060]   We have a survival instinct.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.300]   When danger is around, we avoid it like a plague.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.300]   We want to live.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.860]   Not only do we want to physically live, we want to feel alive.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.620]   So we work hard to make money so that we can use that money so that we can live.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.420]   How many times do we say, you know, we work during the weekday and we live during the
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.820]   weekend?
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.420]   So we want to not only exist, but we want to feel alive.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:48.100]   See, as long as Lazarus had breath in his body, there was hope.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.820]   Like everybody else.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:56.220]   It is in this context that Jesus warns them and he corrects them.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.220]   It is not the oxygen.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.020]   It is not the physical body.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.700]   It is not what you do.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:07.740]   Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:13.860]   He didn't come to prolong Lazarus' life so that he wouldn't die as a young man, but if
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.940]   he is blessed by God, that he would die as an old man.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.900]   He didn't come so that somebody who couldn't see could see and live a normal life like
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.980]   anybody else did.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.460]   He didn't come so that the poor, their stomach would be fed and they wouldn't experience
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:34.020]   hunger pains for a period, just like everybody else.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.420]   That is not why he came.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:41.700]   Because in the end, the scripture says, "Inasmuch as it is appointed for all men to die once,
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.180]   after this comes judgment."
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.080]   He came to deliver us from that judgment.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.580]   Not to deliver us from poverty, not to deliver us from illness, not to deliver us from illnesses
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:59.140]   or bad memories, but to deliver us from the judgment that is coming without the atonement
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.260]   for our sins.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.660]   He did everything he did, ultimately to bring them to himself.
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:13.700]   It wasn't a longer life, a better life, a comfortable life, that's why he came.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.820]   He came to introduce us to himself.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.020]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:26.380]   Colossians 3, 4, it says, "When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.780]   appear with him in glory."
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.220]   We may not fully experience this life that Jesus came to give us.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.320]   And that's why we eagerly anticipate his second coming.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.780]   Not so that the good life that we have will be better when Christ comes.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:49.620]   He says, "Your life that's hidden in Christ will appear and we will experience that glory
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.080]   when he comes."
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:56.880]   John 10, 10 says, "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy."
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.640]   Well who's the thief that he's talking about?
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:05.880]   Anybody that is not Christ, anybody that does not introduce Christ, anybody who presents
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.240]   anything else but Jesus Christ as life is a thief.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.360]   He has come to destroy life, to kill.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:23.600]   And what is introduced to us as a form of life ultimately ends in death and condemnation.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.480]   But Christ himself comes and he says to deny your life, to pick up your claws.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.700]   But at the end of that road is eternal life.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.260]   He came to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.360]   If you find life in anything else, that's what you will pursue.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.760]   It doesn't matter what you confess on Sunday.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.640]   It doesn't matter what your doctrinal statement is.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.880]   If you find life in anything else outside of Christ, that's exactly what you are pursuing
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.160]   today.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.200]   If vacations, that's where you find life, then you'll put in all the work and make the
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.440]   sacrifices to get to your vacation, to get to travel, to get to eat.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.240]   It's what you are pursuing.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.960]   It's what you fantasize about with the spare time that you have.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:11.160]   It is where you find life.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.360]   If you believe that Jesus Christ is life, that is what you will pursue.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.440]   And you know as well as I do, you can come to church and not be pursuing Christ.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.200]   And that is the strange thing about being a Christian in our generation, in this part
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   of the world.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:33.160]   1 Peter 4, 12-13, Peter says, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.720]   comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you."
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.960]   He's saying when these trials come, and we're talking about trials where it may end in their
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.000]   life.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.320]   And Peter is telling them, "When this happens, don't think it's strange.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.440]   Jesus warned you, Paul warned you, every disciple warned you, that if you follow Christ, you're
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.680]   going to have to pick up your cross."
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.840]   So when the time comes when you actually have to pick up the cross, he said, "Do not think
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.720]   it's strange."
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:09.080]   Believers here who've been raised in the Western church, when we go to places like India, it's
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   very strange.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.200]   Obviously, there are cultural things that are strange, because there's a lot of idol
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.720]   worships and you see temples everywhere you go.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.960]   And so in that, it is strange.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.640]   But a lot of times, what we see in Christianity is also very strange.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:28.440]   To live your life where you're literally sacrificing, feeding your children to get the gospel out,
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:33.120]   walking into villages to share the gospel, and then living out in the streets sometimes
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.180]   because they wouldn't be hospitable to you, that's very strange.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.480]   To be worried about your neighbors coming into your house and beating you for having
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.040]   worship and not worshiping idols, it's very strange to us, because that's not what we
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   experience.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:52.820]   We admire it from a distance, but it's very strange to us.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:58.780]   But let's be honest, that is not what's strange, because we are warned about that.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.340]   We were taught about that.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:04.440]   All throughout church history, we see traces of that, examples of it.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:09.140]   What is strange is the Christianity that you and I experience that has become normal in
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.140]   our generation.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:15.440]   It has become normal to confess Christ as Lord and never consider what that lordship
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.160]   means.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.280]   That is very strange.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.220]   It is very strange to say that our relationship with God has been restored and never pray.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.600]   That's very strange.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:33.540]   It's very strange to say that our friends and family members are going to be condemned
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:39.400]   to hell if their sins are not forgiven, and then not to be on our knees every day praying
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.000]   for their salvation and making every effort to get the gospel out.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.040]   That is very strange.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:52.040]   It is very strange to have friendship centered on Christ where Christ's name never comes
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.680]   up in our conversations.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.160]   That is very strange.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.000]   What we experience, the Christianity that you and I have become accustomed to, what
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.280]   has become normal in our Western churches is very strange.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:12.200]   If Christ was to come and stand in our midst, I think he will recognize what he sees in
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.600]   India but he will not recognize what he sees here.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.880]   What you and I experience is very strange.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.520]   It is not consistent with the songs that we sing.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.360]   It is not consistent with the doctrines that we profess.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:31.000]   Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.040]   I think about that lady that we met.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.640]   The pastor introduced me to her.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.080]   She was a young lady.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.720]   I don't know how old she was, but she must have been no more than mid to late 20s, at
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   most.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.920]   She was very young.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.440]   She said that she wanted us to pray for her because she's having a really difficult time.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.840]   Her and her husband became a Christian not too long ago, and she was three months pregnant
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.680]   with a child when they converted.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.360]   Soon after, her husband, right after the conversion, has a heart attack and he dies.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.000]   And then not too long after that, her father also passes away.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.620]   And so the village leaders took it upon themselves to use that to condemn Christianity and was
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:16.960]   condemning her and saying, "Look, it's because you converted from Hinduism that you're being
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.880]   punished by the gods, and that's why your husband died, and that's why your father died."
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.480]   So you have to understand that there is no government help for her.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.760]   She's living in a village where if her husband doesn't work, even if her husband worked,
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.080]   they'd barely survive, but not that the husband's gone, and she has a small child, and the father,
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.160]   who's also a provider, is gone.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.320]   She's having a tough life.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.560]   And on top of that, all her neighbors are mocking her for turning to Christ.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:50.080]   So the pastors told me that, again, they are barely scraping and surviving themselves,
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.800]   and what little money that they have, they're buying food for her so that she can survive.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.420]   So we had an opportunity to talk to her and pray for her.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:05.360]   But what would cause somebody like her to continue in her faith?
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.360]   What would cause her to not turn to God and shake her fist at God?
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.080]   I trusted you.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:20.200]   Because I became a Christian, look at the context that I'm in.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:24.520]   What causes her to persevere?
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:33.440]   You see, this is what Jesus means, not only to Mary and Martha and Lazarus, but to us
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.600]   and to her.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.080]   Jesus is the resurrection and the life.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.880]   Jesus is the resurrection and the life.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.840]   The only thing somebody in her context would cause her to persevere in her faith is because
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.540]   she believes that even in death there's life in Christ.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:59.280]   Even if she can't eat, even if she's being mocked, even if her life becomes harder because
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.560]   she believed in Jesus, because the hope that we have in Jesus as a resurrection and life
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.720]   cannot be shaken, even in death.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.040]   That's what Jesus was saying to Martha.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.080]   You're hoping that I can raise him from the dead and I will raise him from the dead, but
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.160]   you're going to miss the whole point if you think that that's why I came.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:24.280]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.800]   The only reason why we persevere in our faith, the only reason why we share the gospel in
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:34.080]   the context of persecution, why these men have such courage is because they have come
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.680]   to believe this.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:45.720]   Again, it is very strange to profess this and then believe this and not have it affect
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:54.680]   what you do with your money, not have it affect what you do with your free time, that our
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:59.120]   life doesn't look any different other than the fact that we're active at church.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.920]   It's very strange.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:09.880]   Jesus says in Acts 4.12, "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:15.240]   other than the one given among men by which we must be saved."
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.580]   Salvation is in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.800]   We can feed them, but if we don't bring them to Christ, we've missed the point.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.680]   We can give them eye care and cause them to see.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.800]   We can get people who may die and pray for them and bring new life into them, and if
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.520]   they do not meet Christ, we've missed the whole point.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.560]   Jesus is the resurrection and life.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:40.400]   The other two "I am" statements basically is the same thing.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.560]   The main point of what Jesus is saying is what he says, "I am the resurrection and
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   life."
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.880]   The other is to continue to emphasize and point to that.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:51.840]   He says, "I am the way and the truth and the life," chapter 14, verse 6.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.600]   You know, what's interesting is that this is a verse that I memorized as a young child.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.360]   I remember going to a VBS when I was about third or fourth grade, and the VBS t-shirt
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.800]   had that verse on it.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.560]   I had no idea what it meant.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.240]   I just remember seeing it on the t-shirt and riding in the back seat, and one of my brothers
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.600]   would have that on the back of his shirt, and I just, "I am the way and the truth and
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   the life.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:19.200]   I had no idea what that meant until I became a Christian.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.480]   I think a lot of people in the church, even as a Christian, don't fully understand what
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.280]   this means.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:32.400]   He's saying, you know what's interesting, the grammar here, that each one of these words,
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.120]   he doesn't say, "I am a way, I am a truth, I am a life."
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   He says, "I am the."
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.000]   There's a definite article "the" in front of each of these statements for the purpose
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   of emphasis.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.280]   Just like we said, no, he's not a friend.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.640]   He is the friend.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.920]   He's the most important friend.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.940]   And so Jesus is saying, "I am the way."
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.760]   There is no other way.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.880]   There is no, "I tried Jesus on Sunday, it doesn't work, so I'm going to try something
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   else."
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   I am the way.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.720]   If he doesn't work, you have no other hope.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.440]   He's not saying he is a truth among many truths.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.440]   He's the best truth.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.360]   He says, "I am the truth."
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:15.440]   If the truth of Christ doesn't work, you have no other truth.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.020]   I am the life.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:23.120]   If you don't find life in Christ and you try to find life in any other way, you are
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.960]   without hope because he is the life.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.040]   That's what he means when he says, "I am the way, I am the truth, I am the life."
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:41.440]   Now you may have understood that theologically, but do you really believe this?
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.940]   Do you really believe this?
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.040]   How many people in our generation actually believe this?
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:51.320]   Because if we believe this, it would change us radically.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:59.020]   If he's the way, the truth, and the life, how can we spend all of our lives pursuing
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.220]   something else and only pursuing him over the weekend?
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.680]   That's very strange.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:09.780]   He's telling his disciples that he's going to depart and where I am going, you cannot
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.780]   come.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:16.500]   He's very aware that because he's going to the cross, many people are going to abandon
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.540]   him.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:21.940]   He says to Peter and his disciples that where I'm going, you cannot come.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.580]   Peter said to him, "Lord, why can I not follow you?
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.220]   I will lay down my life for you."
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.620]   Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me?
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.740]   Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times."
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:40.740]   Jesus knew very well that even his closest companion, Peter, is not going to understand
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.860]   what Jesus was doing, even though he made it very clear to him that every minute that
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:49.140]   he spent with his disciples, he was preparing him for the cross, but he knew that when he
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.460]   went to the cross, that they would deny him.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.900]   They're going to fail miserably.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:48:00.100]   As a result of that, many, many, these multitudes were fighting through the crowds to get to
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:05.220]   him, no longer would follow him as a result of that.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:12.180]   Jesus is preparing his disciples for this, for this mass turning from Jesus, going back
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:18.780]   to their old life, and he's telling them, "You may not understand what I'm doing.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.540]   In time, it will be revealed to you.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:28.700]   As I go to the cross, you may be confused because what you thought isn't going to happen."
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.460]   It is in that context that Jesus is preparing them.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.840]   Even if everybody falls away, there is no other way.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:41.980]   When the multitudes turn from me and turn back to their old life, I am the way.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.600]   I am the truth.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.040]   I am the life.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:50.740]   No one can come to the Father but through me.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:56.300]   If you want to be restored to the author of life, Jesus is the only one.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:00.600]   If you want the truth, Jesus is the only truth.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:06.180]   If you're lost and looking for the right way, Jesus is the only way.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:12.300]   First Timothy 2.5, "For there is one God, there is one mediator between God and men,
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:16.060]   the man Christ Jesus."
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:20.780]   Pastor Matthew, he's the guy who started this whole ministry out in India, and every single
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:25.740]   pastor who gave a testimony shared about how Pastor Matthew brought the gospel to them.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:30.460]   This is why I was intrigued and went to India to meet them in the first place, because the
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.260]   whole time I was talking to his son, Pastor Sake, he would never talk about himself.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.660]   He would always talk about his father, his father's testimony, how he came to Christ
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.420]   and how he persevered.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:47.260]   He told me as a young child, his memory of his childhood is not good because he remembers
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.500]   sleeping out in the streets.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.320]   He remembers going to villages and being chased out.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:56.580]   As a young child, they had four children, but when he converted, he had his oldest son,
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:00.440]   Pastor Isaac, and the second one, Pastor Sake.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.740]   After that, he had his third son, Pastor David, and then a daughter who was also married to
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.940]   a pastor.
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:11.780]   A couple years ago, I had an opportunity to interview Pastor Matthew, and I asked him,
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.660]   "Tell me a little bit about your testimony."
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:20.780]   Typically, you would hear, whenever you hear about this great man, at least when I heard
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:26.620]   from the other pastors, how he was persecuted and he went out and did this crazy work.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:31.980]   As a result of that, he has this network of pastors evangelizing to areas that never heard
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.480]   the gospel.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:41.340]   But I was so encouraged by his testimony because he shared with me that at an earlier part
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.260]   of his ministry, he said he wanted to die.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:53.940]   I said, "That's a strange thing to hear from a man who's been so strong in his faith, and
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:59.340]   everybody's just completely dependent on this man, even all the pastors.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:05.340]   They're leaning on his faith for him to say that at one point, he just wanted to die."
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:10.100]   He's out there proclaiming the gospel and promising life in the name of Jesus, and he's
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.860]   confessing honestly that at one point, he wanted to end his life.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:18.860]   He said the reason why is because he saw his children and his wife suffering.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:24.100]   At times, many, many times, he couldn't feed his kids because he would walk into a village,
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.380]   and just like the New Testament, if they blessed him, they would give him some food, and they
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:32.140]   would sleep at his house, and then the next day, they would go on doing the ministry.
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.140]   Exactly.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.780]   So this is a man who just read the Bible and just applied it directly.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.460]   Exactly what it says.
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:41.580]   If they didn't receive him, he would shake off the dust and go to the next town.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:46.900]   But a lot of times, he would be there late at night, and no one would welcome him to
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.700]   their house, no one would feed them, and it was too late to walk out because it takes
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.540]   anywhere from an hour to two hours to come in and out of these villages.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.220]   He said they would just go into the fields, and him and his two young children would just
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:03.240]   sleep, and they would go hungry until they go to the next village, and somebody opens
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:06.340]   their house and gives them food to eat.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.560]   That's what his ministry was like.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:17.020]   So he had thoughts that maybe if I just disappeared, that this burden would be lifted from my family,
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.420]   my wife and my children could have a normal life.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:23.900]   And he said, "Yeah, they were difficult periods."
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:32.460]   You know, the first thought that we may have is, "Why don't you just stop it then?
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.860]   If it was so hard, why do it?"
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:40.780]   The majority of the Christians don't do what he's doing.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.780]   All you have to do is just stop.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.060]   Go get a job.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.740]   Make money like everybody else and feed your kids.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:52.340]   Evangelize on the weekend when it's convenient, after everything is taken care of.
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:58.460]   Why take your family to the point where he wants to end his life to take the burden off
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.380]   of himself and his family?
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:07.060]   The answer is pretty clear.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:14.200]   He believed that Jesus was the way and the truth and the life.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.420]   No one comes to the Father but through him.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:24.980]   It would be easier for him to take his life than to deny what he believed.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:31.580]   It was easier for him to just disappear than to deny the truth that radically changed him.
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:37.540]   The love of Christ was compelling him to preach the gospel, even as his family suffered.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:44.180]   The only reason why he continued is because he was so convinced of this truth.
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:48.060]   What you and I experience and practice today is strange.
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:52.080]   We're trying very hard not to make it strange, but it is strange.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.900]   What he is doing is not strange.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:01.620]   It is a reasonable response to the tremendous mercy he has received.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.380]   Third and finally, he says, "I am divine."
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:11.140]   He says this in the context in the last "I am" statements to prepare his disciples because
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.260]   they were living in fear.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.460]   If Jesus actually carries out what he said he was going to do, he says, "I am going to
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:21.320]   leave and where I go, you cannot come," and they're freaking out.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.480]   How can I not come?
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:30.100]   As long as Jesus was with them, when the enemies came to beat him and to kill him, they were
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.640]   safe.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:37.860]   But Jesus deliberately walks into Jerusalem, the epicenter of the enemies.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.740]   For the last three years, we're trying to kill him, and Jesus was walking right in.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:47.100]   Now Jesus says, not only is he walking in, taking his disciples to the lion's den, he
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.700]   said, "I am going to leave you."
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:57.980]   To these disciples who are in fear and trembling, hoping that maybe they misunderstood, Jesus
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:04.160]   says, "I am the true vine and you are the branches, and you cannot bear any fruit unless
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.880]   you abide in me."
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:11.840]   The word "abide" here is a key Christian word, just like the word "love," that we have to
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:16.340]   make sure that we don't add meaning to this, that we understand it exactly as Jesus said
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:22.120]   it, because basically what he is saying here with the "I am" statement, or that he is divine,
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:28.640]   is that the key to your Christian life, the key to bearing any fruit, is this, abiding
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   in Christ.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:37.000]   It is not technology, it is not money, it is not organization, it is not your gifting,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.340]   it is not your prior success.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:46.120]   Whatever you've been successful in, you cannot apply to Christianity.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:51.240]   Because you will ruin it, because it is filled with your personal pride, and you get the
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.280]   glory.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.440]   So much of what we try to apply to Christianity ultimately results in saying, "You are so
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.360]   smart, you're a genius."
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:10.520]   Everything about Christianity is to bring us to the point to recognize that we are utterly
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.200]   dependent upon him.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:19.280]   So the most important, the most powerful thing that God ever leads us to is to recognize
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.400]   our weakness and to cling to him with all our might.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.840]   And that's why he says, "If you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.960]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:31.000]   That's where the power is.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.280]   Power is not in your past experience, power is not in your past success, power is not
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.840]   in your gifting or education or your money.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:48.400]   The power is when we abide in Christ, that he gives us full access to himself, that we
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.520]   can pray.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.960]   That's where the power is.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:58.000]   And until we mature to the point where prayer is not something we sprinkle upon what we
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:05.320]   do, but we saturate and devote ourselves to prayer, you have not matured.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:13.040]   Prayer is our tangible way to acknowledge that the power is in him, not us.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:17.480]   And that's why he says, "You have to abide."
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.800]   Because our primary problem is not persecution here.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.760]   Persecution actually is very sanctifying for the church.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.780]   I asked one of the pastors years ago, I said, "Now the persecution is increasing, how does
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:31.040]   it affect your ministry in the church?"
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.640]   And he said, "It's actually been very good.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.600]   Because it purifies the church.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.240]   The nominal Christians will not turn to Christ.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:43.680]   Pastors who are coming in for any other reason other than being convicted by the gospel will
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.240]   not pastor."
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.520]   So it has purified the church, so the fellowship is sweeter, the gathering, the singing, all
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.680]   that they do has become pure.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.960]   So he said, "It's actually been good for us."
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.260]   See, that is not our problem.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:02.440]   Our problem where you and I live, the Christianity that you and I experience, is that we have
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:11.840]   a tendency to drift, to forget, to marginalize Christ where we see him sprinkled in various
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:19.080]   places in our life, where we call him Lord, but the Lordship is not practiced.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:25.440]   He is important, but not important enough to sacrifice everything.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:31.280]   We love him because of the good things he's given us, but we question him when things
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.360]   are no longer good.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.520]   Our idea of blessing from God is no different than the health and wealth gospel preachers.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:43.640]   We praise him for the goodness, we question him when trials and difficulty and illnesses
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.240]   come into our lives.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.720]   If you want to bear fruit, he says, you must abide in me.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:55.840]   John chapter 6, verse 56, Jesus says, "Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks of my blood abides
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.400]   in me and I in him."
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:02.240]   And it is in the present tense, meaning he who continues to feed, he who continues to
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:07.360]   drink of my blood, he will be mine, he abides in me.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:12.240]   It is not enough that years ago that your sins were justified.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:17.240]   The church is filled with people who claim justification at some point in their life
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:21.200]   and is no longer connected to Christ.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.840]   I'm not sure what trials and difficulties and anxieties that you live with on a day-to-day
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:33.880]   basis, but if you're not abiding in Christ, that's your biggest problem.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:43.040]   Not your marriage, not your children, not your job, not your health.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:51.040]   Even if cancer has been diagnosed and you may only have a few years to live, your biggest
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:57.240]   problem if you're not abiding in Christ is that, because Jesus is the resurrection and
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.040]   the life.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.420]   He is the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.160]   He is the vine.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.680]   He is the bread.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.760]   He is the living water.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.140]   He is the light.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.160]   He is the good shepherd.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.260]   He is the door.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.600]   He is.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:20.920]   He who comes to God must first believe that he is, and he is a rewarder of those who diligently
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.880]   seek him.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   Everything about who we are and why we are gathered together is to come to Christ.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.400]   This is why he was crucified on the cross.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.920]   This is why he established the church.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.800]   This is why we have fellowship.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:44.880]   This is why we go to India and China and wherever else he calls us to.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:51.280]   As a pastor of Bering Community Church, my ultimate goal is not to get you to India.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.280]   My ultimate goal is not to get you to China.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.680]   My ultimate goal is not to get you to your neighbors either.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:08.080]   My ultimate goal is to see Christ in you, that every single one of you would see the
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:16.840]   glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ and fall so deeply in love with him that this love
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.840]   will compel you to India.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:24.360]   It will compel you to your neighbors, to China.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.880]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:35.480]   I pray with all my heart that we would come to this conviction that no matter what we
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:41.720]   sacrifice that it wouldn't seem like sacrifice in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.720]   Jesus Christ our Lord.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.720]   Amen.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.120]   Let's have the praise team come up.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:54.800]   Let's take some time again to pray and to invite the Lord genuinely.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:01.520]   Invite the Lord genuinely into our lives.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:09.840]   Maybe you have been justified, assuming that you are all Christians.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:16.820]   But when you examine your life, can you honestly confess that Jesus is your life?
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:22.080]   Can you honestly confess that he is the way, the truth, and the life, and that is what
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.840]   other people see in you, that I don't understand you outside of the gospel message of Jesus
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840]   Christ?
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:34.360]   Let's take some time to pray before God that Christ, the true Christ of the scriptures
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360]   may be established in us.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.640]   So let's take time to pray as our worship team leads us.
