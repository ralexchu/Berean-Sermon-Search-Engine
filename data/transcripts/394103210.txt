[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   Okay, everyone.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   Hope you guys had a good time of discussion.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.320]   Let's bring our attention up here to the front.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.760]   We will take a moment to pray and then jump into our study.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.720]   745.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.960]   Okay, let's pray together.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:36.520]   Our God, we truly want to have our minds filled with your truth so that, Father God, we may
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.120]   be filled, Father Lord, with your love.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.720]   God, as we have been studying so far your scripture in the book of Ephesians, God, we
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.000]   can see, Lord, just how incredibly rich and deep your love is.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.040]   And I pray, Father God, that in our hearts and our souls, there would be such an appreciation.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.200]   Lord, I pray, Father God, that we would exercise our faith particularly here so that, God,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.080]   we can experience just the incredible joy that comes from seeing, Lord, your work towards
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.680]   us, the incredible confidence and hope from seeing, Father God, what you have secured
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.160]   for us in Christ.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.960]   Lord, would you be with us tonight as we continue to study?
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.280]   We do ask for your Spirit's leading and conviction.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   We ask for eyes open to observe, to ask, and to continue learning, Lord.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.760]   We thank you it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.760]   Amen.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.840]   Okay, so let's begin with review.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.040]   It's always good to just follow the trail of thought from Apostle Paul as he is teaching
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.680]   this amazing theology, the amazing truth, just the amazing kind of praise of God and
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.280]   his work and love towards us.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.760]   So remember that in the first, you can just think of the first half, chapter one, rather
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.800]   than thinking through like, "Oh, which verse?"
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.740]   Just think, okay, chapter, chapter, chapter, first half of chapter one, the overwhelming
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.480]   spiritual blessings of God in Christ, okay?
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.600]   Remember that there was such an emphasis of all cross time, across like the, just the
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.680]   spectrum of the way that God has loved us.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.720]   It was all according to his purposes.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.040]   It was all in Christ and it was to his praise, okay?
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.640]   Now I have a bunch of blanks for you guys and stuff like that on there.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.480]   Just go ahead and jot those down just for your retention's sake.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.720]   Second half of chapter one, remember Apostle Paul says, "So if there is this massive blessing
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.000]   that exists in Christ and I hear of your faith in it, I'm so overjoyed."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.680]   So he's thankful and then he prays.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.840]   He prays that every single person would have their eyes open and enlightened to know what
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.800]   is the hope, the riches, and the greatness of his power, okay?
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.160]   The greatness of his power.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.640]   Now from there, remember that those things are things that we could have just camped
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.720]   out on, but very specifically, Apostle Paul focuses on the power of God and begins to
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   extrapolate.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.560]   He begins to unpack, see the power of God that has placed Christ far above, and there
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.800]   was a lot of lists of various things that he did.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.480]   And then, so that's chapter one.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.480]   Chapter two, what we studied last time, first half, right?
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.440]   First half, essentially verses one through 10, you could almost see it as, and there
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.200]   is then this great, magnificent display of the power of God and the gospel.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.440]   Ultimately, if you summarize it, it takes you dead and made alive with Christ, right?
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.800]   And so we began by saying, "Though you were dead, you were dead in your sins and your
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.160]   trespasses."
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.640]   And we described how that deadness displays itself in multiple ways.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.480]   We described how, I said, one of the focal points of this too was that just like a dirty
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.120]   sock puppet with the hand of Satan in it, you are like a lifeless being under the control
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.520]   of the world, Satan, and your flesh.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.920]   Really incredibly bleak scenario.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.840]   And I tried to give you that visual of a dead man, not just on the floor, but on the floor
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.760]   inside of a jail cell with many other dead people throughout the generations of time,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   right?
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.080]   So if you guys recall that picture I gave you guys, the scripture is teaching us about
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.240]   the state of affairs prior to knowing God, okay?
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.280]   And then in verses four through five, oops, I think I have an error there.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.600]   Chapter two, verses four through five, he says there's a great transition of the but,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.200]   but God made us alive, and the context of that is all of God and his rich mercy, of
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.400]   his love, his great love, and then though we were dead in the transgressions, okay?
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.080]   So today, let's take a moment to read our passage.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.920]   We're moving forward from that review to this section of scripture, and I'll read it for
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   us.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.720]   It says, "But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us,
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.400]   even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ by grace
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.560]   you have been saved, and raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.800]   places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come he might show the surpassing riches
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.600]   of his grace and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.280]   For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.280]   It is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.360]   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.960]   so that we would walk in them."
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.340]   Okay.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.360]   So that's our passage, and as you guys know, that passage from in chapter 2, verses 1 through
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.040]   10, is such an amazing summary of the gospel that we have received, right?
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.440]   If you're walking a non-Christian through the scriptures in order to share with them
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.880]   the gospel, that is one primary portion to show.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.680]   The incredible before and after.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.960]   The incredible, this is you prior to Christ without the Lord in your life.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.440]   This is you in Christ, okay?
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.400]   Now let's begin by going to the very first section, verses 4 through 6, okay, verses
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.240]   4 through 6, and make some observations.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.280]   We begin with the question that I asked as a suggested study question, which is, observe
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.860]   and re-observe what is the work of God towards us, right?
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.400]   This passage and the passage before continue to talk about this is God's kindness towards
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.160]   you, this is his work towards you, well what is it?
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.480]   And what we notice is the three terms here highlighted, that he made us alive together
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.400]   with Christ, he raised us up with him, and he seated us up with Christ, okay?
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.620]   Now when you think about this then, you have to start making, start asking questions.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.320]   These three terms, is there a sequence?
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.960]   Is there any kind of relationship between those terms, right?
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.720]   And I'm pretty sure a lot of you guys perhaps kind of just felt the growing grace through
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:26.280]   it, okay, meaning there is kind of this like growing magnitude of what God is doing on
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   our behalf, to bring us alive with Christ, to raise us up, and then to seat us, right?
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.720]   There's this like rising element to that, and that's totally legitimate, totally good
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.760]   for us to think about, just to imagine like, you take an individual who previously was,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.440]   again I use that term, a dirty sock puppet that's lifeless, and then you place this
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.760]   individual onto a seat of honor.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.240]   You place this individual in a seat of power.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   You place this individual in a seat of authority.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.480]   That is incredible, right?
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.840]   Now for the sake of time, we can sit there and kind of meditate on that for a little
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.520]   bit, but what I want to contrast is, previously, Apostle Paul in the description of our deadness,
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.040]   he talked about actually the lowering that we had.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.880]   Meaning, previously, he described us by saying we were dead, and then you were oppressed,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880]   and then you were just indulging.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:28.440]   You've been basically existing, rolling around in the mud, right, following your lusts.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.320]   And then to contrast that by saying, and that he made you alive, he raised you, and then
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   he seated you.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.000]   What an amazing, amazing work of God.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.760]   Now another thing that we want to observe, we observe that some of these terms are actually,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.800]   if you look at all these terms, it's like past tense.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.120]   But there's something strange about that, right?
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:56.600]   You observe that being seated, like with him in the heavenlies, that's for future, isn't
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   it?
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.480]   Isn't that glorification?
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.600]   Something that's coming our way?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.640]   But instead, it's talked about as in the past tense.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.720]   Now when you think about this, as a matter of fact, there's a lot of scripture, there's
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.200]   a lot of things that we know that when we start thinking about sequence of time, it's
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.080]   kind of difficult to understand.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.200]   But there's something for us to really glean from all that, which is this.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.720]   The way that God is perceiving his work towards us is not just simply sequence of operation,
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.880]   is it?
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.480]   We're talking about spiritual realities that are true for us.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.960]   We're talking about spiritual realities that are true for us.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.280]   What am I saying?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.560]   That in God's perspective, his work is already finished.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:49.160]   In God's perspective, God's masterful plan, in God's perspective, the things that he has
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.320]   laid out, he has laid out already set in the distant past.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.000]   He said before the foundation of the world.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.280]   And the way that he thinks of it, it's good as done.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.600]   For us then, there can be this weird misconception that because we live in such kind of like
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.360]   a linear timeline, we're thinking, okay, we're justified, we're sanctified, and then we're
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.960]   glorified, and this needs to happen, and then that needs to happen, and we like to cut it
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.560]   clean.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:22.360]   But actually when you think about it, including our sanctification, including our glorification,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.880]   there is a sense to the already, these are spiritual realities that you possess.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.240]   Have you ever thought about this?
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.480]   Scripture says that if anybody is in Christ, he is a new man.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.800]   Well, then therefore, the glorification, the sanctification that we're supposed to be progressively
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.600]   working on, those things are conceived to be already yours to some degree, right?
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.120]   So there's what I'm saying is an already, and also a not yet.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.560]   What am I saying that we should glean from this?
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:00.440]   Is man, when we think about appreciating God's work for us, take some time to meditate on
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.560]   that.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:08.680]   For us, when we think about reasons to really worship, for us, when we're thinking about
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.960]   reasons to really praise, there should be in our hearts this overwhelming feeling of
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.320]   like, oh my goodness, I have already been blessed, right?
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.120]   I've already been blessed.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.160]   It isn't that the way pretty much that the whole book began, blessed be God, the Father
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.080]   of our Lord Jesus Christ, who's blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080]   places.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.000]   But then there's a question for you and me.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.520]   Are we experiencing, even in the sentiment, that kind of blessedness?
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:46.680]   Are we experiencing this kind of the spiritual realities are already yours?
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.800]   This kind of the riches of the glories of God are already yours?
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.340]   And that's a question and challenge for us.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.600]   Now I want to make a third observation within this, when there's this, within this section
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:05.240]   about the saving work of God, which is, if we notice one of the highlights of this section
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:12.960]   is a repeated idea, again, that all these works of God are to us in Christ.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.360]   Okay?
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.940]   So first was thinking through God has made us alive, raised us and seated us.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:27.200]   Second is working through the idea that there is an already accomplished tense to the blessings
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.880]   of God, and then this third part is that is all in the union with Christ.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.880]   Okay?
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.600]   The third observation for you is this is all in our union with Christ.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.120]   Please take some time to just meditate on this truth.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.960]   Again, I'm going to use that term quite a bit that we need to meditate on these truths
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.280]   because the first three chapters of Ephesians is all about us understanding and knowing
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.200]   the truths that God has for us.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:02.600]   But take some time to think about this, this amazing, perfect union that we have with Christ.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.000]   This is to us our salvation.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.160]   This is to us our completeness.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.880]   This is everything to us.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:15.120]   All the blessings that we have is in Christ.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.360]   Meditate with me on this kind of strange and weird statement.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.640]   Whatever is true of Christ is true of you for salvation.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.480]   Okay?
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.980]   If I say whatever is true of Christ is true of you, automatically we should be feeling
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.640]   a little bit uncomfortable because Christ is so far beyond us.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.200]   He transcends us.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.940]   His holiness is perfect.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.200]   His knowledge is perfect.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.100]   His righteousness is perfect.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.480]   Everything about him is perfect.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.860]   And so for us to say what is true of Christ is true of you, automatically that should
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.960]   make us feel uneasy, and rightly so.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.120]   Why?
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.120]   Because he is before us, he is far above and beyond us, and we are absolutely unworthy
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.780]   of him.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.880]   That is a truth.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.440]   But think about this.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:13.500]   To us in our salvation, the only way we were saved is to be saved in the person of Christ.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:20.600]   There is a spiritual, miraculous, almost indescribable power of God exercised where you're united
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.800]   with him.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.760]   And therefore, because Christ died, you die.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.020]   Because Christ has suffered, you have suffered.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.720]   Because he rose, you rose.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.180]   Because he pleases God, when God looks upon you, you please him.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.180]   Because Christ is glorified, so are you.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.480]   And I want you to think about that.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.780]   You know, in our table we were just kind of thinking about how this is effective in the
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.460]   gospel.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.400]   Let's take a moment just to meditate upon the ramifications of how we even describe
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.820]   the gospel in certain scenarios.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:03.540]   One, because of recent talks of the corruptions of different religions and cults or whatever
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:09.740]   it may be, because there's constant like talks of like, let's say, even pedophilia within
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.940]   Catholicism or whatever it may be.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.140]   There's lots of talks about the horrendous sins that even like, you know, religious people
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.140]   do.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.140]   Okay.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.300]   Now within that, there's this question.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.060]   And God saves those people too?
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.940]   Well, think about this.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.100]   When we talk about the gospel, we are talking about not just kind of sinners, we're talking
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.340]   about worst of sinners.
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.780]   So we should be imagining the worst scenario possible.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.380]   And what is that?
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:43.300]   If you take an individual who is a repeat offending pedophile, right?
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.120]   Which is like the worst, the absolute worst.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:54.060]   To our human logic, that individual needs to pay.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.500]   Is the Christian gospel for that individual?
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.860]   And our answer is yes.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.180]   How so?
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.860]   Because that individual in his payment, if he places faith on Christ, guess what?
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.340]   He's going to pay to the full.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.340]   Why?
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.020]   Because he's going to suffer and die just like Christ suffered and died.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.180]   The sacrifice of Christ is true for him.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.820]   He died.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:24.100]   He needs the worst, the greatest horrible pain and punishment possibly inflicted.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.380]   If he places faith on Christ, it's going to be true.
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.740]   The crucifixion is going to be true.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.740]   Why?
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.220]   Because any man who places faith on Christ has died with him.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.620]   Yes?
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.620]   Think about that.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.100]   It's pretty crazy to think about that in our union with Christ, then we are truly afforded
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.100]   everything.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.460]   We're truly afforded everything.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.980]   And that's why this whole series, in our study through the book of Ephesians, that's why
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:58.460]   I entitled it "Every Blessing in Christ," because it's such an emphatic point of the
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.220]   entire book.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.100]   Now let's move on.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.100]   Let's move on.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.100]   Okay?
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.060]   Point two, or section two.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:13.420]   In section two, one of the questions that I asked was, "What is the main objective or
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.740]   goal that God has displayed in this passage?"
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.220]   The grand purpose of salvation is another way to put it.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.860]   And what we see is, he says, "So that in the ages to come, he might show the surpassing
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:32.260]   riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus."
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.420]   Okay?
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:38.540]   Let's take a moment to really just kind of put a stake down and just meditate on that
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.060]   for a little bit, right?
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:47.660]   He just says very clearly, "So that," this is the purpose, "that in the ages to come,
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.880]   he might show the surpassing riches of his grace."
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.860]   If we were to put it into our own words, we can summarize that by saying that God is going
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.340]   to be glorified for his incredible love, right?
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:06.500]   For his rich mercy, for his kindness, for the love that he lavished upon us.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.740]   The goal of God is the glory of God.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.740]   That's it.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.100]   And it doesn't take a genius to extrapolate that from the passage.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:22.920]   And so immediately, our question should be, if this is the goal of God, is this your goal?
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:29.320]   If this is the purpose of God in his working and might, is this your ambition?
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.800]   Because truthfully speaking, this right here, in terms of glorifying God for his incredible
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:41.720]   salvation which exhibits his incredible sacrificial love, this is to us the foundation.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.200]   This is to us the deep well from which we do everything.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.340]   This is to us the great treasure.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.180]   This is to us the incredible riches.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.540]   This is to us our everything.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:59.620]   And the fact of the matter is, if, if for us, we lose sight of the incredible, glorious,
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:06.100]   surpassing mercies of God, if I don't have a stirring appreciation for the rich, rich,
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.180]   lavishing love of Christ, then I'm completely missing it.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.180]   I missed the train.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.820]   I don't understand why people are in a hurry to go.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.500]   I don't understand why people are in a hurry to come to worship.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.780]   I don't understand why people are doing anything.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.980]   I missed the whole thing.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.620]   Now I want to share with you a thought.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.380]   The pastors, we had like a, we had lunch on Tuesday and we were just kind of ruminating
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.280]   about this passage.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:38.580]   And we were thinking, if an individual in his first step, foundation, in his first primary
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:47.260]   heart condition, if he does not love and see the glory of God's grace towards us, then
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.420]   to love even the church is a most dangerous thing.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.020]   I'm going to repeat that.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.820]   To our community, one of the most dangerous people is not the guy going, "Hey, let's go
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.420]   worship something else," right?
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.740]   "Hey, believe in this false theology."
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.980]   One of the most dangerous things that can happen to our church is somebody who literally
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.380]   just loves the church as their everything.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.180]   This is their thing.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.420]   They love church, but they don't primarily have a love for Christ.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.420]   Why?
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.660]   Because that means if our Lord Jesus Christ takes our church a different direction, if
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.420]   that means the church is growing and changing, if that means the church is growing and moving
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.540]   without that person, guess what that person is going to do?
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.460]   Out of their so-called love for the church, they're going to resist Christ's leading.
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.740]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.700]   Out of their dedication, "No, the church has to stay the same.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.100]   I love this thing."
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.300]   They could literally be at odds with the purposes of Christ.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.060]   Another way to think about it is the most dangerous person is a person who loves theology,
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.660]   knowledge, and scripture with no idea of what it means to appreciate the love of Christ.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.740]   Why?
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.260]   Because then every time they are learning and every time they're gaining in knowledge,
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.020]   it goes into the wrong bucket.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.140]   Why are you doing that?
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.980]   Why are you doing that?
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.940]   It goes into the bucket of their own accolades, their pride.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.380]   It goes into the bucket or their waist belt of weapons to use against people.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.380]   "What are you doing?
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.180]   What are you doing?"
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:27.740]   That's what happens when you do not have the first and foremost sight to see the riches
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.260]   of the grace of God.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:37.940]   To us, our primary ambition should be the primary goal God has said is why he saves.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.740]   It's for his own glory.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.900]   It's for his own glory.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.380]   I want to highlight a passage to you.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:50.420]   This passage comes from Isaiah 48, verses 9 through 11.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:56.260]   God says this, "For my name's sake, I defer my anger.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.180]   For the sake of my praise, I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.220]   Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.100]   I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.140]   For my own sake, I do it.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.820]   For how should my name be profaned?
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.140]   My glory I will not give to another."
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.780]   That repetition you find in this passage, I did not add it for emphasis.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.300]   Those are God's word.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.580]   God acts in accordance with his glory, and therefore, ultimately, the incredible salvation
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.260]   that we see is not just because.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.180]   It's for his glory.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.100]   And so that to us has to be our great, great ambition.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.540]   Now, moving forward to the next section, in section three, the logic then of God's glory.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.540]   Why do I say that?
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:53.380]   It's because when you observe this passage, notice how he has various statements that
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.620]   says, "So that," and then you have your purpose, right?
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.140]   You have your purpose.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.900]   But then the passage begins to continue to flow, where in verse eight, he begins with
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:09.300]   the preposition "for," and then verse 10 also has that same term, "for."
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.180]   Which means what I'm saying is that grand purpose statement of God, that he might show
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:18.820]   his surpassing riches, is supported, or at least explained, right?
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.500]   Supported or explained and extrapolated by those two thoughts.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.220]   One, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.500]   gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.100]   Verse 10, "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.260]   prepared beforehand, so that we would walk in them."
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.260]   So think about this.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.500]   If I were to summarize that, I would summarize it like this.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:51.340]   The great purpose of God and the objective of God is for his glory, right?
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:56.140]   And what shows his glory is the believers understanding the grace of God and appreciating
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:01.100]   the grace of God, but what's more fulfilling, the work of God in us.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.700]   Let me explain.
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.140]   First section.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:11.420]   In that first section, we have to understand the logic that God's grace, God's grace reveals
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.900]   his great glory.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:21.140]   But oftentimes, what stands against that great glory is our pride.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:28.140]   Where in our human eye, we want to see cause and effect, and the cause being us.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:34.740]   You recall the disciples regularly struggling with this desire that as God, like in Christ,
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.740]   as God is doing his work, as Christ is doing his work, they constantly want a piece of
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.460]   it, right?
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.640]   If you're gonna be exalted, can I sit there?
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.160]   If you're gonna be exalted, can I sit on the right side, right?
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.020]   If he's doing his work, it's like, which one's greater though, me or him, right?
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:57.340]   There's always this constant vying for some kind of merit, right?
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:04.340]   But what we have to conclude is, as you do that, you are not glorifying God.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.340]   Take a look at how emphatic this little section of scripture is.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:16.900]   To see the emphasis, what we see here is two repetitions of describing what it is and what
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.900]   is not.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:23.020]   He says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves."
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.300]   It is the gift of God, not as a result of work.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.920]   The reason why I say that's emphatic is because for us, every time we're trying to give, let's
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.540]   say something like instruction, the way that we make sure something is emphatic is by telling,
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:39.720]   "Hey, this is what it is, but also this is what it's not."
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:45.180]   If I were to tell you guys, "Hey guys, I want you guys to get under your tables."
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.500]   In order to make it emphatic, I say, "This is not a drill, right?
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.580]   There's an earthquake right now."
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:55.220]   Likewise, in this passage, the Apostle Paul gives both, "This is what it is.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.320]   You have been saved by grace and this is what it's not.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.060]   This is not of yourselves and not as a result of works."
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.660]   And what's more, think about how emphatic this is.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.140]   There is another "so that."
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:16.380]   God as a design of His purpose, by the will of His power, as He has deemed it, no man
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.020]   is going to boast before Him.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.820]   And what that makes me think about is the future.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.180]   You guys, if you guys read Revelation, think about the future and the scenes that are to
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.180]   come.
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:35.380]   What we're going to see in the book of Revelation is like incredibly epic scenes.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:42.340]   Like these are cosmic scenes where the host of the world, every single person imaginable
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.260]   is going to bow the knee at Christ.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:50.740]   And what's going to happen is like signifying figures, rulers, those with crowns are going
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.660]   to rise up and they're going to sing.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.060]   And you recall what they're going to sing.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:01.420]   They're going to sing, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power, riches, wisdom,
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.700]   strength, honor, glory, and blessing."
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.060]   And they're going to keep crying out without end, "To Him who sits on the throne to be
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:15.860]   praise, honor, glory, power forever and ever, amen."
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:20.460]   And not a single individual is going to sit there and be like, "Yeah, we did it!"
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.620]   That's just not going to happen.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.620]   This was no joint effort to save mankind.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.900]   Why do I bring this up?
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:34.180]   It's because I want us to really be reflective of that section.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:39.780]   We're talking about the glory of God and the understanding for us that our salvation is
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:47.420]   truly and purely of God that is directly tied to us giving Him glory.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.820]   But for generations and generations, whether it be church history, whether it be you in
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.820]   your own life, we grapple and we struggle, right?
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.900]   We struggle within ourselves to truly understand that our salvation is by grace and a gift
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.100]   to you, right?
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.240]   Something innate within us almost reacts like, "It doesn't make sense.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.020]   How could it be just so free?
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:20.100]   How could it be that all I have to do truly is to trust and to receive?"
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.700]   And what that does is it challenges us.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:26.100]   You have to start thinking the whole context of everything He said is because you were
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:32.100]   truly dead, is because you were truly wretched, is because this chasm that existed between
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.740]   you and God was unfathomable.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.260]   And you are absolutely incapable of doing anything else.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.700]   It is by faith alone.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:47.300]   And on the flip side of that, He says this.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:56.620]   Okay, let me go to this part right here, the workmanship, right?
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.620]   The second part of that is this.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:04.260]   If we're talking about the glory of God, okay, and the first portion of it is the grace
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:10.460]   of God that reveals, okay, and the second part of it, He says, "For we are His workmanship
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:16.540]   created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.540]   in them."
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.740]   Now, there's a couple things to understand and highlight here, so let's walk through
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.620]   it together, and then we'll begin to start wrapping things up.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:32.100]   Here, in this second portion that supports God's purpose of showing and revealing His
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:38.060]   glory and His surpassing mercies, He says that we are His workmanship.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:43.100]   So us being the handy work of God glorifies the Lord.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.780]   Now, some people might say some things like, "You are a masterpiece of God."
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.660]   I think that's saying a little too much.
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.700]   For those of you guys who did word study on that, good.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.060]   It just means it's a fruit.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.220]   It's a product of your work, okay?
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.640]   But think about this.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.260]   We are, then, the handy work of God.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.660]   That alone suffices.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.100]   God doesn't have to make masterpieces.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.580]   Why?
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.980]   Because what God makes, He perfects.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.380]   Now, think about this.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:20.100]   There is a group of people who we've labeled free grace theologians, okay?
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   Free grace theologians.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.500]   I've mentioned them before in other contexts of preaching.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:32.780]   Free grace theologians denounce lordship salvation because they believe if grace is free, all
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.580]   I have to do is verbally accept it, and we're done.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.440]   For you to expect of me to either bear fruit or show evidence is heresy.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.660]   To call for change of life is to lay a burden on the saint.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:52.860]   If I have claimed faith, God's grace is so free, even if you walk away for miles or for
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.620]   decades, you are saved no matter what.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.380]   So free grace theologians believe you can be apostate for some time, but eventually
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:07.320]   you'll come back, and God's grace should not be doubted.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.700]   This passage right here, verse 10, absolutely contradicts all of that.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.700]   Why?
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:19.420]   Because the scripture is saying the glory of God is revealed in His workmanship, which
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.200]   is you.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.100]   So if a free grace theologian was before me, you know what I would say?
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:34.540]   I would say stop meddling in all the technicalities of your free gift, but glorify God.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.500]   You need to glorify God.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.960]   That's the point.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.900]   To say to the Lord that maybe, maybe I'll change.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:49.060]   To say to the Lord in a certain manner, sure, I received the grace, but I don't have to
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.700]   actually change.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.000]   We have to ask the question, is that actually the purpose of God?
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.820]   Is that actually the goal of God?
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.500]   Is that what God was trying to accomplish?
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.820]   No, it is not.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:07.820]   It is an amazing mercy and love for you that God is changing you.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:13.860]   It is His absolute care and grace to you that God is transforming you so that you don't
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:19.660]   just say with words, but rather you are transformed in life.
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:26.220]   And for you to think that you don't have to change, that means you don't get it.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.140]   That means you don't get all the stuff we're talking about, about previous sins.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.540]   That means you don't get the incredible work of God.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.020]   That means you don't get the incredible purpose of God.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.020]   You don't see God.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.140]   Rather it's kind of like this.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.540]   Remember this scene?
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.300]   A man dead in the cage.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:51.900]   That man can say, "Hey, but I said thank you and amen every time before a meal."
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.260]   Technically he praised God.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.180]   Technically he thanked the Lord.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.740]   Technically he said stuff that every good Christian should say.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.220]   But does that mean salvation?
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.100]   What am I saying?
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:15.180]   For us, we have to understand that the work of God in us to transform our lives, that
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:20.500]   is supposed to be supporting His amazing love and His amazing grace.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:28.420]   And for us to think that that's somehow, that's somehow either optional, how dare you, right?
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.680]   That is absolute arrogance.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.980]   That is absolute arrogance.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:40.180]   Now as a way to kind of start wrapping things up, you know that age old song that like,
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.100]   "He's changing me, my precious Jesus.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.060]   I'm not the same person that I used to be."
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.060]   That's a good song.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:54.580]   And as a matter of fact, if we just stop the moment right there, we should be able to say,
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.540]   "And thank you, Lord, that I'm not the same person.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.660]   That's your grace for me.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.460]   Why in the world would I even want to be the same person?
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:11.020]   If I knew who I was, controlled by dark forces, if I knew who I was in the wretchedness of
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:16.560]   my state, why in the world would I volitionally choose not to change?"
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.420]   It just goes to show that we don't understand.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:29.660]   So by way of conclusion and wrapping things up, are we meditating and blessing the Lord?
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:38.020]   If God's incredible objective and goal is the showing of the surpassing of his grace,
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.180]   are we doing that to the degree where we're blessing God because we see it?
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:48.340]   If Apostle Paul's prayer was that our eyes would be open and enlightened to see the knowledge
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:54.060]   of him, to see the incredible calling, to see the riches of his glory, to see the inheritance
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:59.100]   and the blessings, are you meditating on that and seeing it?
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.620]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:06.020]   Have you thought about the incredible kindness of God and appreciated the breadth of the
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.260]   timing of it all?
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:15.900]   So far, Apostle Paul has been talking about a kind of thoughtfulness of God that's stretched
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.460]   beyond even the time that we know, time itself.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.340]   We've been inundated with the fact that God is so intentional in his kindness.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.660]   We've been shown that the extent of his kindness goes to things that are even incomprehensible
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.300]   or even doesn't even make sense.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:36.020]   Why would you honor something that was so decaying and dead?
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.980]   Why would you even raise him up?
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.820]   We saw the backdrop of his kindness.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.540]   We saw the intensity of his kindness.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.360]   We saw the certainty of his kindness.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.500]   We saw the glory of his kindness.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.560]   And we can go on even more.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.640]   The first several chapters of Ephesians is for you to dwell and meditate on the riches
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.980]   of Christ.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.560]   And that is where at the heart of what we're trying to do, at the heart of what we're trying
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.580]   to say, that is powerful faith.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.780]   When you start to see, when your eyes are open and you are enlightened, and once you
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:16.060]   see and you're just gripped by it, then you've caught on.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.060]   Then you're on board.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.700]   Then you get it.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:29.200]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:36.860]   Heavenly Father, this passage of your scripture is so rich.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:44.500]   And God, you've shown us, Lord, that your work towards us is glorious.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:50.760]   Now for us in a brief 30, 40 minutes to appreciate the glory of your riches, the riches of your
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:56.080]   mercy, Lord God, we recognize it's just a quick snapshot.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.000]   But I do pray, Father God, along with your scriptures, that every single one of us would
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.080]   know the meaning and to see from different angles and to experience at different moments,
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.440]   Lord, your mercy in our lives.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:15.340]   I pray, Father God, that what grips every single one of us by faith would be your incredible
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:20.680]   holiness and your incredible love, that God, that's the thing we're attracted to.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.900]   And Lord, I do pray, Father God, that there are so many things working against us to try
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:31.480]   to veil your glory, to try to keep us far, to try to keep us distracted.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.900]   But I ask that you'd give us strength so that we could fight against all of those things
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.440]   in our lives.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:41.500]   And God, that our great, great ambition is to know you and your love more.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.720]   Lord, we want to thank you and just pray that as we reflect and discuss, you would help
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.420]   us to continue to have that eagerness to grow and learn, but what's more, just to really
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.820]   edify each other in this faith.
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.820]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.320]   Amen.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:04.280]   [ Silence ]
