[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880]   Okay, well, welcome to our Good Friday service once again.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.600]   My name is Nathan.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.480]   And this is actually more and more as I've been walking with Christ.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.480]   Growing up, Easter and Passion Week wasn't that big of a deal.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.920]   It wasn't something that we especially celebrated.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.880]   And what's been interesting is, man, I've grown to appreciate Easter so much, where
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.680]   I think it's slowly becoming one of my favorite holidays.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.360]   Which is very strange, you know, because how do you displace Christmas?
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.200]   But what I realized is, especially walking through the Passion Week over the last few
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.880]   years here at Berean together with all of you, is that we are able to walk the steps
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.040]   of Christ, all the way to the cross, and eventually celebrate the resurrection of Christ on Sunday.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.080]   I think it's a holiday that is possibly one of the, like, maybe the freer of distractions
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.240]   from all the other holidays.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.880]   I think we have an opportunity every year at this time to celebrate something that is
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.800]   so strange for the world if we tell them what we're celebrating, the death of the one that
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.760]   we proclaim to be our King.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.280]   And tonight, Good Friday, and we've said this many, many times in the past before,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.400]   man, why would we call it good?
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.360]   Why would we call something like this something to be celebrated?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.040]   What are we doing here, gathering together, taking time to think about his death?
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.880]   Shouldn't we be people who think about the resurrection?
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.680]   Shouldn't we be people who consider that to be the pinnacle of everything?
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.280]   What is it about the death that is so important that we would gather here on some random Friday
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.680]   night to take a whole week to lead up to this time when Jesus finally is killed?
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.840]   All week we've been doing this.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.400]   We've been going down this path that Jesus walked, to crucifixion.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.640]   We've been saying day after day that every step was intentional, that everything he was
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.000]   doing was volitional, that he was making choices and decisions.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.960]   No one had a gun to his head to force him down this path.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.200]   Jesus was doing it because he wanted to.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.880]   And we know that Jesus was innocent.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.760]   He was the only one in history to have never sinned.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   Consider that.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.080]   Take a moment to really think about that.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.760]   He was the only person in history to have never sinned.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.080]   We're talking about a flawless person.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   He never lusted.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.920]   He was never slothful.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.640]   He was perfect in righteous anger.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.920]   He loved everyone he came across.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.280]   Again, take a moment to think about that.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.880]   He loved every person.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.160]   This wasn't just a restraint of sin in his life.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.260]   This was who he was.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.920]   If out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks, then the taming of the tongue isn't
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.200]   going to be the thing that changes whether we're sinning or not, right?
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.080]   It's from where it flows.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   It's the heart.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.760]   Jesus' heart was sinless.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.720]   See when we visit that age-old question, and I think it's healthy, it's healthy to think
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.920]   about that every once in a while, which is if you're to die tonight, if you came face
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.360]   to face with the creator, with the God who made you, regardless of who you are right
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   now, right?
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.880]   All of us, one day, if we were to die tonight and we came face to face with the God who
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:28.760]   created me, who made me, and he judged you upon a good standard, a righteous standard,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:37.360]   what would be the only way for you to be allowed entrance into the kingdom of God?
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.280]   It's perfection.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.040]   It's zero sin.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.680]   You have to be flawless.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.400]   It's not just the controlling of the tongue, it's the heart.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.320]   It's not just a restraint of sinful activity, it's who you are.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.440]   You have to be perfect.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.120]   Meaning this, Jesus alone would be able to fulfill the standard to enter into the kingdom
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.800]   of God, right?
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.340]   That's a logical conclusion.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.380]   There was only one person in all of history ever to be sinless, flawless, and without
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.980]   any blame, wholly righteous, and that's Jesus.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.360]   He is then the only one who should be able to enter into the kingdom of God, which leaves
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.900]   us at a conundrum, at a very fascinating place.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.940]   Who is in heaven now?
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.380]   Who will be in heaven in the times to come?
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.780]   The answer is, besides Christ, no one else should be in heaven, right?
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.060]   If that is the standard, and Jesus is the only one, then no one should be allowed entrance
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.620]   into the kingdom of God ever.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.820]   Heaven ought to be empty.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.100]   That's the logical thing.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:11.600]   The only way that God could remain a good God, a just God, perfect in his standards,
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:20.100]   and upholding his righteousness, would be an empty heaven.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.860]   Hell should house every single one of us.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.340]   Every single one.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.860]   Every single human.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.700]   The Bible is clear, it says this in Romans chapter 3 verse 10, "There is none righteous,
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   not even one."
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.860]   I love that.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.320]   Not even one.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.300]   Not a single person who is pure.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.860]   Good intentions are not enough.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.380]   Morally doing more good than evil is not enough, because it's not only what you do, but it's
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.460]   who you are.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.940]   We are sinners.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.820]   We are objects of God's wrath.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.180]   We are born rebelling against God.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.060]   We hate God.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.900]   We are insolent.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.980]   We're arrogant, altogether filthy, which leads us to the next obvious conclusion, which comes
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.340]   in Romans 3, 23, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.020]   We fall short of his glory.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.640]   We fall short of his standard.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.380]   We fall short of the person of who he is.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.620]   We fall short of heaven's door.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.980]   In fact, it's not only that we are denied entrance into heaven, but Romans 6, 23, it
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.380]   goes further to say, "For the wages of sin is death."
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.740]   It's not only that we are not allowed entrance into the kingdom of God, but what that means
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.220]   is that this is certain death for us.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.220]   It's not death.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:56.740]   Death would be nice if I was annihilated, but this is eternal death.
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:02.060]   There's a problem we're left with here.
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:10.860]   You see, there should have been a sure, swift, and immediate death for all of us.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:19.980]   There should be no hope of heaven for any of us.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.180]   The problem is there shouldn't be eventual death.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.200]   There shouldn't be a delayed death.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:32.120]   As soon as we exist, we should be eternally dead.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.220]   We should fall under his eternal wrath.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:43.420]   This is weird because I'm breathing.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.260]   There are seven and a half billion people breathing in this world.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:54.420]   Seven and a half billion hearts that are beating right now.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:05.060]   This is a problem because if God is good and just, how can we exist?
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:13.260]   There should be no space or opportunity for life because every breath I take as a sinner
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:19.620]   should be an outrage for God.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.780]   This is the only fair thing, but people continue to walk.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:30.380]   Our very existence ought to cause us to question God's goodness and justice.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:37.300]   The fact that any sinner walks around should not make any sense to us.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:45.460]   Just as if you were to see a raping, murderous, hateful, walking person free for even a single
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:51.260]   day, that should be like, "No, that should not be allowed to happen."
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:59.380]   That any of us are existing, are breathing, are living should be an outrage.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:08.060]   But God, he keeps saving, he keeps preserving, and the fingerprints of God's grace is found
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.020]   all over history from day one.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:17.340]   Some people see the God of the Old Testament as someone who is judging and wrathful and
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.340]   awful.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:26.820]   And to you, and sometimes, honestly, sometimes my heart questions.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:34.060]   So to my own heart, I ask this question, like, "Really?"
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.940]   The more I read scripture, the more I come to know who God is.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:47.380]   Did you know the Old Testament God, I find him to be absurdly gracious, incredibly, incredibly
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:53.300]   kind and patient.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:11:00.780]   Because again, every breath taken by a single human is God's sustaining, intentional gift
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:08.980]   of grace and mercy and love and kindness to us.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.060]   In the Old Testament, I'm going to take us through a few Bible passages here just to
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.060]   paint the picture.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:19.020]   In the Old Testament, we see that death, though it should have come immediately, doesn't come.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:24.020]   Look at Genesis 2, verse 16, "The Lord God commanded the man, saying, 'From any tree
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.660]   of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.020]   you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it, you will surely die.'"
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.820]   Again, this should leave us with the problem because it says, "In the day that you eat
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.780]   from that fruit," what will happen?
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.500]   You will surely die.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.820]   It even says surely.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.220]   It doesn't just say you will die.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.900]   It is certain to happen.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.540]   You will surely die.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.540]   But the problem is chapter 3 happens.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:12:00.340]   That's a big problem to God's goodness and justice and to his word.
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.340]   I mean, look what happens.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.020]   Genesis chapter 3, verse 6, "When the women saw that the tree was good for food," and
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.100]   here it is, she's walking up to this tree and to this fruit and says, "And it was a
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.280]   delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:21.640]   She took from its fruit, ate it, and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate it."
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.880]   They should be dead.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.160]   But it says, "Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked,
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.600]   and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings."
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.280]   You know what this is called?
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   This is called grace.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.840]   In Genesis chapter 4, verse 8, Cain, here's what it says, "Cain told Abel his brother,"
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.560]   I'm sure we all know this story, "and it came about when they were in the field that Cain
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   rose up against Abel his brother and killed him."
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.840]   Talk about sin spiral.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.200]   This is literally the next generation.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.880]   These are Adam and Eve's kids.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.000]   And murder happens.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It isn't a slow devolution.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.200]   It's immediately just murder.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.560]   Can you imagine that?
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   And you would think as soon as God sees Cain kill Abel, it's like, "Oh, that's it."
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.560]   Kaput, right?
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   That's it.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:19.480]   But it says in verse 15, "And the Lord appointed a sign for Cain so that no one finding him
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.080]   would slay him."
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:30.160]   I have no other explanation other than this is grace.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.680]   In Genesis chapter 6, verse 5, it says, "And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.240]   great on the earth."
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   It's huge.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.400]   This word "great," you have to use your exaggerated mind.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.840]   There's just rampant wickedness in the world.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:52.400]   And that every intent of the thoughts of his heart, can you go any deeper?
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.240]   Every intent of the thoughts of his heart, there's so much, you see that?
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.320]   Intent, thoughts, heart, it's going deeper and deeper, and it says that that was only
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.160]   evil continually.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.360]   That means without end, innumerable, and abundant.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.080]   "And the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and he was grieved in his heart.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.080]   Then the Lord said, 'I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land,
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.480]   from man to animals, to creeping things, and to birds of the sky, for I am sorry that I
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   have made them.'"
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.680]   Now look at the intentional God at work here to preserve and be gracious to people.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:34.880]   In chapter 8 verse 1, "But God remembered," and I would love for us not to have Noah here
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.040]   as the main thing.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:44.640]   I would like to say, let's focus on those first three words, "But God remembered."
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.000]   God remembered Noah and all the beasts and the cattle.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.480]   Noah is counted with the beasts and the cattle.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.200]   God, the point is God remembered.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.560]   "And God," it's not a wind came to pass.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.760]   God caused the wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.480]   It was intentional.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.440]   Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.480]   There's an active person in this, and that's God.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.400]   He closed it, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Who restrained it?
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.760]   God restrained it, and the water receded steadily from the earth.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   And at the end of 150 days, the water decreased.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.640]   In the seventh month, on the 17th day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   Ararat.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.020]   The water decreased steadily until the 10th month.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.040]   In the 10th month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:41.320]   I have no other explanation than this is called grace.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.520]   You see the Tower of Babel?
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.240]   God could have smote ... I forgot the past tense.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.000]   The smitten, smote, smited, whatever.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.560]   God could have done that to everyone, right?
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   And he should have.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.920]   He just scatters them.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.920]   It's grace.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.920]   He keeps saving.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.160]   He keeps preserving mankind.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.200]   In the patriarchs, when you read the stories of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph,
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.600]   when you look at the story of Israel in the wilderness with Moses and Joshua, when you
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.640]   see the story of Israel during the time of judges, these are all the different stories
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.840]   that Pastor Peter has been taking us through, through the book of Hebrews and the hall of
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840]   faith.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.360]   When we see all these people, you can't help when you read the Old Testament to see the
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:34.160]   sinfulness and the wickedness, even in what we would consider the best of us.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.920]   In the best king, in the best judge, in the best patriarch, it is just rampant evil in
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   these people.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:48.480]   And what you see is God's grace over and over and over and over again.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.840]   It does not stop.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.840]   It's not stopping.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   It's continual.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.180]   And his patience just keeps going.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.520]   You get through a certain part of the Old Testament, you want to tear your hair out.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.800]   What are you doing?
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.720]   How could anyone be this kind?
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.840]   How can you let these people breathe?
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.800]   Their very existence is an affront to you.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.600]   How can this be?
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.560]   Look at the kings that are supposed to be the type of Christ.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.360]   Even one we would consider perhaps the best, Hezekiah.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:39.840]   You see at the end of his life, in the final 15 years of his life, which by the way, Hezekiah
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:46.040]   when he gets diseased and then he cries out to God and he's in turmoil because he doesn't
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.720]   want to die.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.200]   And so God extends his life 15 years.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:57.080]   And in that last 15 years that he was extended, he goes on to sin.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:03.040]   And he is the one who opens up Judah to Babylon.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.840]   And during those last 15 years of God's extended grace in his life, he fathers Manasseh, who
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:15.520]   is perhaps one of the worst kings.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.320]   God is the one just saving and preserving and saving and preserving.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.280]   Every page of the Old Testament is grace upon grace upon grace upon grace.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.860]   The prophets come about and there's just warnings all over, right?
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.080]   What is God going to do?
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.920]   What God is going to do to you if you do not turn?
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.800]   You look at it and you can see like, man, God is grumpy.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:45.760]   Come on, parents out there.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.160]   Why do you warn your kids?
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.480]   Why do you warn your kids that if you continue down the path you're going, you are going
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.360]   to get a little spanking?
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:07.440]   Because you want them to stop and you want them to be good, right?
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:15.720]   And so that warning, how many of you parents have said like, I don't want to do this?
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.760]   I feel that almost every time when I spank my kids.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.040]   I don't want to.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.800]   It hurts me actually.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.760]   I get really sad.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.320]   Why?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.080]   Because I love them.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.160]   And so my warnings is love.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.640]   God, he cares.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.400]   He loves so much.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.760]   See the wrath stuff should make complete sense.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.480]   The grace stuff makes no sense.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.260]   In the Old Testament, the wrath stuff should be like, yeah.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:59.440]   And the grace stuff should be like, what?
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.320]   What is God doing?
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.440]   It should honestly make you question his goodness.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.520]   It should honestly make you question his justice.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:21.000]   Did you know that every breath you and I take is a demonstration of God's grace?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.080]   We ought to be wiped out, but God stays true in his loving kindness and his steadfast love.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.160]   Because we were born into the world as sinners and rebellious, there is no way the holy creator
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.480]   God should be able to coexist with sinners.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.320]   And so the question is still, how does this work?
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:44.080]   How does God remain good and just?
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.120]   You and I, we are entitled people.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.480]   We are selfish people.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   At heart, we are adulterers and we are murderers.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.520]   We break every command of God.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.200]   Our very existence is sin.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.960]   There is no best of us.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.160]   There is none righteous, not even one.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   We are all susceptible to the evils that we see around us.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:17.980]   And it should invoke an immediate eternal death sentence in our lives.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.880]   If you pause to look around this room, if you pause to go outside and look around at
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.480]   this world, even with all the chaos going on, if you're looking at reality, all you
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:34.320]   see all over the place, God's fingerprints of grace everywhere.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.720]   Everywhere.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:46.160]   Seven and a half billion examples of God's grace.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.360]   This is who God is.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.060]   In Exodus 34, 6, we'll go through just a number of passages here that describes who
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.060]   he is.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.220]   Then the Lord, this is when he goes in front of Moses and he goes past.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.460]   And I always thought this was really funny.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:08.460]   It's like this voice comes out as the presence of God, the very sight of God passes by Moses.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.940]   And then the Lord passed by in front of him and proclaimed.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.820]   It's so funny.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.020]   The Lord, the Lord God.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:21.580]   He could have chosen so many different ways to describe who he was.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:28.500]   But in this specific time, as he's passing by Moses, he chooses to describe a very particular
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.940]   portion or a particular attribute of who he is.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.980]   Because he could have easily have said, you know, the thrice holy thing.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.740]   He could have easily have said, I am a wrathful and good and just God.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.740]   I mean, he could have said a lot of things, but instead he chooses to say as he passes
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:50.500]   by this creature, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.500]   and truth.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.420]   That is what is proclaimed.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:58.260]   Because Moses should have died in his presence.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.860]   But God shields him.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.860]   And this is how he's described.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:08.140]   Psalm 86, 5, "For you, Lord, are good and ready to forgive and abundant in loving kindness
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.780]   to all who call upon you."
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.900]   All who call upon you.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.160]   And it's proven in Jonah chapter 4 verse 2.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.660]   And Jonah knows this of God.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.100]   He prayed to the Lord and said, "Please, Lord, was not this what I said while I was still
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.380]   in my own country?"
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.380]   Because Assyria turns, all of Nineveh turns.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.540]   It says, "Therefore, in order to forestall this, I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.860]   you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.740]   and one who relents concerning calamity."
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:40.340]   Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 31, "Nevertheless, in your great compassion, you did not make
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.380]   an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and compassionate God."
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:48.900]   To conclude, Numbers chapter 14 verse 18 says, "The Lord is slow to anger and abundant in
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.420]   loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression."
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.380]   This is who he is.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.340]   But we could stop there.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.740]   Man, so happy, right?
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:09.220]   But he will by no means clear the guilty.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:19.020]   Visiting the iniquity of the fathers and the children to the third and the fourth generations.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:30.300]   Have we become so entitled that we live our lives and we complain and we question God's
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.140]   goodness and grace?
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:44.380]   Don't we understand that our comprehension of his love for us, it can't happen.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:52.740]   It will just continue.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.260]   God is altogether gracious and kind.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:02.300]   And it should actually cause us to want to say, "This isn't fair, that you would let
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.660]   me live."
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:14.880]   This is the biblical worldview.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.460]   With all this talk of God's grace and compassion as we saw at the end of Numbers there, God's
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.300]   justice must be met.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.300]   He is still good.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.300]   He is still just.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.220]   He is still perfect in his standard.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:35.980]   So it says this in Romans 2, verse 5, "But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.900]   heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:45.980]   righteous judgment of God, who will render to," can I highlight this, "each person."
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:51.140]   That means it includes every single person that has ever been born.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.700]   Every person in this room I'm talking to, to you and to me, he will render to each person
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.540]   according to his deeds.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.100]   To those who by perseverance and doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.500]   life, but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.860]   wrath, and indignation, there will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.480]   evil of the Jew first and also of the Greek."
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.160]   What that means is there's nothing that a single person will ever get away with.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.920]   Talk about all the evil that we see in the world right now.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.260]   Right now we have some man-made righteousness just going everywhere, right?
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:32.140]   But talk about all the evil going on in the world we see, there is no single person that
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.340]   will get away with a single thing.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.580]   This is guaranteed.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:44.140]   That's why one day we die, come before our Maker, our Creator, and we will have to give
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.980]   an account.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:55.700]   Our standard of human justice pales in comparison to what is being stored for unbelieving people.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.660]   But this is not just for them because we are no better.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.480]   Every human is going to have to account for this.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.780]   In 2 Corinthians 5, verse 10 it says, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.280]   of Christ so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds."
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.620]   That means you will get what you deserve in the body according to what he has done, whether
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:19.820]   good or bad.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.420]   So what is that supposed to look like?
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:27.500]   What does it look like if I get paid for, if I get just recompense?
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:35.980]   I think the closest that we can get to a picture of it is found in the book of Revelation.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.940]   A picture of God's wrath made clear if you look at Revelation.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.620]   There are seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, and I'm just going to describe these
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:45.620]   things to you.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:51.340]   In the seals you see war and bloodshed, famine, plagues which wipe out a quarter of the world's
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:59.120]   population, martyrdom, huge earthquakes, blackened sun, red moons, stars that fall to earth.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:04.340]   Many cry out in the middle of this wrath that they want to die.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.340]   And then the trumpets come.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.340]   There's hail.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.660]   This is like hail on steroids.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.300]   Just hail and fire and death, darkening of the sun and moon.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:19.260]   Can you imagine if the sun just blotted out?
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:26.380]   There are torturing demonic locust plagues, all which kill a third.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.380]   I mean all of this stuff together kills a third of plant life, a majority of the earth's
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.300]   aquatic life, ultimately a third of humanity.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.140]   And that's not even done yet.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.880]   The bowls come, painful sores, blisters on all humanity.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.780]   Every person blisters.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:47.820]   Death of every living thing in the sea, every single living thing in the sea, death.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.820]   Rivers turn to blood.
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.940]   The sun's heat intensifying.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.220]   Darkness that falls upon the earth.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.280]   An army that marches across the world and another massive earthquake that precedes a
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:02.500]   hailed storm, giant blocks of ice.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:07.900]   That's not a bedtime story I'm giving to my kids.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:13.220]   I think that this is the closest I can imagine God's wrath.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.260]   It's pretty intense.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:26.620]   But what we see in Revelation is not even a speck on the tip of an iceberg of what God's
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.420]   wrath looks like.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.340]   Just recompense.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:39.140]   Like all this stuff, it doesn't even scratch the surface of how deep this goes, of what
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:49.560]   we deserve in God's wrath, and how furious he is against sin.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:58.620]   We have such a skewed view of sin and the Bible paints it accurately.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:09.660]   When we think of hell, what you see in Revelation is like people will dream of that.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:18.940]   How great that would be compared to the fury of hell.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.300]   The fact that we're walking around the way we are and the fact that not every single
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:32.260]   one of us are in hell right now, experiencing that, is God's grace.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:42.340]   It's God's grace.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:50.980]   The wrath of God is coming, but what that means is today I can't help but see my life
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:31:01.940]   and your life and the fact that we exist here in this world as it is now as God's grace.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:11.420]   When His wrath comes, when the day of judgment comes, there will be no hiding.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.060]   There will be no more continued patience.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.940]   There will be no more kindness.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:31.980]   There won't be any more desiring or having this opportunity to come to the Lord.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.380]   There will be no running from this wrath.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:40.380]   It is a guarantee that every sin will be repaid in full without a single drop overlooked.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.380]   Why?
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:49.500]   Because God is good and He is just.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.060]   There will be no hiding on that day.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.260]   And it says that in Amos chapter 9 verse 1 through 4, "I saw the Lord standing beside
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.460]   the altar and He said, 'Smite the capitals so that the thresholds will shake and break
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.100]   them on the heads of them all.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.220]   Then I will slay the rest of them with a sword.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.740]   They will not have a fugitive who will flee or a refugee who will escape.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.860]   Though they dig into Sheol, from there will My hand take them.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.660]   And though they ascend to heaven, from there will I bring them down.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.220]   Though they hide on the summit of Carmel, I will search them out and take them from
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.220]   there.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.540]   And though they conceal themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea, and from there
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.980]   I will command the serpent and it will bite them.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.780]   And though they go into captivity before the enemies, from there I will command the sword
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.820]   that it slay them.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.280]   And I will set My eyes against them for evil and not for good.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:39.840]   And this is going to be our reality for all humanity that encounters God's wrath in
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   full.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:46.080]   That they will want to hide but there will be no hiding and this will be for eternity."
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.080]   This is depressing.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:52.880]   But again, we are not there yet.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.080]   And just like in the Old Testament where we're wondering why the next chapters keep going,
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.480]   what we have to do is question why, if I encounter an unbeliever here in this world, why his
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.520]   chapters keep going.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.640]   And then in the Old Testament, if it was because of God's grace, then I can't help
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.080]   but look at his life and realize that this is God's grace in his life.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.480]   And then when I ask the question of God, why do you let him continue?
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.560]   It's because he desires none to perish and for all to come to repentance.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.900]   Then when I see this unbelieving person, then I need to understand and know that God desires
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.160]   for this person not to perish and to come to repentance.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.980]   It is His grace.
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:35.480]   And so as we sit here on Good Friday, a week where Jesus intentionally marches to the cross,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:44.040]   where we see this great intersection of God's grace and His wrath, of His fury and His love
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.440]   for us.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.320]   When we see the great intersection of it, that we understand that God is not just partly
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.600]   gracious, partly just.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.080]   It's not like He has 50% this, He has 50% that.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   It's not that.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.600]   He is fully gracious.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.880]   He is fully just.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:10.480]   And what we see at the cross is where we see it, where we marvel, where we stand dumbstruck
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   and awestruck at the God that He is.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:21.720]   What we see at the cross brings us to a place where it's hard to make sense of any of it.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:30.920]   And literally, the cross leaves us at a place where the only possible thing is worship.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:42.080]   It leaves us in awe and wonder and amazement because all of this stored judgment that all
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:48.480]   humanity is meant to pay for, all humanity will one day meet as God pours out judgment
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.240]   on the earth.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:59.720]   This is a crazy thing because the possibility of people continuing in God's grace is because
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:06.580]   of tonight.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:14.960]   Because God's judgment and wrath for anyone who would place their faith in Him would in
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:25.760]   full, not a single drop unaccounted for, be pressed onto Jesus Christ.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:37.040]   This is what Jesus was every day this week, every day of His life, walking towards intentionally.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.120]   Wrath.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:45.800]   Jesus knew this and we're gonna just end this time.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.160]   It's gonna be a little bit lengthy so don't take that cue to say we're almost done.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.360]   But let's look at Jesus.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:00.120]   And this is where you need to do some work for me in imagining this.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.200]   What Jesus is walking towards.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.760]   Wrath.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.720]   Matthew 26, 38, "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.120]   Remain here and keep watch with me.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.680]   My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me, yet not as I will but as you
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   will.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.800]   My Father, if this cannot pass away until I drink it, unless I drink it, your will be
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.280]   done."
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.840]   Jesus is grieved deeply.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:33.040]   He is gonna take hell.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.560]   And so what we see this night is Judas completing his betrayal of Jesus on this Friday, kissing
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.520]   Jesus on the cheek as a sign to the mob of people wielding swords and clubs, directly
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.600]   sent from the chief priests who have been trying to trap Him and elders who had sent
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   them.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.760]   And Peter tries to stop them and he pulls out his sword and he strikes the ear of the
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.760]   slave.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.040]   Now how brave of Peter to go after the slave, you know?
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:01.320]   He chooses the pipsqueak.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.880]   But Jesus didn't need Peter to rescue Him because He was walking this path.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.120]   Jesus says, in a single word, snap of the fingers, 12 legions of angels, let's do the
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:18.920]   math, at least 72,000 angels would be at His beckoning to descend and to rescue and it
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:28.520]   would be a wrathful massacre, giving people just recompense.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:35.760]   We see back in history, one angel wipes out 185,000 of Sennacherib's army in a single
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   night.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:43.720]   You have 72,000 angels and a snap of His fingers to come and do what is right.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:48.320]   He says, "Peter, what you doing?"
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:56.680]   And then Jesus walks before this human, Caiaphas, and this human council.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:02.200]   Peter keeps his distance, this human keeps his distance and denies Jesus three times.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.760]   And these humans, chief priests, and the whole council, they attempt to find false testimony
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.600]   on Jesus Christ.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:17.160]   But there's none available because He lived His life perfectly.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:22.700]   Even though many false witnesses come forward, they are not believed because He lived unbelievably
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:30.280]   above reproach, but they find a way to get at Jesus and cry, "Blasphemy."
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:39.200]   And then Matthew 26, 67, these humans, imagine Jesus here, what He's doing to take the sins
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.360]   of the world, where He's marching towards so that I might not experience that.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.960]   These humans come and they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists and others slapped
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.520]   Him and said, "Prophesy to us, you Christ.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.080]   Who is the one who hit you?"
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.000]   The answer is all of us.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.400]   Peter again spends this time denying Jesus.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.320]   And what we see here, you know these days we see a popular thing where people say, "Don't
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.000]   look away from the atrocities that you see in this world.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Don't look away, don't look away."
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.080]   You know, I agree with this sentiment.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   We shouldn't.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.040]   We should grieve.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.240]   We should hurt.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:28.560]   But I'd like to apply it here, asking us all this Good Friday to look at the reality.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.840]   Because all mankind deserves is God's wrath.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:38.400]   We can't look away at the fact that what Jesus is doing here and walking towards this, it's
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:45.020]   absurd.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.620]   Don't ever look away at what Jesus was doing here.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.840]   Jesus is continuing to willingly, intentionally walk to the very point which He would absorb
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.440]   the wrath.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.440]   And everything that's happening to Jesus up to this point is still nothing compared to
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.580]   the wrath to come.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.200]   So what they do is they bind Jesus.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.180]   Humans bind Jesus' hands.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.800]   And they deliver Him to Pilate, another human.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   And he asked Jesus, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.020]   Upon which Jesus responds, "It is as you say."
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:16.200]   And they enter into the custom of allowing one prisoner to be freed by popular consent.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:22.680]   And so a notorious prisoner by the name of Barabbas is the one they scream for to free
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.680]   Him.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.880]   The noted killer, the insurrectionist, to free Him and the innocent Christ, the Son
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.220]   of God, to be brutally tortured and murdered on the cross.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:38.020]   And so they take Jesus into the praetorium and gather the whole Roman cohort now.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.520]   And they strip Jesus.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.200]   And they put a scarlet robe on Him.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.640]   And they twist together a crown of thorns and they place it on His head and they jam
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.160]   it down into His skull.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.380]   And then they mock Him.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.240]   And then they spit on Him some more.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:02.820]   And then they beat Him on the head.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:08.820]   And they crucify Jesus on that cross next to two robbers.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:14.540]   And even there Jesus takes time to speak words of comfort to one of them.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:21.160]   Now let me read the rest of the count in Matthew, verse 45, as we see the final breath of our
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.340]   Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.700]   Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:32.220]   And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.780]   That is my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.940]   And some of those who were standing there when they heard it began saying, "This man
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.460]   is calling for Elijah."
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.820]   Immediately one of them ran and taking a sponge he filled it with sour wine and put it on
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.900]   a reed and gave him a drink.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:53.140]   But the rest of them said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:42:06.100]   And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up His Spirit.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.100]   He dies.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:14.700]   He dies and at this point He is absorbing.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:19.140]   You know what is going on at this point?
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:24.700]   The wrath of God.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:30.060]   This is not like a little hiatus in His existence.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.300]   He is absorbing it.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.860]   I don't know exactly how that looks.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.420]   Maybe it will be explained to us.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.540]   But that is what is happening.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.420]   And so in verse 51 it says, "And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.380]   to bottom and the earth shook and the rocks were split.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.700]   The tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.900]   And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.900]   many.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:01.600]   And now the centurion and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.300]   the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, 'Truly this
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.780]   was the Son of God.'"
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:14.220]   What we are witnessing here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:19.500]   In 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21 it says, "God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:26.180]   behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.180]   What we see on this way to the cross is Jesus in Isaiah 53 verse 4-7.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:36.780]   "Surely our griefs He Himself bore and our sorrows He carried, yet we ourselves esteemed
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:44.300]   Him stricken, smitten of God, afflicted.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.900]   He was pierced through for our transgression.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.860]   He was crushed for our iniquity.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:53.980]   The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him and by His scourging we are healed.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.700]   All of us like sheep have gone astray.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:00.340]   Each of us has turned to his own way, but the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.180]   to fall on Him.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.660]   He was oppressed and He was afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:09.700]   Like a lamb that is led to slaughter and like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.860]   so He did not open His mouth."
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:17.900]   So on Good Friday when we think of Jesus walking to the cross, we have to remember what was
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.180]   happening.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:25.260]   That the only innocent one to walk the earth was marching with His crucifix to hang on
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.780]   a tree, but He would not just die for our sins and just do whatever for like, "Oh,
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:34.220]   He forgives."
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:39.820]   He was taking upon Himself the very sin of every person who had placed their faith in
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.320]   Him.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:46.900]   Every single one of us will die in the flesh, but we will, every single one of us, awaken
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.900]   to a spiritual reality before the judgment of God.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:55.320]   And regardless of the opinions of every individual, this truthful and certain reality waits every
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:00.580]   single one of us that we will indeed kneel before the Creator and wrath is what each
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:05.300]   of us deserves.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.180]   And if you have not placed your faith in the only one who is able to take upon the full
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:15.820]   brunt of the wrath of God which is found on this Good Friday, you stand naked and exposed
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:20.460]   before God.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:27.660]   You have nothing to hide behind, no more place of grace, and it's coming.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:34.460]   You have to mark my words here, it's coming for you.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:44.700]   But if you place your faith in Him, at that place when you come before judgment and you're
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:51.700]   kneeling before the Creator and He is about to explode on you, if you place your faith
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:59.300]   in Christ, you will find a Savior who stands before you and God.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:07.020]   You will be literally staring up at the back of your Savior, the one who took the full
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:17.340]   brunt of it, the one who stood as a propitiation for your sin, to appease the fury and goodness
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.820]   and justice of God.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:26.580]   He will stand between you and God and He has taken every blow.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:37.660]   Jesus willingly takes that for you if you place your faith in Him.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.340]   To conclude, let me read from Hebrews chapter 2 verse 9.
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:47.820]   "But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely Jesus,
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.540]   because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.460]   of God He might taste death for everyone."
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.460]   Wow.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:03.400]   "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things,
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:10.540]   in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.300]   For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father, for which
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:22.260]   reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren."
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:27.220]   Would you take a moment here to bow your heads with me and on this Good Friday, make this
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.220]   personal.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:39.420]   If you're a believer, we need to again remember what He did on that cross and experienced
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.860]   again the fullness of what happened there.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.340]   We need to stand in awe and gratitude.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:54.980]   If our hearts have been far, if our hearts have been cold, if the gospel has become stale,
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:48:02.660]   let's take this time tonight again to consider our Savior.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:12.220]   This is also going to be a time where we partake in communion together and we can meditate
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:17.820]   and concentrate and think upon the blood that was shed for us, upon the body that was broken
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:25.180]   for us, that we can now partake in Jesus Christ Himself.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:30.780]   Would you use this time to examine yourself and to meditate on the body of Christ broken
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:35.020]   for you and the blood of Christ shed for you.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:40.460]   And this communion is a time for baptized believers if you are to participate, so please
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:46.860]   refrain from participating in it if you are not a baptized believer and simply observe.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.020]   But all of us now for the next few minutes, we will give you this opportunity to pray
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.660]   and to meditate and come before the Lord.
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.060]   Think about what He's done.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:01.780]   After praying, I'll come back up and I'm going to read for us from 1 Corinthians 11
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:05.300]   and we'll take up the communion together so you can wait for further instruction there.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.980]   But for now, would you join me in prayer?
