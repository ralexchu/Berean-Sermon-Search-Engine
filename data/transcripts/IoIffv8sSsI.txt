[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   Good morning. Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   As you can see, we're going to have our communion today.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.680]   We're going back to our old way.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   I'll give you instructions right before we start it
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   and also explain why our church has chosen to do it in this manner.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.680]   Maybe the other way that we've been doing it may be simpler and easier and efficient,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.700]   but we are doing this deliberately, and I'll explain that a little bit before we get started.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.700]   Let me get into a few announcements.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.700]   Our Family Ministry Christmas Lunches, if you desire to participate in that,
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.700]   the sign-ups are taking place right now, and on December 11th, which is next Sunday,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.700]   you'll be put into groups, and then you'll be instructed to go,
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.720]   and they'll give you instructions for that.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   Also, on New Year's, there's a ping-pong tournament going on at 5.30,
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   and again, at all levels, and the entrance fee, I believe, is $5.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   And so after the ping-pong tournament, this year we're going to start
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   our New Year's Eve service at 11, and it's a little bit earlier than normal,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   and the reason why is because we have service the next day,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.740]   so New Year's Eve is on a Saturday night, and then we want you to be at home sleeping by 12.30.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.740]   So as soon as it's over, we want to give you plenty of time to go home and rest,
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.740]   and then so our Sunday service, New Year's Eve first,
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.740]   and then we are planning to have special lunch prepared for that,
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:31.740]   and so come ready to eat that New Year's Eve day.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.740]   No, New Year's Day, okay?
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.740]   And so just keep that in mind, and a couple other things.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.760]   When you were coming in, you probably got a postcard, postcard, whatever you want to call this.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   This basically is to remind you of the Christmas service that's going on,
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   and every year, Christmas is probably, you know, one of the days
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   where there's a lot of people who normally don't go to church,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.760]   are willing to come to church, even a lot of non-Christians,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   so we have a lot of visitors that come on that day,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.760]   and so we want to use that opportunity to do two things.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.780]   One, you can take this and give it to your non-Christian friends, coworkers, family members,
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.780]   and invite them to the service as we explain about the Incarnation,
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.780]   the meaning of Christmas, and obviously that's going to take us into the Gospel message,
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.780]   and so it would be a good opportunity for non-Christian friends
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   that if you're waiting for a particular time to bring them and introduce them,
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.780]   this would be a good time to do that.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.780]   So this would be for you to take and to give to people.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.780]   So you can take as much as you want. We'll print more if we need it.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.780]   But the other part of it is, as you are inviting people, and even if they don't come,
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.780]   it'd be an opportunity to kind of break the ice, and to be able to open a conversation
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.780]   when they say, "Why is Christmas so important?"
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.780]   and to be able to share with them what Christmas means, the Gospel message.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.780]   So even if you feel like they're not going to come, it'd be an opportunity as you're inviting them
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.780]   to maybe break the ice and share the Gospel with them.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.780]   And so please take this, as many as you need, and if we need more, as I said, we'll replenish that.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.780]   One last thing, and I'm going to announce this a few more times before it happens.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:13.780]   Every Christmas we have a Lottie Moon offering, and that's used for the missionaries who are out in the field.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.780]   And so especially in the last few years, because of the pandemic,
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.780]   the missionaries have been moved around, as you guys know.
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:25.780]   And so there's a lot of funding that was needed to kind of move them around from country to country,
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.780]   and they're slowly starting to start to go back to their mission field.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:36.780]   And so we're asking that we collectively give for that purpose, for the missions,
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.780]   and then we hand it over to the IMB, and they'll use and distribute it.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.780]   And so that's how we collect missions offering every year.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:48.780]   So we want you to be mindful about that, and so on Christmas Day, we'll have a special Lottie Moon offering.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:54.780]   And that's what our denomination calls it, but particularly it's for missions, oversee missions.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.780]   So I'll remind you as we get closer to the date, but that's coming up,
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.780]   but we want you to kind of give purposefully for that reason.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.780]   All right, I think that's all the announcements for today.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.780]   Let me pray for us for the offering.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.780]   Again, if you're paying electronically, try to use Zelle.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.780]   If you don't have any other avenue, Venmo is an option, but if it's possible, try to use Zelle.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.780]   Those of you guys who have physical offering, again, our physical offering box is in the back.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.780]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.780]   Gracious Father, we thank you for our salvation.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.780]   Thank you for the access that we have in you.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:39.780]   We know what a privilege it is, Lord God, to be living in this country where we can practice our faith
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.780]   and gather together in worship without fear of physical harm.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:50.780]   But we also know we have many brothers and sisters around the world, Lord God, where this is such a privilege.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:56.780]   Help us, Lord, to continue to take advantage of what you've given us,
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.780]   that as we gather that you would strengthen your church,
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:04.780]   that we would become a brighter and brighter light where you have placed us.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.780]   I pray, Father, that our worship would be given to you in spirit and in truth,
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.780]   that even in the giving that we would give purposefully, cheerfully,
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.780]   that it may be multiplied for your use.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.780]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.780]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 4.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:32.780]   We're going to be in this text for a few more weeks.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:42.780]   Luke chapter 4, and I will be reading starting from verse 1 all the way down to verse 13 today.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:49.780]   "Jesus followed the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.780]   And he ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, he became hungry.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.780]   And the devil said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, tell the stone to become bread.'
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.780]   And Jesus answered him, 'It is written, "Man shall not live on bread alone."'
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.780]   And he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:15.780]   And the devil said to him, 'I will give you all this domain and its glory, for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.780]   Therefore, if you worship before me, it shall all be yours.'
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.780]   Jesus answered him, 'It is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him only."'
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   And he led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him,
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.780]   'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.780]   For it is written, "He will command his angels concerning you to guard you,
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.780]   and on their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not strike your foot against the stone."'
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.780]   And Jesus answered and said to him, 'It is said, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test."'
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.780]   When the devil had finished every temptation, he left him until an opportune time.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.780]   Let's pray.
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:00.780]   Gracious Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:10.780]   We pray for hearts that are fertile, ears that are open, and wills, Lord God, that are eager to apply.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:18.780]   May your word and your word alone go forth and will not return as you have promised until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.780]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:26.780]   I don't know how many of you guys are aware, but we, in our church, we actually have a security team.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.780]   And you don't know who they are because they don't have security uniforms on.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:35.780]   And years ago, there was a discussion, and it is led by our Elder James.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:40.780]   And so we have police officers at our church that are helping out with that.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.780]   And so they are scattered throughout the church.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.780]   And so, just in case, right?
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:52.780]   And I think in the last two to three years, especially when the BLM, the marching was going on,
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.780]   there was a lot of threats, specifically to churches.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.780]   And we were hearing on the news that they were going into churches.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   And again, there were actually some shootings that were going on inside the church.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.780]   And so, to take that threat seriously, not that we are expecting anything to happen,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:12.780]   but it is good to have a security just in case if anything does happen, we are at least somewhat prepared for that.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:22.780]   Now, when there is any kind of threat in our lives, we are going to do everything in our power to at least try to be ready, to minimize the danger.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:34.780]   If you knew that there was a threat to your home, that you got a notice from your HOA or police station saying that there is a crazy guy in your neighborhood with a gun,
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:39.780]   and he is just breaking into homes, that you guys really need to prepare yourself.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.780]   You are going to make sure that that door is locked.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.780]   You are going to make sure that it is not easy to break in.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.780]   You are going to make sure, maybe even purchase a firearm or something.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:53.780]   You are going to do everything in your power to protect yourself because of the danger in your neighborhood.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:30:05.780]   Now, I bring all of this up not to tell you to feel secure at church or we need to be ready, although that would be our natural response.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:11.780]   In the text that we are looking at, there are different characters that are presented to us.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.780]   And obviously, we talked about the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:22.780]   So, even though it was not the main part of the text, I think it is important for us to understand the role that the Holy Spirit is playing in Jesus' temptation.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.780]   We looked at Jesus himself, right, that in his humanity.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:32.780]   And the reason why he is even able to be tempted is because he veiled his glory.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.780]   And so, Satan is coming to him trying to tempt him.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:41.780]   But there is a character in here that is a major character that sometimes we can just kind of brush over.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.780]   And that is the devil himself.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.780]   The devil himself plays a major role in this temptation.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:53.780]   And so, in each of these events, it says that the Holy Spirit led him to be tempted by the devil.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.780]   The devil is playing an active role.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:04.780]   In fact, the demonic presence in the life of redemptive history begins from Genesis.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.780]   He does not just come in somewhere way down the line and waits until Jesus shows up.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.780]   If you read the Bible, just as the Holy Spirit sometimes is in the background, we do not notice.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.780]   It is kind of a side character that sometimes we do not notice.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:23.780]   And in the same way, we can kind of look at the devil and he is also a side character.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.780]   He just kind of mentioned he is there, but then we talk about all these other events that are going on.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:36.780]   But if you read the Old Testament and the New Testament carefully, demonic activity is very prevalent all throughout redemptive history.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:43.780]   In every act of God that is significant enough that was recorded, there is some sort of demonic activity that is taking place.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:51.780]   I think Dr. Harris in his book, Darkness and the Glory, he has a chapter on that where he kind of chronicles the demonic activity in redemptive history.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:32:01.780]   The reason why I bring this up is as we are getting into the meat of the text, and we are going to jump into the different temptations,
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:13.780]   but it is important for us to recognize the demonic activity that not only is taking place here, but the demonic activity that is also taking place in our lives.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:20.780]   They did a survey of the whole United States and they asked if you believe in God.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:26.780]   Now, that does not mean that everybody who said that they believe in God believes in the Judeo-Christian God.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:34.780]   But particularly in the United States, the majority of those who said that they believe in God obviously have a Judeo-Christian background, whether they are Christian or not.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:41.780]   They said that over 90% of people who were surveyed in the United States say that they believe in God.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:48.780]   Living in California, you may not feel that way, but if you have ever been to the Bible Belt of the country,
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:55.780]   one time I was at Knoxville, Tennessee, not Nashville, Nashville has become a little bit more secular.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:03.780]   If you go to Knoxville, Tennessee, I was there for some thing that I was doing and they asked me, "What do you do for a living?"
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:08.780]   I said, "I am a pastor." Clearly, the people that I was talking to were not Christians.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.780]   I am not going to describe to you why I do not believe they were Christians.
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:18.780]   But they said, "Oh, you are a pastor." "Oh, my sister is a pastor." "My uncle is a pastor." "My grandfather is a pastor."
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.780]   "My brother is a pastor." "I think my father wanted to be a pastor."
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:28.780]   And so basically, kind of, you know, talked about how like seven, eight different people in their lives,
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:34.780]   "Oh yeah, yeah, we are Christian. Good, good for you." You know, and said, "Yeah, I go to church. All my life I go to church."
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:40.780]   And if you have ever been in that area, you will see a church like literally like two per block.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.780]   I mean, it is so, over there you can see it is probably more than 90%.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   But this was a survey that was taken all across the board in the United States. More than 90% say that they believe in God.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:58.780]   Now, what is interesting is, the same people that was interviewed that asked and said, "Do you believe in God?"
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.780]   75% of them say that they do not believe in the devil.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.780]   Which is interesting. Right?
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:10.780]   If you believe in God, why would it be so hard to believe in the devil?
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.780]   Especially as Christians, I mean, we are reading the same Bible.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.780]   And this is my theory. This may not, I do not know how accurate this theory is, but this is my theory.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   Why would they have such a hard time? Why would they think it is almost comical to believe in the devil,
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.780]   but they have no problem saying that they believe in God?
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.780]   My theory is, majority of those people who claim to believe in God,
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.780]   obviously they are not, even the ones who say that they are Christians, they do not believe in the God of the Bible.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:42.780]   So, the God that they believe is only benevolent.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:47.780]   The God that they have professed to believe is, like, when you are in trouble, He will help you.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:53.780]   That if you honor Him, that He is going to bless you. He is going to multiply your health and wealth.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:35:00.780]   And so, demonic activity does not fit into the culture that they have created.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.780]   The God that they have embraced, so where would the devil fit into that?
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:11.780]   Everybody dies, everybody goes to heaven, God always loves us, He is for us, you know, and He loves us unconditionally.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:18.780]   And so, the God that they have embraced does not have room for the devil.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.780]   Now, we know that a lot of them are not Christians, but if we were to come into the church and ask,
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:34.780]   maybe even in this room, how prevalent is the thought of demonic activity, is it in your life?
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:39.780]   Now, if you are a Bible-believing Christian, you are going to say on paper that you believe in God.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   If you believe in God, why wouldn't you believe in the devil? Right?
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.780]   So, of course, we believe in the devil.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.780]   But what effect does it have on your walk with God?
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:54.780]   How aware are you that there is demonic activity in your life?
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:01.780]   I believe, again, this is my theory, but part of the reason why the mention of the devil,
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.780]   and we hear it every once in a while, why it's always in the background,
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:13.780]   is because maybe even the way that we think about God is not accurate to what we see in Scripture.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:19.780]   Because God helps us in times of need, He forgives us unconditionally,
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:25.780]   and so, one saved always saved, and so the way that we think of God,
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.780]   maybe there's no room for the devil.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.780]   What would the devil be doing when we are completely protected, and whatever we do, we're safe, and God loves us,
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.780]   and once we die, we're going to persevere, we're going to go to heaven.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.780]   So, what place does the devil play in that paradigm?
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:47.780]   Maybe the reason why we don't think about that is because he doesn't necessarily fit into our mindset either.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:53.780]   Well, Ephesians 6, 10-12, Paul says to the church,
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.780]   "Be strong in the Lord and in strength of His might.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:02.780]   Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.780]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:11.780]   but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of darkness,
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.780]   against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places."
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.780]   He reminds them that in the context of sharing the gospel, building the church, and raising families,
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.780]   that there is demonic activity.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.780]   That our struggle is not against the government, our struggle is not against the economy,
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.780]   it's not against people, he says it's against demonic forces.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.780]   And that's why he says you have to put on the full armor of God.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.780]   If we were fighting politics, we'd just get the right politicians in there.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:47.780]   If we're fighting economics, get the smartest economics professor to be the leader of the church.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.780]   But he says it's spiritual.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.780]   Therefore, he says to pray.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.780]   After you put on the full armor of God, you have to pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:00.780]   Because this is not something that you can win by your own might.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:08.780]   By organizing, by having money, by being trained, by having experience, by being gifted.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.780]   He says our battle is beyond that.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.780]   And if we forget that, it doesn't matter how organized you are,
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.780]   it doesn't matter how big you make your church.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:22.780]   You cannot fight demonic powers by physical power.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:27.780]   In fact, in Matthew 6, verse 13, if you remember the Lord's Prayer,
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.780]   if you've memorized the Lord's Prayer, part of the Lord's Prayer says,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.780]   "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:39.780]   If you happen to have the NIV or King James or New King James,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.780]   your Bible reads this way,
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.780]   "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:47.780]   Right?
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.780]   So if you have the NIV, you already knew that.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.780]   And the reason why is because NIV and King James were based,
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.780]   the translations were based on later manuscripts.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.780]   And in later manuscripts, it makes it into a person.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.780]   Now, whether you have the older version or the newer version,
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.780]   whether it says the evil or the evil one,
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.780]   it's important for us to recognize that when we think of evil,
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.780]   it is not just some force.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.780]   It is not just some malevolent force that kind of wants to do bad.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.780]   It's not just some ambiguous power.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:30.780]   The Bible describes evil from a being, from an individual, Satan himself.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   The names that Satan is called in different ways,
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.780]   some of these names actually describes who he is.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:45.780]   Prince of Darkness, the Elzebab, Lord of the Flies, Antichrist,
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:52.780]   Father of Lies, the Great Dragon, the Old Serpent, the Accuser,
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:40:00.780]   Adversary, Belial, Angel of Light, Murderer, Enemy,
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.780]   the Evil One, the Tempter, Satan.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.780]   There are other names that are given to him,
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:15.780]   but all of these things describe his nature and his activity.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.780]   And we are told that we ought to pay very close attention.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.780]   So there's only one devil, but many demons.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.780]   So the devil is not running around everywhere because he is not omnipresent,
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.780]   nor is he omnipotent.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.780]   But it is a very powerful being, and Revelation chapter 12, 3-4,
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.780]   most theologians believe that's a description of Satan's fall,
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:41.780]   and it says, "In his fall, he swings his tail, and a third of the angels fall with him."
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:47.780]   So when the Bible describes devil and his angels, he's talking about the third.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   Now if you know anything about angels in the Bible,
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.780]   the angels, a single angel is powerful enough to thwart an army,
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.780]   and he has the third of it.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:04.780]   So the demonic power and influence is tremendous.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:10.780]   I want to take some time this morning to at least cause us to be aware
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.780]   of the warning that we have been given about demonic activity.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:22.780]   So when we look at the temptation that we realize that this has been going on from the beginning.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:29.780]   Satan has been thwarting, trying to take away God's glory from the beginning of creation,
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:33.780]   and he has not let up at all, and this is continually what he is doing.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.780]   When we look at the temptation of Jesus, it's not simply, "Oh, Jesus went through that, and he conquered,"
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.780]   and yes, all of it is true, and that's the most significant part of the temptation,
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.780]   but his temptation represents the fall of mankind.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:50.780]   And Satan, even today, and even in your life, even right now,
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.780]   is actively working to devour each one of us.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.780]   And so we need to be aware where the attack is coming,
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:03.780]   because the person who is the most dangerous is the one who doesn't recognize that you're in battle.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.780]   That you're living in a time of peace when there's war going on,
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:11.780]   when your enemy is trying to deliberately break you down, and you're not aware of it.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.780]   And so that person is in the greatest danger.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.780]   So this morning, I want to kind of at least present to you,
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:23.780]   to at least put into your mind that this is real.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.780]   As much as we profess to believe God, that same God that we believe,
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:33.780]   the same Bible that we read, tells us about demonic activity.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.780]   Let's go to the beginning of Satan's creation.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.780]   Who is he?
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:44.780]   Typically, a lot of people, if I was to ask you to draw a picture of the devil,
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.780]   the picture of the devil that you may draw is probably from some cartoon,
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:52.780]   or some media, or some movie that you watch.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.780]   So basically, it's a caricature of the reality.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:03.780]   But if you actually read the scripture, it doesn't look anything like how the Bible describes it.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:10.780]   In Ezekiel 28, 12-13, and 15-19, it describes to us Satan's creation and his fall.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.780]   It says, "Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre and Satan."
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.780]   So he's right off the bat, "Oh, king of Tyre, how's that Satan?"
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:24.780]   Well, you'll see why the theologians believe that even though it is a letter written to
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.780]   and addressed the issue of that time, that there's something bigger going.
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:34.780]   A lot like a lot of the messianic prophecies, where he was speaking to a particular king,
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.780]   but clearly the application was much bigger than that.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   "Thus says the Lord God, 'You had the seal of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.780]   For in Eden, the garden of God, every precious stone was your covering.'"
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.780]   So clearly, this cannot be a physical person.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.780]   King Tyre is talking about Satan.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   And you'll see as we go.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.780]   But look at how he's described.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.780]   "You had the seal of perfection."
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.780]   He said, "Full of wisdom."
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.780]   Full of wisdom.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.780]   Remember who is described as having full of wisdom?
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.780]   King Solomon, the wisest person.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:20.780]   He said he was filled with wisdom and perfect in beauty.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.780]   I don't know how Solomon looked, but I don't think he was perfect in beauty.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.780]   God made him full of wisdom, perfect in beauty.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.780]   So this ugly picture that you have of Satan is not accurate.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:35.780]   That's the picture that you may think of when you say the devil.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:41.780]   You may be, they may be drawing or projecting the moral character of the devil.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:47.780]   But the actual physical appearance of the devil, he said, it's beautiful.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:56.780]   So in fact, if you actually were able to see the devil, he said he was made perfect in beauty.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.780]   So what makes the devil the devil is not his physical qualities, but his moral quality.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.780]   He was perfect.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:08.780]   "You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until unrighteousness was found in you.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.780]   By the abundance of your trade, you were internally filled with violence."
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.780]   So the corruption happened internally.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.780]   "And you sinned."
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.780]   Right?
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.780]   It doesn't make him ugly all of a sudden.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.780]   And when you sin, right, it doesn't make you ugly.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.780]   Your physical appearance doesn't change.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.780]   So he's still beautiful.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.780]   He's still filled with wisdom.
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.780]   He's made perfect.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:38.780]   "Therefore I have cast you as profane from the mountain of God, and I have destroyed you, a covering of cherub, and from the midst of the stones of fire."
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.780]   And then verse 17 describes his fall.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.780]   "Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:49.780]   You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor."
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.780]   Everything that was given to him was corrupted because of what?
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.780]   His own pride.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.780]   Because of his arrogance.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   Because he was made so beautiful.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.780]   He said, "I am so beautiful.
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.780]   Maybe I can challenge God.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.780]   Maybe I can touch some of His glory.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.780]   Why aren't people worshipping me?"
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.780]   He said, "That was the fall of Satan."
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:15.780]   Now, the reason why I share this with you is because this is what he was tempted by.
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.780]   This is how he tempts you.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.780]   This is how he tempts us.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:27.780]   Think about how much of our life is about getting attention.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:34.780]   I mean, think about when you got up this morning and you put on your whatever it is that you put on.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:39.780]   How many of you looked at it and said, "I'm going to put the ugliest thing that I have in the closet today."
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.780]   I changed my tie twice because it didn't match my red shirt.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.780]   Now, why did it have to match?
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.780]   Because I want you to like me.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.780]   That's why.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.780]   Right?
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.780]   I don't want you to send me texts like, "Can you please wear something else?"
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.780]   Right?
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:59.780]   Everything that we do is really, in the end, like there's some level of self-presentation
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.780]   because we want people to see us a certain way.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.780]   We work hard because we want to drive a certain car.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.780]   We want to live in a certain house.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:12.780]   And so much of it is so that we can be better in this world.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.780]   You started out low.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.780]   You worked hard.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:17.780]   Got good education.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.780]   You know, play baseball, softball, football, whatever it is.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   But the purpose is to win.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.780]   It's to get on top.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.780]   Now, all of it, in and of itself, is not evil.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   But at the core of what drives us, if we're not careful, is similar to Satan's fall.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.780]   Because he was made beautiful, his beauty corrupted him.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.780]   And his wisdom became corrupt because he said, "Look how wise I am."
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:54.780]   Pride and this coveting, no matter how small it may be, enters into him and corrupts him.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:48:02.780]   There's a reason why Jesus brings up the corruption of pride in the Pharisees over and over again.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:08.780]   That slight little bit of pride, it ruins everything that we do.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.780]   Even in the context of preaching the gospel.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.780]   Even in the context of doing God's work.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.780]   We're always comparing.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.780]   We don't just want God to just get the glory.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:24.780]   We want God to get the glory through me.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.780]   And so all it takes is some pride.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:33.780]   You stick a little bit of pride in there and it ruins every good endeavor.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.780]   That was Satan's fall.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.780]   I cast you into the ground.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.780]   I put you before the kings that they may see you.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.780]   Isaiah also describes the fall of Satan.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.780]   And he says this, Isaiah 14, 12-15.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.780]   "How you have fallen from heaven, O star of morning, son of the dawn.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.780]   You have been cut down to the earth, you who have weakened the nations."
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.780]   And listen here from verse 13.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.780]   "You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.780]   I will raise my throne above the stars of God.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.780]   And I will sit on the mount of assembly in the recesses of the north.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.780]   I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.780]   I will make myself like the Most High.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.780]   Nevertheless, you will be thrust down to Sheol, to the recesses of the pit.'"
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.780]   God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.780]   You notice here, describing the fall,
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:28.780]   where every part of it is, "I will ascend. I will do this. I will do this. I will do this."
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.780]   The only person that can say that and be accurate is God.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.780]   I Am.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   He's the only I Am.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.780]   So the "I will" that Satan is proclaiming is the arrogance of,
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.780]   "I will do this. I'm going to do what only you can do.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.780]   I can try. I can wish. But you will not."
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.780]   That's why he says in the book of James,
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.780]   "Don't say, 'Today or tomorrow I'm going to go here. I'm going to do that.'"
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.780]   That's arrogance.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:58.780]   He doesn't say, "If the Lord permits it. If it is the will of the Lord."
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.780]   In other words, recognize who you are.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.780]   The only one that can say, "I will" is God.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:08.780]   And in his arrogance, he said, "I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that."
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.780]   Because he was made powerful.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:19.780]   In fact, the greatest concern of leadership is not ability.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:24.780]   If we put somebody in leadership, is he able to do that?
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.780]   We have all these qualifications. He's above reproach.
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.780]   He's not pugnacious. He's temperate.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.780]   He's not a drunkard. He's a husband of one wife.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:37.780]   He's believing children and all this stuff that he says.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.780]   But when Paul singles out to Timothy,
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.780]   do not lay hands. Do not ordain somebody into ministry,
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.780]   especially if they are young believers.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.780]   And this is what he says.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.780]   "Not anoint a young convert so that he will not become conceited
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:57.780]   and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil."
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.780]   The primary concern, with all the other qualifications that are given,
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:05.780]   the primary concern that Paul points out about putting somebody in leadership,
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.780]   that he's going to become proud.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.780]   Because he's given some sort of honor.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.780]   He's given some sort of authority that it's going to get to his head.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:20.780]   And then once pride enters his head, he's going to be ruined.
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:25.780]   So he said, it doesn't mean that only young believers struggle with pride.
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.780]   But he said young believers haven't been tested.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.780]   They haven't been broken. They haven't been humbled.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.780]   And so when you give leadership to people who have not been broken,
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:41.780]   have not been humbled, haven't seen that he's not capable,
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.780]   that only God is, and he hasn't learned to be dependent on God,
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.780]   and you give him some authority, and then he bears a little bit of fruit,
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:52.780]   and it gets to his head, and he begins to say, "I will. I will. I will."
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:56.780]   And it destroys him.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:02.780]   We need to be aware of the active work of our enemy.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.780]   If we're going to fight in this spiritual battle,
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:10.780]   first thing I want to point out is the power of Satan.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.780]   He's powerful.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:18.780]   In Jude chapter 9, in verse 9, it says, "But Michael the archangel,"
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.780]   remember Michael the archangel? He is the chief of the angels.
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:25.780]   So if one angel is powerful, imagine the power of Archangel Michael.
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.780]   "Archangel Michael, when he disputed with the devil,
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:35.780]   and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment,
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.780]   but said, 'The Lord rebuke you.'"
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.780]   Archangel Michael, who is the most powerful of all the angels,
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:47.780]   he said he did not dare challenge the devil directly.
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.780]   He said, instead, he said, recognizing the power of the devil, he said,
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.780]   "The Lord rebuke you."
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:56.780]   Not by his might, not by his power.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:01.780]   So if Archangel Michael recognizes the power of the devil,
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:05.780]   where do you and I stand?
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:13.780]   You see how dangerous it is for us not to recognize what the enemy is capable of?
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:19.780]   In fact, when the enemy is very effective, you don't even know it.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:27.780]   You have thoughts, you have behavior, you have emotions,
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:32.780]   that the enemy has led you to, and you don't even know it.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:36.780]   Words come out of your mouth that may even be influenced by Satan,
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.780]   and you don't even know it.
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:44.780]   Because we don't recognize the power that is against us.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:52.780]   He is powerful, far beyond what you and I could possibly imagine.
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.780]   He desires to devour us.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.780]   1 Peter 5a, be of sober spirit.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.780]   Be alert.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:04.780]   It is not safe for Christians not to be sober,
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:07.780]   because not to be sober means you're not aware that you're in the middle of battle.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:12.780]   You have an enemy who wants to kill you, and you're not even aware of it.
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.780]   You're in the midst of that.
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:22.780]   The soldier who is in the middle of conflict and is not aware that he's being shot at is in the most danger.
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.780]   He doesn't hide. He doesn't grab his gun. He's not running.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:29.780]   He's just casually walking through while he's getting shot at.
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.780]   That's what he means, be sober.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.780]   Be sober in spirit. Be on the alert.
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:41.780]   Your adversary, another word for the devil, the enemy, prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.780]   seeking someone to devour.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.780]   The image of a roaring lion, most of us who grew up in the city,
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.780]   the closest thing that we've ever seen a lion is in a zoo.
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   Well fed, sitting on his stomach, and usually like, "Where's the lion? He's lazy. He's sleeping again."
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:03.780]   You know what's interesting was, years ago, I was sitting in front of our Indian pastors,
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.780]   and I asked them, knowing all the persecution, you know,
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:11.780]   and you guys remember several years ago, they were beaten up and left in the woods for dead.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.780]   And some ranger came in and basically saved them.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.780]   They were kind of left out there to be devoured by wild animals.
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.780]   And so I'm talking to them and said, "You know, of all the things that you guys experienced,
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:26.780]   what's the most difficult thing you've experienced in preaching the gospel in this very hostile area?"
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.780]   And they sat there and kind of think for a while, and they said,
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.780]   and they looked at each other and they said,
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:37.780]   "There was this one time we were going to this remote village,
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   and we thought we were going to get killed by a tiger.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.780]   So I thought they were joking, you know. It was like, 'Tiger?'
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:50.780]   And they said, 'Yeah, yeah, we were out in the open field, and we had to go through this long stretch,
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.780]   and then halfway through we saw up in the hill a tiger was walking down.'
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.780]   And they said, 'We're dead.'
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.780]   And so quickly they hid themselves behind this boulder that was in the middle,
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.780]   and if the tiger kept on coming the direction that it was headed, they said, 'We're done.'
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.780]   And by the grace of God, the tiger came and maybe sniffed something else in the wind
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:14.780]   and then took a left turn and went away and never recognized it."
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   And he said, "But if that tiger came our way, that would have been it."
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.780]   Of all the things that I thought they would say, that was not on any of my list.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   The tiger, the most scariest thing that you encounter were tigers.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:35.780]   He says, "Our enemy is like a roaring lion, a hungry lion, seeking someone to devour."
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:38.780]   He is not passively waiting for us to come.
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:41.780]   He's actively looking.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:47.780]   Actively looking at this powerful being that even Archangel Michael would not dare to pronounce judgment upon him.
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:53.780]   He says, "Our enemy, the devil, is roaring around like a roaring lion, wanting to devour who?
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:57:00.780]   Not just anybody. He's not going to devour his own. He's not going to devour those who follow him.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:04.780]   He's talking about us, Christians.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:10.780]   And that's why he says, 'Be sober. Look carefully.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:14.780]   Know that you are in the midst of a spiritual battle.'"
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:19.780]   Now, if I stop here and say, "Okay, you should be scared. Go home and lock your doors."
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.780]   You know what I mean? You better start fasting and praying.
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.780]   But the same Bible tells us in 1 John 4, 4,
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:35.780]   "You're from God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world."
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:42.780]   The reality of satanic powers around us, who is trying to devour us,
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.780]   we are protected by the Spirit of God.
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.780]   He who is in us is greater than he who is in the world.
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.780]   So is he saying, "Relax. Yeah, there's danger there, but you're protected.
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.780]   So continue to live your life in peace. Don't worry about it."
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.780]   No. The reason why he shared this is so that you would be sober.
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:06.780]   The reason that he shares that is that if you just kind of nonchalantly walk around in your life
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:11.780]   without recognizing that there is danger, unless what? You abide in me.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:17.780]   That the only one that can protect you from the enemy is the God who created him.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:27.780]   And outside of him, even Archangel Michael, even Archangel Michael said he wouldn't dare challenge him.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:34.780]   So the application of why this is presented to us is so that we would be sober.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.780]   That we are in enemy territory.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.780]   And it is clear when we get into that, when Satan offers all of these kingdoms,
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.780]   he wasn't just making this up.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:47.780]   He said that authority has been given to me, and I can give it to anybody that I desire.
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:51.780]   We are living in his territory. He's the God of this age.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:56.780]   He's the Prince of Darkness.
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   So for people who claim to be children of God, and not living day to day,
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:08.780]   realizing that we are in spiritual battle, that person is in grave danger.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:14.780]   It's no different than if you had two countries who are in conflict,
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.780]   and you have the uniform on, you have the soldier uniform on,
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:21.780]   but because you are not aware that there's a battle going on,
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:26.780]   and you put on the uniform of your side, and you walk into the enemy territory,
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:29.780]   just to grab some coffee.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.780]   Just get some rest.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:37.780]   And you're just walking around in enemy territory with your uniform on,
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:42.780]   not realizing everybody on that side wants to kill you.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:50.780]   And the only way that you would be safe is to be on the side where your general is protecting you.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:55.780]   And that's why there's so much of the Bible warns us about being lukewarm.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.780]   And drifting.
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.780]   Because it doesn't sound that dangerous to simply be lukewarm.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:06.780]   Lukewarm is kind of like, you know, it's neither hot nor cold.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.780]   You don't feel any danger. You're not going to get burned.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.780]   You're not going to get frostbite. Just lukewarm.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   Lukewarm basically is neither here nor there.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.780]   You just kind of put on the uniform.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:22.780]   You put on the uniform, and just walking around enemy territory.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.780]   And you're getting shot at, and you don't even know it.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.780]   And you have all kinds of problems that may be happening as a direct result of the enemy trying to trip you up,
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.780]   but you don't even recognize that there's a spiritual war going on.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.780]   Maybe if I tweaked it. Maybe if I moved my money around.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.780]   Maybe if I had this relationship. Maybe if I did that.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.780]   Maybe if we just manipulated the situation that the end result's going to be different.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:46.780]   Not recognizing that there's a spiritual attack.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.780]   This is why this is so important.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.780]   The enemy is smarter than us. More powerful than us.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:55.780]   He's more learned than us. He knows the Bible better than us.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.780]   Has more experience than us.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.780]   He's wiser than us.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:05.780]   And he's better looking than us.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:11.780]   In Matthew 10, 28-31 it says, "Do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:16.780]   But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both the soul and the body in hell.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:23.780]   Are not two sparrows sold for a cent, and yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.780]   But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.780]   So do not fear. You are more valuable than many sparrows."
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:37.780]   Now Satan is a powerful, wise being that comes to Jesus and tries to thwart Him through temptation.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.780]   But you know how Jesus overcomes?
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:47.780]   Because there's a greater fear of God than of the devil.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.780]   So as the devil comes, "If you do this, I will give you all of this."
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.780]   But he said, "But the word of God says."
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:02:01.780]   But God said this, "I cannot submit to you because I have one that I am more fearful than you."
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   If we're not living in awe and fear of the living God,
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.780]   you should be afraid of the other powers that are against you.
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:16.780]   You are not safe. That's what the Bible says.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.780]   By our own power, by our own might, we are not safe.
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:25.780]   And I'm not just talking physically. I'm talking even mentally.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:34.780]   All kinds of thoughts, all kinds of feelings can easily be manipulated. Remember?
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.780]   Judas was not a believer, so he completely just possessed him.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.780]   He wasn't just being influenced by it. He said he went into him.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:48.780]   But Peter, the head apostle, Satan manipulated his thoughts and his emotions.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.780]   Even though Jesus clearly said, "This is the reason why I came, so you must not go."
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:56.780]   And Jesus recognizes satanic influence on the apostle,
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.780]   his hand-picked leader among his disciples.
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:04.780]   He says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:10.780]   When we're not aware, and we allow all kinds of things to percolate in our hearts
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.780]   and not deal with it before God, basically he says,
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.780]   "Do not give room for the scheme of the devil."
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:18.780]   And he is scheming.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:23.780]   And the danger that we're in is when we do not recognize the scheming activity
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:28.780]   and we have no fear of God,
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.780]   automatically we think, "Well, we're safe."
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.780]   He says, "No."
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:38.780]   That's why he says, "Recognize that there is a spiritual battle going on."
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:45.780]   So the way, the primary way the devil tempts us and he devours us
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.780]   is by twisting the Word of God.
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:51.780]   It's not the only way, but that's a primary way that we've seen.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:55.780]   We've seen that in the Book of Genesis.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:59.780]   We've seen that in the false teachings that are coming in.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.780]   The primary problem all throughout church history has been false teaching.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.780]   Let me say this.
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   Matthew 24, 23 says, "At the end times, behold, there are going to be times when they say,
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:15.780]   'Behold, here is Christ. There he is. Do not believe him.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:21.780]   For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:26.780]   so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.'"
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:34.780]   Now, he says, "Are the elect, are they able, true elect, able to fall away from their faith?"
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.780]   No.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:40.780]   Even here it says, "But the delusion is going to be so powerful that even the elect, if possible,"
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:42.780]   meaning that it's not possible.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.780]   So what is he talking about?
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.780]   He's talking about people who look like the elect.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:52.780]   You're going to be surprised that that person, they were leaders.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:56.780]   They bore so much fruit. They were so gifted. They were so committed.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.780]   They were so hardworking.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.780]   They fell away?
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.780]   That's who he's referring to, somebody who looked, we all thought that they were elect,
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:08.780]   and because of their falling, they say, we realize, oh, they were not elect.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.780]   They left us because they were never really of us.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:11.780]   That's what he's referring to.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.780]   He said that's how strong the delusion is going to be.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:20.780]   And so the delusion is targeted to professing Christians.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:23.780]   Professing Christians, that's what he says.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.780]   And how does he do that?
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.780]   He twists the Word of God.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.780]   I mean, remember the Garden of Eden?
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:37.780]   He comes up and he shows up and he says, "He was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made,
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.780]   and he said to the woman, 'Indeed has God said you shall not eat from any tree?'"
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.780]   Has he really said that?
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.780]   Is that really in the Bible?
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:48.780]   "The woman said to the serpent, 'From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:55.780]   but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God said you shall not eat from it or touch it or you will die.'"
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:59.780]   And then Satan just straight up says, "You will not die."
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:02.780]   And just straight up, it's a father of lies.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:07.780]   He's perverting the Word of God to see if they're going to bite, and they bit.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.780]   Why did they bite?
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:14.780]   Because they looked at the tree and they said it looked like it was good for food, attractive to the eyes,
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.780]   and it was good to make one wise.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:22.780]   Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, also pride of life.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   It's not by accident that Jesus' temptation is food, first one.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:36.780]   And then the lust of the eyes where Satan takes him up to see all of his kingdom and showed him, right, lust of the eyes.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:40.780]   And then he said, "If you really are the Son of God, jump off this thing."
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.780]   Also pride of life, your identity, prove yourself.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.780]   It's not by accident. These things are connected.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:54.780]   I don't know how many times I would say something up in the pulpit and somebody would come to me and say,
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.780]   "Why are you twisting the Bible?"
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.780]   The Bible doesn't say that.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.780]   Something I say offended them.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:08.780]   There's a lot of things now in our culture that I'm going to say, because the culture has drifted so far away from God.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:14.780]   Even just a basic teaching of what the Word of God says, there's going to be some people who are affected by it.
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:18.780]   And everyone's going to say, "Oh, and usually when they challenge me, the way they challenge me is not,
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:23.780]   'I don't like it,' you know, because there's not a lot of authority.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:28.780]   Now usually the way I get challenged is, 'Why are you perverting the Word of God?'"
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:33.780]   And so I would normally push back, say, "Which part of the Bible am I perverting?
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.780]   Which passage are you looking at that I'm not interpreting correctly?
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:40.780]   What part?" And usually there's no answer.
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.780]   If you can correct me with the Word of God, I mean, I'm submitted to the Word of God.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.780]   I don't want to tell you my opinions. I should be corrected.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.780]   But I can't be corrected by your opinion, because it doesn't sit well with you,
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.780]   because you have certain prejudices that you have.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:58.780]   I have prejudices that I have to correct according to the Word of God.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:03.780]   Now let me, I'm going to save the rest for next week,
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:08.780]   but I'm going to, let me just share this with you, because I want you guys to be aware why
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.780]   the study of the Word of God is so important.
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:14.780]   Like, we didn't have so many things, you know, we could have been about missions,
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:18.780]   we could have been about, you know, outreach or homeless or social justice,
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:22.780]   but we just decided that our church, we're going to be about the Word of God.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:28.780]   That's not how we came to the conclusion. We came to the conclusion that we've drifted so far.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:32.780]   We've drifted so far from what the Word of God says. It doesn't even look the same.
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:37.780]   Read the Scriptures. Read the Scripture for yourself, and then compare what's going on today,
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:41.780]   what is being taught, what is being practiced. It doesn't even look the same.
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:47.780]   How can this be the same church? How can this be the same God that was handed down to us?
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:51.780]   It is not. And that's why we chose, we want whatever we do, whether it's prayer,
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:55.780]   whether it's evangelism, whether it's discipleship, whether it's helping the poor,
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:00.780]   whatever it is, we're going to do it biblically because of what we see in Scripture.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:05.780]   The reason why this is so important is because the primary way that Satan devours us
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:11.780]   is by taking maybe even good intentions and then twisting that just a little bit.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:18.780]   Years ago, I was on campus at UCI, and I was evangelizing, and I ran into these two young men.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:22.780]   And they said that they were evangelizing. And through our conversation,
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:28.780]   we found out that they were part of the local church in this area in Irvine.
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:33.780]   If you guys don't know what the local church is, the local church was started by the disciple of Watchman Nee,
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:42.780]   and his disciple's name was Witness Lee. So years ago, they used to be called the Witness Lees.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.780]   And I said, "Oh, you guys are part of the Witness Lees?"
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:47.780]   And they said, "No, no, we're not Witness Lees." I said, "But who founded it?"
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   They said, "Witness Lees." But they call themselves a local church.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:55.780]   And so we started talking, and we didn't get to end our conversation,
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:58.780]   but they were clearly engaged with me, and I was engaged with them,
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:01.780]   so they were excited that somebody that they met on the street wanted to talk to them.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.780]   They're probably used to getting rejected, and I'm used to getting rejected.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:09.780]   So these guys want to talk to me and found out that they were seminary students in Anaheim.
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:15.780]   They came from Texas, and they had 200 seminary students in their 20s that would come and get trained for two years,
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:19.780]   and then they would go. And they told me that they would do study in the morning,
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:26.780]   and they would be sent out to the campus, and they said there are 17 full-time seminary students that are just engaged at UCI.
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.780]   That was then. I don't know how many they have now, but I know that they're very active.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:35.780]   So we made an appointment and said, "Hey, let's get back together next week, and maybe we can talk."
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:41.780]   So this went on for about eight, nine months. Every Wednesday, I got together with them,
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:45.780]   and it took about four weeks to figure out exactly where we disagreed,
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.780]   because initially all they talked about, "You've got to be able to read the Bible."
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:52.780]   I said, "Yeah, me too." "But you've got to know really about the Bible." "Yeah, me too."
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.780]   They said, "No, no, no, no." And then they said, "You've got to read this Bible."
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   So they gave me the recovery Bible, and the recovery Bible has a little bit of the Bible,
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   and then the rest of it is like the study notes. But they really knew that Bible well.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.780]   I mean, they were being instructed every day for two hours in the morning and two hours at night.
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.780]   They were just studying the Bible, at least their recovery Bible.
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:18.780]   And then I came to where we actually disagreed, because I read online, or I read somewhere,
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:23.780]   and it said they were motorless, and they had believed that they needed to be baptized at the church,
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.780]   and it said they rejected all of that. That's not true.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:30.780]   But we did finally come to a place where we disagreed. And the main thing was,
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.780]   they said they believe that there's two separate kinds of Christians.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:41.780]   They said one set are Christians who profess, but they're not bearing fruit, like real fruit.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:46.780]   They're not on fire for God. So those Christians, when they die, they're going to pay for their sins.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:51.780]   And then the ones who are really committed and belong to the right church, which is them,
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:55.780]   the local church people, that when they die, they're going to enter into the millennium,
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:58.780]   and they're going to enjoy the presence of God and all of that.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.780]   So I said, "That sounds a lot like the purgatory that the Catholics believe in."
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:06.780]   They were immediately, "No, no, no, we don't believe in—it's not purgatory. It's different."
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:13.780]   They said, "So explain it to me." It's where Christians die to pay for their sins,
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:19.780]   and then when their sins are paid for, they come out, and then they can join the other Christians.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:23.780]   That's purgatory.
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:28.780]   But they just refused to be called—"We're not like the Catholics. We don't believe that."
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:34.780]   At the end of the day, "Okay, so I won't call it purgatory. I'll just say the place you go to pay for your sins."
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.780]   I said, "Where did you get that in the Bible?"
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:40.780]   So we landed on this text, 1 Corinthians 3, 12 through 15.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:46.780]   And so we realized that this was the primary text, and that they were using other texts to prove that.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:51.780]   So I spent almost seven months on this text with them, because they brought it up.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:58.780]   It's like, "You need to know that. You need to read the Bible. If you read this, how can you say that this is not what it says?"
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.780]   And he read, and let me read it for you.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:05.780]   "Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:11.780]   each man's work will become evident, for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire,
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.780]   and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:20.780]   If any man's work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:27.780]   And if any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as though through fire."
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:35.780]   So he was reading that. "Hey, see how it says, 'Your works will be tested, and if it doesn't, it will suffer loss.'"
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:42.780]   In other words, you're going to pay for these sins, and then you're going to come out and be saved at the end.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:47.780]   Interestingly enough, that's exactly—this is the proof text that the Catholics use.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.780]   Now they have other extra biblical material that they use, the Apocrypha,
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:55.780]   but this is for the Bible that we use, this is the text that they go to.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:58.780]   This proves purgatory.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.780]   So we're going back and forth, and you know, talking about this, and I asked him,
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:06.780]   "Do you think it's important that you understand the text within the context?
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.780]   Because this is a part of a larger letter that Paul wrote."
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.780]   And he said, "Of course we do."
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.780]   I said, "Do you know what he said before this text?"
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:19.780]   And he's like, "Don't know, so even though it's important—"
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:25.780]   So they would always look at the Recovery Bible, and they would quote the study notes in the Recovery Bible.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.780]   "But look what it says." He's like, "But that's not the Bible you're quoting. That's Witness Lee's writings.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.780]   Let's look at the Bible to see what it says."
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:40.780]   So like I said, I spent seven months with them going through passage by passage in 1, 2, 3, 4,
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.780]   and the ramification of that, how that's connected to the rest of the Bible.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:51.780]   And so I opened up with them in 1 Corinthians 3, 5-12, which is a text right before this is written.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:59.780]   "What then is Apollos, and what is Paul, servant through whom you believe, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one?"
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.780]   So for the sake of time, I won't read the whole thing.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:09.780]   But basically what happens prior to that text is Paul is addressing a problem that there's division in the church.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.780]   And this division is at the core of every other problem in 1 Corinthians.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:18.780]   It's because you're not united, saying, "We're Apollos, we're Peter, we're Paul, we're Jesus."
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:26.780]   And as a result of that, it created this division in the church, and this division led to all kinds of chaos in the church.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.780]   Paul was addressing that all the way from chapter 1 to chapter 3.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:33.780]   So chapter 3 is the conclusion of this argument.
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:39.780]   Now, in order to understand the problem of what's going on, you have to understand that there was tension in the church.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.780]   It was a legitimate tension.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.780]   In 1 Corinthians 16, 10, look what Paul says.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:50.780]   "Concerning Apollos, our brother, I encouraged him greatly to come to you with the brethren,
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:56.780]   and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity."
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:02.780]   Now, I'm not sure exactly how you read this in Greek, and I've read it in different translations, and it pretty much says the same thing.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:05.780]   Does that sound like Paul's a little bit frustrated?
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:09.780]   I read it. I know it's the Bible, but the Bible's honest.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:19.780]   Paul says, "I encouraged him greatly to come," and he says, "It was not at all Apollos' desire."
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:23.780]   Right? It sounds like to me there's something going on. There's some tension.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:28.780]   And I can understand why, because Apollos was not converted by Paul.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:34.780]   Apollos was the scholar who was expositing the Old Testament, and he's the one who connected the dots in the prophecies,
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:38.780]   and he came to the conclusion that the Messiah is going to be a suffering Messiah.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:44.780]   And Achilles and Priscilla brings him aside and say, "That Jesus, that Messiah you're preaching, already came."
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:51.780]   So he was the scholar, and he was the preacher. He was the one who was able to attract attention,
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:54.780]   exposit the text, and people were coming to him.
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:59.780]   Paul, remember what they say about him? They say, "Letters are strong, but his presence is weak."
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:02.780]   And his presence is talking about his ability to communicate.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.780]   In their Book of Acts, it said it was a habit of Paul to preach on and on and on.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:10.780]   He actually killed people with his sermons.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.780]   They fell asleep, and they fell off, and they died.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:17.780]   He was not a good communicator. He was an evangelist.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:21.780]   Apollos was the scholar. And so you could see, maybe there was a little bit of tension.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:25.780]   Then on top of that, remember Peter in the Book of Galatians?
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:31.780]   Understand, Galatians was written maybe a year before 1 Corinthians was written.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.780]   So it was written around the same time.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:37.780]   Remember what Paul did in Galatians? He writes, he said, "I'm not serving man.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:42.780]   If anybody comes to you, preaches the gospel, other than what I preach to you, let him be anathema."
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:45.780]   The highest and the most critical judgment be upon him.
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:50.780]   And then he says, "I had to confront Peter. I had to embarrass Peter in front of everybody
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:54.780]   because he was confusing the gospel. He would not sit with the Gentiles.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:58.780]   And it was confusing that you have to be a Jew in order to become a Christian,
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.780]   and that needed to be corrected."
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.780]   And they say, "He publicly rebukes Peter."
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.780]   And then on top of that, not only rebukes Peter,
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:12.780]   if you read the text, it says, "And also Barnabas."
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:17.780]   That's what it says, "And Barnabas also got caught up into this mess."
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.780]   Now you would think, humanly speaking, right?
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.780]   I mean, Peter, the leader among the apostles, would say, "Who's this guy?
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:30.780]   This guy used to kill people, and now he's going to embarrass me?"
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.780]   You would think if, humanly speaking, if this played out,
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:38.780]   you would have had the Church of Paul, Church of Peter, and Church of Apollos.
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:41.780]   And we would have had 2,000 years of different history.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:46.780]   1 Corinthians is written right around the time that Galatians was happening,
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:50.780]   and so my guess is there was some human tension in them.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:52.780]   And it took a while for Peter maybe to come around.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:57.780]   By the time he writes his letters, he says, "No, I was wrong. Peter was right."
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:02.780]   Peter was humble enough to accept his rebuke, and so they continued to spread the same gospel.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:05.780]   But this is what's going on in Corinthians.
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.780]   The Church was divided.
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.780]   "No, Peter is right. No, Apollos is right. No, Paul is right."
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.780]   It's in that context that he is writing this, because the churches were divided,
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:20.780]   saying, "You've missed the mark. If you allow Satan to divide us because of this,
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.780]   Satan has won. Have you forgotten?"
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:26.780]   And so in 1 Corinthians 3.10, it says, "According to the grace of God,
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.780]   which was given to me, like a wise master, builder, I laid a foundation.
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:32.780]   Another is building on it, which would be Apollos.
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:35.780]   But each man must be careful how he builds on it,
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:40.780]   for no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:48.780]   So 1 Corinthians 3.12-15 is basically an explanation of the division that's taking place,
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:54.780]   that each one, Paul, Peter, Apollos, that ultimately God's going to test what they're doing.
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:58.780]   That if what they're doing is wrong, God's going to test them.
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:02.780]   They will be saved, but their work is going to be tested.
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:07.780]   So the point that he's trying to make is, do not divide over this.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:14.780]   That's why Paul says, "When I was with you, I resolved to know nothing but Christ crucified."
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:20.780]   The Jews look for signs. The Greeks look for wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:24.780]   It is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is the power of God to those who are being saved.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:31.780]   So the point that he was trying to make is, fixate yourself on Christ.
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:35.780]   Do not turn from it to the left or to the right.
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.780]   In season and out of season, you stick with the Word of God,
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:50.780]   because God has ordained not your organization, not your intellect, not your will, not the program,
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:52.780]   but God has ordained the Word of God.
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:57.780]   The foolishness of the Word of God being preached, that it may seem foolishness,
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:05.780]   it may seem that it doesn't have power, but God has ordained it in order to dumbfound the wise,
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:09.780]   the people who think that they know, that they would dumbfound them to recognize
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:13.780]   that what God was doing was more than powerful.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:15.780]   It is the greatest wisdom.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.780]   That's the point of 1 Corinthians.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:23.780]   That because you have strayed from that, it is causing all kinds of divisions in the church.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.780]   So it is not about purgatory.
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:30.780]   I wanted to share this with you because many, many instances of this has happened since,
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:35.780]   other than this. It was that this was very clear to me.
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:43.780]   So much of false teaching and people who fall out is because they have some Bible.
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:47.780]   They have some of it, but they do not have all of it.
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:53.780]   So when Satan plants seeds, when Peter was trying to get Jesus to not go to the cross,
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:59.780]   Peter did not say, "I don't want God. Let's rebel together." He didn't say that.
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:07.780]   He used his love. "I love you, Jesus. Even if they all fall, I will not fall."
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:14.780]   Satan tapped into his loyalty. Satan tapped into his love to thwart what God came to,
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:18.780]   what Jesus came to do.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:29.780]   So if Peter's maybe good intention can be manipulated by Satan to be used against the gospel,
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:39.780]   how important is it that you and I do not turn from the Word of God to the left or to the right?
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:44.780]   How important is it that you and I stay sober spiritually?
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:49.780]   How important is it that we do not just simply have a superficial grasp of the Word of God,
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:55.780]   but that we would also say, "You say this, but God says this."
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:01.780]   My goal this morning was simply to plant seeds in your head that not only this morning,
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:05.780]   but that we are all aware.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:10.780]   Not simply because the news says, "Oh, we have a gunman out there who's trying to shoot us,
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:17.780]   so you should be careful." No, even without a gunman, the danger is real and constant.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:19.780]   We need to be sober.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:25.780]   We need to make sure that we understand that we are soldiers in enemy territory.
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.780]   We are not home.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:32.780]   That we are going through, one day we will be home with the Lord,
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:39.780]   and to live our lives fully being aware that our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:43.780]   but against the devil and his demons.
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:48.780]   Let's pray together.
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:54.780]   Heavenly Father, we pray for revival.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:24:01.780]   We pray, Father God, that you would give us the conviction to abide in you.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:09.780]   Not simply because we want to bear fruit, although that's what you warned us,
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:12.780]   but because we need you. We need you to be our refuge.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:14.780]   We need you to give us clear mind.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:19.780]   We need you to purify our hearts, to open our ears,
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:23.780]   that in the midst of storm, Lord God, that we would not run to the world,
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:26.780]   but to you and you alone.
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:30.780]   Help us, Lord, to be aware of the spiritual attack that we're under.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.780]   That we may withstand the scheme of the devil.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.780]   That we may honor you, Father God, in spirit and in truth.
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:40.780]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.780]   All right, so we're going to ask the pastors to come up,
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:44.780]   and I'm going to open up the communion table.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.780]   So this is the way it's going to go.
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:50.780]   There's going to be four stations. There's one here, two here, and one there.
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.780]   We're going to ask the two side groups to come alongside,
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.780]   and then take it and go down that way.
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.780]   We're going to ask the two sides in the middle to come on this side,
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.780]   and then take it down the middle.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.780]   If you happen to be right here up in the front,
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.780]   obviously you can come to the front and get it.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:06.780]   But for all of you, if you can, to do that.
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:10.780]   Also, if for whatever reason, as you're in line,
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:14.780]   you see that there's other lines that are completely open,
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:17.780]   yeah, you don't have to be Asian. You can break out of that line.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:22.780]   You know, come on the shorter line, so that the lines will go a little bit faster.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:27.780]   So I'm going to read the text and open up the communion table.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.780]   And I want to explain to you why we want you to come,
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.780]   instead of us just giving it to you.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:36.780]   And there's nothing wrong with that, but the reasoning behind what we're doing is
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.780]   we want you to be intentional about coming up.
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:41.780]   We don't want you participating in the communion,
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.780]   and somebody just dropped it up and opened your mouth and put it in,
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:46.780]   and there's not a lot of thought and intention behind it.
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.780]   So we want you to contemplate, to think, to pray.
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:52.780]   If there's any sins, to confess, to confess.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.780]   If there's anything that you need to come before the Lord and acknowledge,
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:58.780]   to acknowledge and to be prayerful, so that when you are ready,
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:01.780]   you are willfully coming to the table.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:05.780]   So again, I want to remind you, the communion table is for baptized Christians,
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:10.780]   because it is a ceremony celebrating our union with Christ.
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:14.780]   So if there was no union to begin with, obviously there's no power behind it.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.780]   So we ask you to stay in your seats.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:22.780]   But for the rest of you, when you come up, again, one by one, come up intentionally.
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:25.780]   So let me open it up for us.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.780]   In 1 Corinthians 11, 23, it says,
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:30.780]   "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you,
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:34.780]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:36.780]   And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:40.780]   'This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.'
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.780]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper, saying,
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.780]   'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:49.780]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.'"
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:52.780]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would anoint this sacred time.
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:55.780]   May it be used, Lord God, to sanctify your church,
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:59.780]   to cause us, Lord God, to reflect deeply upon the body of Christ,
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:03.780]   that this would cause us, Lord, to reflect on the grace
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:07.780]   and to celebrate your sacrifice for us.
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:11.780]   Lord, we do not participate it by our own merit.
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.780]   We do not participate because we did not sin this week.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:19.780]   But knowing, Father God, in our weakness, that Christ came and suffered on our behalf,
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:24.780]   that he who knew no sin became sin so that we may become the righteousness of God.
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.780]   So help us to come to this table recognizing the body,
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:31.780]   recognizing you, that it would cause your church to be sanctified.
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.780]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:38.780]   Again, one by one, as you are ready, we invite you to come.
