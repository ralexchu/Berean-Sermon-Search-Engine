[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   All right, thank you, David, for that testimony.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:15.800]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, we're in verse 1 to 3, and we're
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.040]   going to be here for a few more weeks.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.840]   Yeah, so as I've been preparing, there's some stuff that I just didn't want to skim
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840]   through.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.220]   I wanted to take some time, and we don't have a timeline where we have to finish this by
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.980]   a certain date, so we're just going to go as the Word of God is being revealed.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.400]   And I didn't even get through the whole Sermon for Service, so we'll see how long this takes.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400]   Verse 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.600]   So let me read this, and we'll jump in.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.820]   "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.840]   aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.960]   endurance the race that is set before us.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.180]   Fixing our eyes on Jesus the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before him endured
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.860]   the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.580]   For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself, so that you will
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.820]   not grow weary and lose heart."
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.820]   Let's pray.
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:23.020]   Heavenly Father, we give this time to you, asking for a clear understanding of your Word,
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.260]   that you would search us and know us and see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.720]   Lord, give us strength to understand.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.240]   Give us strength to persevere.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.580]   And we pray, Father God, that your grace truly would be enough.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.480]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.040]   You know, as we travel for various reasons, whether you go to Asia or go to India or Africa,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.360]   you know, there are some countries where, you know, like 15, 20 years ago, you don't
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.720]   see anything Western, but you can see it developing.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.160]   And one of the things, signs that you see developing is you see more and more of the
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.240]   Western stuff coming in.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.760]   So, you know, 30 years ago, I would say, what, 20, 30 years ago, when we would go overseas,
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.360]   you know, we can tell if there was any kind of Western influence by looking at McDonald's,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.360]   right?
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.600]   And you go to McDonald's and you see, it's like, oh, there's a Western influence coming
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.120]   in, you know?
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.680]   And now, I think in the last 15 years, it's switched from McDonald's to Starbucks.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   You can tell the progress or the economy getting better because you see more and more Starbucks.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.200]   And we saw that out in Beijing and we started to see that out in India.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   Each time we go, there's more and more Starbucks, just like here.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.240]   You can run into it everywhere you go.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.840]   I remember when Starbucks was first coming in.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.320]   Some of you guys are a little bit older, remember, you know, that period when it was coming in.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.360]   I was thinking, like, how is this business going to take off?
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.080]   You know, coffee has been around forever and all they're selling is coffee.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.160]   You know, I know that since then, they've added like donuts and all this other stuff,
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.840]   but it was just coffee.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.760]   So, I said, these guys are crazy.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.920]   They're going to do a business just selling coffee.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.640]   And obviously, since then, I mean, it's one of the fastest growing companies, at least
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.440]   in the restaurant markets and coffee business.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.240]   And I realized that, you know, part of the reason why coffee, not just Starbucks, but
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.640]   coffee has taken off is because we become addicted not just to the flavor, but to the
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   caffeine.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.680]   You know, we're all fatigued and tired.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.960]   And so, I remember growing up, we didn't really drink much coffee.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   I didn't start drinking coffee until I was probably about 31 or 32 years old.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.320]   And the reason why was because I started to teach ESL to Korean grandparents.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.040]   And if I wasn't on my game, you know, I would lose them.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.560]   Their attention span wasn't that great.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.120]   So, I was speaking, you know, I had to speak to them in English and Korean.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.640]   And so, my mind had to be alert all the time.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.640]   And so, you know, the best way to describe it is kind of giving five-hour sermons five
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.200]   times a week.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   That's how it felt.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   Like standing there just draining.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.240]   I have to constantly think about, you know, what to teach them.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   Do they remember this?
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240]   What's the next lesson?
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.680]   And who's paying attention?
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   Who gets it?
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   Who doesn't get it?
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   And so, I remember thinking, wow, this is exhausting being a teacher.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.600]   And this is what the teachers must go through watching kids.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.760]   So, I started drinking coffee.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.880]   And now, it's become such a habit.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.880]   Like, you know, whether I need it or not, I have to drink coffee.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   And then, if I'm tired during the day, I would drink another cup of coffee.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.600]   I try not to drink more than one coffee.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.920]   But, you know, it's become such a habit now.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.640]   I mean, it's just, obviously, it's not just me.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.360]   All through the world now, caffeine is kind of what's keeping people going, right?
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.920]   Well, there's a lot of things that we do.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.520]   When we feel physically fatigued, maybe just go exercise, right?
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.240]   Maybe drinking energy drinks or soda, whatever it may be, or just take a walk.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.480]   When we're physically fatigued, put caffeine in, do something so that you can be alert
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.320]   and you can go back to work.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.720]   But what do you do when you're spiritually fatigued?
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   What do you do when you feel like the energy has been sapped down and you don't have the
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.600]   energy to continue on on this path?
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.680]   Where do you turn for that?
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.560]   Because caffeine might be able to give you a little perk and get you alert to be able
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.280]   to do what you need to do.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   But when you have spiritually been fatigued and you don't have the energy to persevere
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.240]   and continue, who do we turn to?
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.840]   How do we get energized?
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.000]   So the text that we're looking at in verse 1, in conclusion, the transition that's being
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.880]   made is in conclusion to Christalia.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.840]   Everything that's been presented is therefore, let us run this race with endurance.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.440]   And that's the imperative in this passage.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.720]   And that's what he's going to be talking about in the next two chapters.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.680]   And every verse is going to be running this race with endurance.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.120]   Well, how do we do that?
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.360]   He's not simply saying, just dig deep within yourself.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.620]   Just find strength within yourself and just be determined to get this right.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.620]   That's not what he is saying.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.880]   If any of you, for any period of time, walked with God with that intention, we're just going
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.240]   to be more disciplined than I was before.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.800]   I'm going to memorize more scripture than I'm going to pray more than other, I'm going
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.720]   to evangelize more than any other person.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.160]   Eventually, you get fatigued, you get tired, and you just don't have that energy.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.200]   And then if you keep living this cycle over and over again, that's what...and then we
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.720]   use the term being burnt out.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:34.080]   He's not simply calling us to be more determined, to be more disciplined, to be more sacrificial.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.800]   He says, we're talking about...he says that the imperative is let's run this race with
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   endurance.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.640]   And he talked about how we need to look first and foremost, are we committed to this race?
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   Are we in this race, this race before us?
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.780]   And then to look behind the cloud of witnesses that have gone, how they did it, what caused
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.400]   them to persevere to the end?
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.320]   And then last week, we looked at to look within.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.340]   Is there anything that I'm doing that is entangling me to hinder this race?
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.680]   What am I engaged in that causes me not to have this appetite for Christ?
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.440]   What are the sins that so easily clings, that we just kind of dismiss and say, well, everybody
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.120]   struggles with it, and then we allow it in our lives without genuinely fighting it.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.240]   And then the part that we're at this morning is finally, and this really is the main point,
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.280]   the crux of the issue.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.480]   Without this, everything else just becomes more things that we need to do, right?
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.600]   He says to look up, fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of the faith.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.920]   And then verse 3, it says, "For consider him who endures us hostility towards sinners against
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.760]   himself."
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:58.720]   If we don't get this, if we don't practice this, church can easily become a place where
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.480]   week after week, you're being reminded what you're not doing.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   You're not doing enough.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.240]   You know, I mean, probably the most tired people in the world are mothers with small
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   children at home, right?
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   You're fatigued.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.320]   24/7, you're giving to small children.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.360]   And then you come to church, you need to be more involved.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.400]   You need to be more giving.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   You need to be more sacrificial.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   Pick up your cross.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.000]   Jesus did this for you.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.040]   Why can't you do this for him?
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.260]   So no matter how nicely and graciously I say it, that's what gets into your ear.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.020]   And then just, you know, life is hard enough as it is, but you end up just piling up week
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.960]   after week this burden of what I should be doing that I'm not doing.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.040]   And if you've been there for a long time, this just is kind of piled up.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.680]   So you end up just kind of sucking it up.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.720]   I'm a Christian, so what else am I going to do?
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.120]   He's not simply saying, "Be more disciplined."
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.960]   He's not simply saying, "Be more determined."
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.080]   Although those are things that he does call us to do.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.560]   He says, "In order to be fueled, the ultimate fuel," he says, "to fix our eyes on Jesus."
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.920]   Some of your translations simply says, "Look to Jesus."
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.480]   The word there in Greek is much more intense.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.800]   It's much more precise.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   He's not simply saying just to casually look.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.600]   Look at the stars or look at these chairs.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:29.080]   The reason why in the ESV or the NASV it uses the word "fix" is because it has this meaning
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.040]   of laser focus.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:38.240]   To make a determination, you're intensely looking at something.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.920]   This word for looking or to fix our eyes on Jesus, and he said there's two reasons for
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.900]   that, because he's the author and he's the finisher of the rate, perfecter of the faith.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:54.360]   Not only is he the one that we are justified by, he's also the one who will sanctify us.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:00.000]   Again, if we're not careful, we get justified by Christ, and then the sanctification is
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.320]   just discipleship.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.760]   Just hook them up with somebody who's more mature, and then just kind of through learning
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.040]   and telling and discipleship that that's going to happen.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.160]   Justification we're completely helpless, but sanctification it's 100% us.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.680]   He said, "No, Jesus Christ is the author, and he, Jesus Christ, is also the perfecter
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.200]   of our faith who will bring us into completion."
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.520]   That's what Paul says when he says Philippians 1.6, "He who began a good work in you, he
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.320]   will carry it onto completion, onto the day of Christ."
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.360]   Now, that does not mean that human effort is not there.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.280]   That does not mean that God doesn't call us to discipleship and pick up the cross.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:49.560]   But in the end, the fuel that causes us to continue and to persevere is Christ himself.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.060]   To look intensely at Jesus.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.600]   It has two specific meanings in application.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:04.840]   One, the word to look, to fix, has the idea of gawking at something, to behold something.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.080]   You ever experience something where something is so great, whether you travel somewhere
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.400]   or maybe you see movies, people standing in front of Grand Canyon, just they can't take
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.200]   their eyes off of Grand Canyon.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.920]   I remember as a young child when my family decided to move from Philadelphia to Kansas,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.720]   my parents would stop by at Niagara Falls.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.600]   I probably was about 10 or 11 years old at that time.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:37.420]   I remember so vividly standing in front of Niagara Falls just being awed, even as a child.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.800]   Just the waterfall, it just looked so amazing.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.960]   Even though it was a brief time, even though I was a young child, that made a deep impression.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.440]   I remember a few years ago, we went back to look at it and it just didn't look as high.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.360]   Things that you look at when you're a child, when you go back as an adult, it just doesn't
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.040]   live up to your memory.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.960]   I think part of the reason was obviously I'm older, but the other part of it is I've seen
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.440]   other things.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.680]   I remember going to Kenya and this remote part of Kenya, we were at a waterfall.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.160]   We drove probably about four hours to get there, but once we got there, there was a
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.720]   waterfall that probably was about three times that height.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.520]   I remember looking at this like, "Wow, this makes Niagara Falls look tiny."
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.720]   The point of my story is there's things that we look at that just by the sheer magnitude
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.960]   of what you're seeing causes you to gaze at something, to gawk at something.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.400]   It may not just be scenery.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.640]   It could be something or someone, maybe someone so talented that it causes you to look at
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   it and gaze at it.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.200]   I remember, again, some of you guys are a little bit older.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:50.520]   Everything I say may be a little bit outdated, but do you know who Whitney Houston is?
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   You do?
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   Okay, good.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.640]   I'm connecting with a few of you.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.720]   I remember the first time hearing Whitney Houston sing that song, "I Will Always Love
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   You."
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   Remember?
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   I had to look it up.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   It was from the movie Bodyguard.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   I don't know.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:09.000]   I don't remember what year this was.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.320]   I wasn't that old, but I remember listening to that song and saying, "I never heard somebody
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.160]   hit a note that high before."
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160]   I was just amazed.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.280]   It just made a deep impression.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.320]   This idea of gawking and looking and beholding is something beyond you, is so beyond you,
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   so magnificent.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.760]   You can scenery, you can be talent, whether it's sports, whatever it is, it just naturally
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.080]   causes you to worship.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.380]   That's the word here, to behold.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:47.400]   In 1 John 3, verse 1, in the NASB, it says, "See how great a love the Father has bestowed
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   on us."
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.600]   In 1 John 3, verse 15, James, the literal understanding, it says to behold.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.400]   Look intently how great a love the Father has bestowed on us that we would be called
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.880]   children of God and such we are.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:11.920]   That sinners like us, rebellious sinners like us, behold, gawk at, fix your eyes, that we
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.680]   would become children of God.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.480]   That's the idea behind fixing your eyes upon Christ, not just to casually look, not just
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:26.320]   to consider, but to think deeply about what it is that we have.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.800]   Part of the reason why there is such superficiality in the way that we live our life is because
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.000]   we have such superficial understanding of the gospel.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.080]   Especially if you've grown up in the church and you heard the gospel in Sunday school
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.280]   and you say, "Yeah, I believe that.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.280]   What is the gospel?
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   I'm a sinner.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:51.120]   Jesus came, died for us and he was crucified, resurrected on my behalf and now I go to heaven."
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.200]   But then we've never seriously asked that question.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:01.440]   In fact, if you don't evangelize, you have no idea how many holes there are in your understanding
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.160]   of the gospel because you've never been tested.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.320]   No one's ever pushed back.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.000]   So you never ask the question, "Oh, Jesus loved me.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.880]   This I know for the Bible tells me so, the end."
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.080]   Then somebody say, "Why does he have to die?"
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.080]   Because I'm a sinner.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.640]   But why die?
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:29.000]   All the mothers in this room, future mothers, we all know that we love our kids and that's
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   why we have Mother's Day, Father's Day.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.400]   You don't tell your kids, "I loved you so much, I died for you."
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.840]   What does that mean?
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.280]   In fact, "I loved you so much, I'm going to bleed for you now."
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.680]   You don't bleed and then take the blood.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.240]   "I love you so much."
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.520]   What is that?
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.280]   But sometimes we hear it so much, we just accept it without really asking what that
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.520]   sounds like, not truly understanding the meaning behind any of this stuff.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.240]   Why did he have to be crucified?
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.160]   Why does he have to die and then resurrect again?
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.200]   What does all that mean?
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.080]   But we just heard it and we have a superficial understanding, superficial appreciation of
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.640]   what we sing about and learn about and even share.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.720]   But because we haven't gazed, we haven't beheld and actually wrestled with what it
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.400]   is that we actually have, we just kind of, "Oh, Jesus loves me, so he died for me, so
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.160]   now I got to go work.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.160]   Tell me what to do.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.480]   I'm going to go make disciples of all the nations."
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.680]   And so we're given to work, we work hard, we sacrifice, but there is no beholding in
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   our hearts.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:44.000]   And as a result of that, we labor, we strive, we sacrifice, and then we get burnt out.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.520]   And then we labor, we strive, we get burnt out, and then something else happens, we get
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.240]   encouraged and we get back up in this cycle over and over again.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.760]   And if that's the cycle that you've been in four years, five years, 10 years, 20 years,
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.720]   something inside of you just dies, that you don't have hope anymore, that this is not
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:10.600]   going to work, this hard work doesn't lead to anything.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.800]   The problem was not that we worked hard.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.560]   The problem wasn't that we didn't work hard enough.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:27.340]   The problem was the fuel that we need to cause all these things to happen wasn't happening.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.820]   And that's what he says to behold.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.720]   First we need to run this race with endurance.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.560]   And he says to behold, fix your eyes on Jesus.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:42.440]   Ephesians 3.16-19, Paul's prayer after laying about how he predestined us, he elected us,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.160]   he adopted us from before the creation of the world, and he's just basically laying
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.380]   out how he loved us and saved us.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.080]   And then he says, after telling them this, he says, he prays that he would grant you,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.640]   God would grant you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.480]   through the spirit in the inner man, so that Christ would dwell in your hearts through
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.680]   faith and that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   the saints.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.360]   All right, let me stop right there.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.880]   There is a difference between revelation and illumination.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.040]   Revelation, anybody can have it at any time.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.320]   Open up the Bible, read what it says, and then regurgitate that to other people.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.180]   That's revelation, right?
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.080]   That just requires your effort.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.020]   Working hard, memorize scripture, right?
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.200]   That's revelation.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.520]   He's not talking about revelation, because revelation was already given to them, right?
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.680]   He already gave it to them.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.240]   So when he says to comprehend what it is that you have been given, he's not simply talking
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.660]   about having a better or higher IQ or putting more effort into this.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.960]   He's talking that the Holy Spirit would take what was revealed to you so that you would
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:59.320]   open your eyes to see with all the saints the breadth, the length, the height, and the
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.720]   depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses all knowledge that you may be filled
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.580]   up to all the fullness of God.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:14.800]   That beyond revelation, that God through the Holy Spirit would illuminate you, that you
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.840]   would begin to behold what it is that you have.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:27.160]   And in this beholding is what fuels everything else that happens.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:33.400]   You know, I think many of you already know that I'm a cynic by nature, right?
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   And especially now where you have Yelp, you know, I know we have a generation where you
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.880]   have five stars and we got to go, right?
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.240]   I don't trust any of it, right?
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.240]   I've gone to some of these five-star coffee shops, five-star boba shops, five-star sushi
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.880]   shops and I can't think of a single time where I came back and was like, "That deserves
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.120]   five stars," right?
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.080]   It just never lives up to the hype, right?
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.600]   And part of the reason why it doesn't live up to the hype is because that experience
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.360]   you had, you know, may have been that one person that was there.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.400]   Maybe the person was making that particular sandwich did a great job.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.080]   And maybe you have a different kind of taste bud than I do and you like something spicy.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.840]   Maybe I don't like something spicy.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   It may have been you were with a group of friends and it wasn't just about the food
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.480]   but the environment that you were.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.760]   There's a lot of things that go into somebody just having a good time.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.920]   They've marketed that thing well.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.800]   So when I go there and I specifically eat that, I really get excited.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.000]   And part of the reason is I'm not a good person, right?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.680]   Part of the reason I'm a cynic by nature, I just don't trust these things.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.400]   And I tasted part of the reason why is because I've traveled a lot and I've eaten a lot of
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   things.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:50.440]   And so when I compare it to all of these things, it just never lives up to the hype, right?
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.960]   And even Niagara Falls, I told you, I was so awed by it.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.600]   And so second time I went, I was expecting, "Man, we're going to go see Niagara Falls."
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:04.840]   And I remember going there and saying, "Huh, there's a lot of water just falling."
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.600]   It just didn't live up to that hype, right?
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.720]   No matter what it is.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.640]   And that's true whether it is scenery, whether you travel, whether it is food, it's like
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.000]   that even with people.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.680]   It just doesn't live up to the hype.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.640]   So when I read biographies of people, I'm always thinking behind my head, "What is he
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   really like?"
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.160]   I know this is what they're saying about him, but what is he really like, right?
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.960]   That's why it's hard for me to get excited.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:42.480]   But I can tell you with all honesty that over 40 years, it's almost 40, I forget how many
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.880]   years, right?
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.240]   Almost 40 years.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:57.440]   Almost 40 years that I've been a Christian, that the love of Christ is far deeper than
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.360]   I realized 40 years ago.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.160]   It is far wider than what I remembered when I first met him.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:13.320]   It is far higher than I could possibly explain.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.400]   Nothing in this world lives up to that hype but the love of Christ.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.640]   And I remember Corrie Tamboon, again, this is one of these things that I remember so
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.640]   much, and I know I shared it before, but I remember Corrie Tamboon, some of you guys
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.280]   who know her, she's the author of the book, The Hiding Place, and it's her testimony about
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.160]   how her whole family got slaughtered during the Holocaust.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.960]   And then she became an evangelist.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.200]   And how before she became famous and was able to pay her bills, she said she used to sell
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.080]   watches.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.480]   And after she would make a good sale, she would walk away from that, said always feeling
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.080]   bad about the sale.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.220]   And the reason why was that it would bother her conscience that she had to hype up the
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.880]   watch in order to get the sale.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.360]   This watch is great, it's a great price, it's not going to let you down, and so she sold
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   it.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.560]   But even though she was a great salesperson, she would walk away always feeling guilty
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.640]   that maybe I wasn't fully honest.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.680]   And then she became an evangelist and she began to share the testimony about Jesus Christ.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.500]   And she would walk away with the same guilt but for a completely different reason.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.480]   And she would share how no matter how much she would share about Jesus, she would walk
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:31.200]   away thinking that maybe I didn't do God's love justice.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.160]   Maybe I didn't do justice to his grace.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:41.760]   There's nothing in this world that if we gawk at it long enough does not fade.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.320]   There's no food, there's no place, there's no human being that you will put on a pedestal
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:54.440]   and watch and behold where as time passes that it becomes greater than last year and
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.840]   greater than that the year after that.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:04.000]   Nothing in creation lives up to that kind of scrutiny except Christ.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.080]   That's why when he says to behold, to look, to gawk at.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:17.880]   Because where our fuel comes from is knowing the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:24.960]   You and I do not have the inner ability to just simply say no to temptation.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:31.600]   When we're tempted by things, tempted by hatred and anger, to simply say no because we're
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.200]   strong, because we're disciplined.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.360]   You and I do not have that ability.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:45.480]   So without beholding who Christ is, all Christianity becomes is more things that you're not doing
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.400]   right.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.280]   C.S. Lewis says this in his book, The Weight of Glory.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:58.320]   It would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.680]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.080]   joy is offered us.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.360]   Like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:18.960]   imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea, we are far too easily pleased.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.840]   He's describing an individual who gazed at, maybe have a glimpse of his glory, and then
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:32.880]   spent the rest of his life gawking at the world, being tempted, constantly distracted.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.640]   And we're so easily pleased, easily pleased with food, easily pleased with travel, easily
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.820]   pleased with circumstance.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.640]   And that's what causes us to drift.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.680]   So no wonder Christianity becomes a burden.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:53.280]   You know, we take our Christianity as a pick up your cross, deny yourself.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.520]   Jesus loved you so much.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.080]   How could you not do that for him?
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.240]   And we live this burden that we owe him.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.640]   And so we have to keep doing more of this.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.560]   And of course, we run empty.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.620]   You know, it says in Matthew 13 to 44 to 46, it says, "The kingdom of heaven is like a
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.440]   treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.400]   And from joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:26.300]   You notice here the motivation behind why he's selling all of this stuff?
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:32.380]   Because he recognized the value of the treasure that he found.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.960]   And so when he sacrifices, he's giving up everything, what does he do?
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.360]   You say, "Oh my God, that's so expensive.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.480]   I got to give up all of this so I can have that?"
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:48.040]   He says, "From joy over it."
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.280]   Because he saw the value.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.880]   And so everything that he had was worth selling and in joy sold everything so that he can
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.160]   have this.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:06.920]   See, the difference between an individual who is struggling to sacrifice and discipline
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   versus somebody who is eager to follow is how he recognizes the treasure in Christ.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.720]   If Christ is not the treasure, you will not overcome the temptation.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.080]   How can you when everybody around you is going after that?
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.620]   It's so nice, especially where you and I live.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:37.280]   We live 15 minutes away from the beach, 30 minutes, 40 minutes if you drive fast to the
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.400]   mountains, Disneyland over here, Knott's Berry Farm.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.860]   What else is down there?
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.440]   Movie theaters, all the food that we...
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.000]   You know one thing, the more I travel, the more I know that this is the best place in
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.600]   the world.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.840]   Even the food tastes better here.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.360]   Everything, we have access to pretty much everything.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.040]   I literally never need to leave Irvine.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.080]   Everything that I fleshly desire is in Irvine.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.040]   How are you going to win over that temptation?
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.940]   Simply by saying no?
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.440]   Simply by being more disciplined?
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.120]   Simply by having accountability group to shame you if you don't?
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.440]   You and I don't have that power.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:33.200]   He says because he saw the treasure of what he had, he didn't want to lose it.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.880]   So for joy of having that, he was willing to sell everything to get that.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:46.040]   See, if we're not beholding Christ and do not understand the breadth, length, height,
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:52.960]   and depth of the love of Christ, it just becomes more work.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.960]   More work.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:59.560]   Life is hard enough as it is, and then you go to the church, and you got to do more work.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.640]   That's why he says to fix your eyes on Jesus.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.880]   To fix it, not just to look at it, not just casually think about it.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.360]   He says to fix, don't take your eyes off of it.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.240]   That's what that means.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.920]   Because the moment we forget the treasure that we have in Christ, we easily get entangled
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.640]   and fall into temptation.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.800]   That's exactly what Apostle Paul meant in comparison to the surpassing knowledge of
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.400]   knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.160]   Surpassing knowledge meaning this is beyond just revelation, beyond me telling you.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.000]   This is beyond anything that the world can offer you.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.360]   Surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.960]   Everything else became rubbish.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:44.680]   Roman citizen, wealthy family, highest education, already well-known celebrity, possibly a San
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.320]   Hedron member already, a senator in the nation of Israel.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.040]   For any Jew, Pharisee among Pharisees, asked the law, he says perfect.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.360]   For a Jew, he's already on the top.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:04.360]   But he says in comparison, in comparison to the treasure he found in Christ, it became
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.200]   rubbish.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.340]   He didn't make it rubbish, it became rubbish in comparison.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:18.800]   So when our eyes are taken off of Christ, there is nothing else in this world that's
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:27.840]   going to save you from the temptation that we are surrounded by constantly.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:34.300]   You know, I remember when, right before I became a Christian, I was obsessed with baseball.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.600]   Because that was my first love, baseball.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.400]   Before basketball, anything else.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.980]   And my friends decided that we're going to make the Burbank High School baseball team.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.000]   So we spent every single minute that we had, right?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.600]   It probably saved us from a lot of trouble.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.520]   Because we were getting into a lot of trouble prior to that.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.560]   But when we decided to play baseball, every opportunity we had, we went on the baseball
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.600]   field and we had a guy who wanted to play shortstop.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.240]   And so we would just bat to him, right?
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.360]   Hour, two hours, every day.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   And it's my turn.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.920]   So I would take the glove and go to the left field and they would just pop it up, right?
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   Pop up the ball.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:15.200]   And I said, "Put the ball over there so let me see how much distance I can cover.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.840]   So hit it far from me."
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.200]   We did that every day, every opportunity we had, because we were preparing to try to get
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.800]   on this baseball team.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:28.040]   Well, tryouts came out, you know, it started out in December and it was about a week of
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.280]   tryouts and then we took a break.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.000]   And then the second part was going to happen after the break.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.480]   So in between that, I became a Christian.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.440]   It radically changed my life.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.720]   And we spent so much time preparing for it, going to the batting cage and trying to get
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.120]   on this team that we want so much.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:54.200]   But all of a sudden, I meet Christ and I just completely forgot.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.760]   I don't even remember wrestling about this decision because their Bible study was Friday
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.360]   night and all the games were happening Friday night.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   All the practices were happening Friday night.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:09.000]   And so I don't even remember thinking, "Should I?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.640]   I just don't remember that because what would be better than this God that I met?"
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.520]   So I used to live in Burbank and one of the leaders would come and pick me up right after
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.880]   school at 3.30 or 4 o'clock.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.920]   Being in LA, Bible study starts at 7, finishes at 9.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.240]   We go have dinner and then from 11 to 1 or 2 in the morning, we'd have overnight prayer.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.560]   And then sometimes we'd just sleep over at the church just sleeping on the floor, waking
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.520]   up, mowing the lawn of the church because that's the only way they would let us stay
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.600]   there.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.440]   And then waking up, just passing out pamphlets and trying to evangelize.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.360]   And I would come home sometimes like late Saturday.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.200]   And I just remember my parents never asked me where I was.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.320]   I think part of the reason was because I was getting into so much trouble prior to that.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.800]   They knew I was at church so that whatever I was doing over there was going to be much
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.240]   better than me not doing that.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.120]   But I remember that so vividly.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:15.640]   I don't remember struggling to let it go because at that time, my mind was blown.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.520]   God is real?
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.280]   Heaven and hell is real?
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.120]   And that God cares about me?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.760]   And then this is the Bible study that I need to attend to connect with this God versus
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:36.700]   I get to throw this white ball around with these guys?
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.720]   I wasn't a super Christian.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.040]   I wasn't discipled.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   I wasn't more disciplined than the next person.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.120]   I wasn't more noble.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.440]   I wasn't more righteous than anybody else.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   My eyes got open.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:55.440]   I beheld his glory.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.320]   That's why in Revelation when it talks to the church of Ephesus, he says, "Remember
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.960]   the height from which you had fallen.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.440]   Remember when you first beheld God.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.160]   Remember when the gospel first came into you.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.920]   Remember how excited you were about singing, about Bible study, about prayer meetings,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   about evangelism."
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.320]   You notice the difference between somebody who just became a Christian versus somebody
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.560]   who's been a Christian for a while.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.680]   Somebody who's been a Christian for a while and they've become very good at this game
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.480]   like what is required of this church?
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   What is mandatory?
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   So we say, "Hey, we're going to have a meeting."
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   And one of the first questions we think, "Is it mandatory?"
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   Right?
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.000]   Another, "Am I going to be judged?"
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Right?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Yes, you will be judged if you don't come.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   So you better come.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Right?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.560]   So, "Oh, we're going to be judged.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   Okay, then we have to come."
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:50.360]   Versus you meet a new Christian, "Am I allowed to come?
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.400]   Is it okay if I come?
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.320]   Am I allowed to sit here?
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.120]   Can I attend Bible study?"
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:06.840]   The difference between the two is that the young Christian's eyes beheld Christ and he
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:13.320]   realized the privilege that he has to have access to God.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.720]   The privilege that he or she has to worship.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.280]   The privilege to be a part of a community of people to worship God versus somebody who's
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.360]   been a Christian for a while is like, "Do I have to?
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   Is it mandatory?
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.720]   Will I be judged?"
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.520]   Even the way we ask questions, "Is this sin?"
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.400]   These are all questions that are coming from somebody who has been burdened and there's
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:41.080]   no fuel fueling them, just meeting the minimum standards.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.680]   You and I do not have that ability just to suck it up and keep it going if we're not
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.680]   beholding Christ.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.960]   Do you know how you can tell somebody's beholding Christ?
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.200]   They can't contain it.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.640]   They can't contain it.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.640]   Evangelism just doesn't happen.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   It's like, "Tuesday at three o'clock, evangelism."
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.800]   Okay, now I got to evangelize.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.560]   Somebody who's beholding Christ, sit down.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.200]   Sit down and ask them, "What did you do today?"
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.820]   That's enough to get them going.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:17.720]   Somebody who's beholding Christ, fixated on Christ, "Oh, let's have fellowship.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.680]   We're going to have next Wednesday at three o'clock.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.080]   I'm going to say these things.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.040]   I'm going to do these things."
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.780]   Somebody who's beholding Christ, just ask them, "What do you like to do for fun?"
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.240]   Just ask them because it's abundant.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.640]   It's what they're beholding.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:43.160]   Just comes out because just like if you watched a movie that you would just narrate, "Wow,
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.640]   that was great."
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.080]   You don't have to ask them.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.200]   They'll tell you.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   You almost get annoyed.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.480]   "Stop telling me."
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.880]   But because they were so impacted by that, they'll tell you.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:10.060]   That's why he's saying, "Behold, fix your eyes upon Christ that we may have a deepening
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:17.040]   understanding of the breadth, length, height, and depth of the love of Christ."
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:22.720]   The second meaning behind this is not simply to behold but to look intently for help.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.680]   Kind of like the way we use the word when we say, "Who do you look to when you are in
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.660]   trouble?
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.940]   Who do you look to when you have financial problems?
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.580]   Government, the bank, your job, yourself?
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.460]   Who do you look to when you are discouraged?
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:44.900]   Who do you look to when you feel lost or lonely?"
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.300]   We use that word look to look at something for help.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.180]   Your friends, church leaders, government, money.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:57.700]   In Psalm 121, it says, "I will lift up my eyes to the mountains from where shall my
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.860]   help come?
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:04.140]   My help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth."
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:10.740]   In other words, the person that I'm beholding, this person that I'm looking to for help,
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   he created the universe.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:19.840]   That's why the Bible always, when the Bible introduces us to God, you notice how often
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.180]   the Bible says, "God the creator."
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.380]   Repeatedly, "God who created the universe.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.020]   That God who created your inner being."
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.260]   Why is he saying that?
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.460]   Meaning that his power cannot be exhausted.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.460]   He's all powerful.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.340]   The God that you are looking to doesn't have a limit in their bank account, doesn't have
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.900]   limited resources.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.660]   He's God the creator.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.280]   He's the one that I run to.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.800]   He will not allow your foot to slip.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.860]   He who keeps you will not slumber.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:39:00.620]   Probably most of us, the closest thing that you and I can relate to, to agape love, is
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.860]   the love that you and I receive from our mothers.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:11.020]   Even if they're not the best, they're sinners too, but probably the closest to somebody
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:16.820]   who is willing to sacrifice their well-being in order that you and I could eat and live
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:22.660]   and sleep comfortably, most of us will probably say it's our mothers.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:27.660]   Deservedly so, because they sacrifice.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.080]   It's hard being a mother.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:36.740]   I mean, you can't be selfish when you have kids around, because if a mother is selfish,
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.740]   children die.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.780]   And that's not an exaggeration.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.520]   If a mother is selfish, children don't eat.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.380]   If the mother is selfish, they're not protected.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.800]   They're going to run around naked, starve to death.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.400]   That's what's going to happen if the mother is selfish.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:59.840]   So the closest thing that you and I can experience, oh, that's kind of like that.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.840]   But even the mothers grow weary.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.040]   Even the best of mothers get tired.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:14.540]   Even the best of mothers are human and sinners themselves.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:20.700]   So he says, "But the God that we look to, he keeps Israel and will neither slumber nor
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.700]   sleep.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.700]   The Lord is your keeper.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.560]   The Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.100]   The sun will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.220]   The Lord will protect you from all evil.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.220]   He will keep your soul.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:41.380]   The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in from the time forth and forever."
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.880]   The Lord will.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.100]   Anything else that we are beholding for our strength, anything else that we are turning
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.820]   to eventually will let you down.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:56.320]   My guess is you've probably experienced that already.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:00.220]   Whether it's an institution, whether it's your circumstance, whether it was the government
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:07.580]   or maybe it was a leader, whatever it is that you turn to that replaces where only God can
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:15.580]   be eventually will let you down because nothing lives up to that scrutiny.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.960]   Nothing.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.580]   Not your husband, not your wife, not your children, not your circumstance, not your
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.220]   leader, not your pastor, not your elders.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.220]   Nothing lives up to that scrutiny but God himself.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:32.900]   That's why in order to run this race with perseverance, we need to fix our eyes on Jesus
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.700]   who started the race and he's going to be the one who finishes the race and only those
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:45.380]   who are gazing, beholding, and growing in beholding will persevere in their race.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:53.880]   I remember a pastor years ago described Christians beholding Christ in eternity like an ant trying
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.740]   to describe an elephant.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.660]   And the ant would get on the trunk and say, "Oh, the elephant is like this.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.100]   It's long and slinky."
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.460]   And then he would take a few steps and end up on the trunk.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.100]   He's like, "Oh, I was wrong.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.740]   It's actually white and very tough."
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.340]   And then he would walk over to the ice.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:16.140]   "Actually, it's very liquidy."
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:20.340]   And so every few steps he takes, he recognizes a different part of the elephant.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.700]   He's like, "Well, what is he?
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.700]   Who is he?"
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.400]   Well, that's a tiny little ant that's trying to describe something gigantic.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:34.140]   And so none of it is wrong, but not one thing is ever comprehensive.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:42.020]   And he described how us beholding Christ is going to be like that, but far greater.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.520]   But for all eternity, we're going to be gawking at him.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:51.260]   And every time we turn around, we see a different aspect, that God's love is much deeper than
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.300]   I thought.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.140]   It's much wider than I thought, much higher than I thought.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.160]   God was much holier than I possibly imagined.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.980]   God is more worthy than I could have possibly told.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:15.160]   And for all eternity, he is completely eternal, always immutable, is going to inspire worship.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.660]   And it is that God that he is referring to, that in order to run this race, to finish
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:26.560]   this race, to fix our eyes upon Jesus, the author, the beginner, and the one who will
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.440]   finish the race, the fuel to be able to persevere.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.180]   Let me finish with this in Isaiah 40, 28 to 31.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.080]   Do you not know, have you not heard, the everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.780]   the earth, does not become weary or tired.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.600]   His understanding is inscrutable.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.280]   He gives strength to the weary.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.800]   To him who lacks might, he increases power.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.160]   Though youths grow weary and tired and vigorous, young men stumble badly.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.860]   Yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.360]   They will mount up with wings like eagles.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.480]   They will run and not get tired.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.360]   They will walk and not become weary.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:15.600]   For parents, especially for moms on Mother's Day, thank you for your sacrifice.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.040]   And I know, especially, whether you are a veteran mom or you're a brand new mom, the
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:28.760]   sacrifices that you make and to present what agape love looks like to the family and to
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.400]   the children.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:36.960]   But along with that, I want to make this very clear.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.600]   Your love is not enough.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:48.640]   No matter how much you pour into your children, your love is not sufficient enough.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:58.300]   Your love, no matter how much you sacrifice, will not be enough to save your child.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:06.760]   The only love that can change a lost soul, that his identity is changed as a child of
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:14.200]   God for eternity, is when they also behold this love for themselves.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:22.200]   So the best that you and I could do, the best that a mother can do, is help them see that.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:31.200]   The best way for you to do that is for yourself to behold that, to be a witness of that.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.560]   Our love is not enough.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:40.920]   My shepherding in this church is not enough.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:48.840]   My preaching, organization skills, sacrifice is not enough.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:58.040]   That's why the primary goal every Sunday is to help you see that Christ is worthy.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.720]   That He is worthy of our attention.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.900]   He is worthy of our sacrifice.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.760]   That He is worthy to follow.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.880]   He's worthy to let go of this world.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:16.240]   Because only when you behold the same Christ would you also pick up your cross and follow
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.880]   Him.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.440]   Behold Him.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:26.120]   You and I are not gifted enough, we're not strong enough, we're not disciplined enough,
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:31.400]   but by the grace of God, He has called us to be His witness.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.960]   To be His witness.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.680]   So let's witness this glory.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.680]   Let's witness this love.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.640]   And tell the world what they do not see.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.120]   So that they also may come and know this Christ for themselves.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.840]   Let's pray.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:57.880]   Again, as our worship team comes up, if I can ask you to take some time to let the Word
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.160]   of God dwell in your hearts.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.760]   If you've grown up in the church and you just say, "Yeah, I know Jesus died for me.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.200]   I believe that, so I'm going to go to heaven."
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   And that's your level of Christianity.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.160]   You don't understand what you're worshiping.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.040]   You don't understand what you're seeing.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.840]   You don't understand the Word of God that's being opened.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.360]   To humble yourself before the Lord and ask, "Do I really know this God?
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.800]   Have I actually gazed upon His glory?"
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.120]   It takes some time to come before the Lord in honest confession.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.240]   "Lord, I don't think I know You.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:37.920]   Open my eyes, Lord, that I may behold Your glory as well."
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:42.840]   If you happen to be somebody who grew up in the church and you're so busy doing so many
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:50.160]   things but only one thing is required of you, fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   Fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.360]   Do you love this Jesus?
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.600]   You're laboring for Jesus.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.960]   You're sacrificing for Jesus.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.560]   You are working for Jesus.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.920]   But do you love this Jesus?
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:08.440]   We also need to take a step back and fix our eyes upon what it is that we worship,
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.480]   what it is that we have.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:17.320]   Let's take some time to pray the same prayer that Paul prays, that with all knowledge,
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:22.480]   that we would have the strength with all the saints to comprehend the width, the length,
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.720]   the height, and the depth of the love of Christ.
