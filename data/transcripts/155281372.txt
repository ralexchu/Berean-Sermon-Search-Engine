[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.960]   --in India.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.760]   The area that we went to India is not typically a place that--
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.760]   if somebody says they went to India for missions,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.400]   this is not the typical place that they go to.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.400]   Usually, they'll go to Delhi or Mumbai or maybe even Bangalore,
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.080]   but this is about five hours into the countryside.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.000]   So the nearest airport of any kind, local or international,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.920]   is about five hours' drive away.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.800]   So I shared this with you last year
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.120]   when we were going in there.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.440]   I didn't know a single Westerner or any foreigner
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.520]   that's been in that area.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.960]   And so when I told this to my Southern Baptist friends,
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.680]   they were actually a little bit concerned.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.440]   They'd been praying for us last year,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.940]   and they prayed for us this year throughout the whole trip.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.280]   So I was texting with my wife and a local pastor
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.960]   here because they were having prayer meetings for us
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.240]   throughout their meetings, and he wanted an update
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.360]   on what's going on.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.040]   So going in this year, I thought I'd
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.880]   be a little bit less anxious because we have experience
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.520]   from last year.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.040]   But to my surprise, I think all the things
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.320]   that I've been reading in the last year, the persecution
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.840]   going on, is concentrated up in North where we were not,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.600]   but also in the Southern area.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.880]   And in the Southern area, in that little strip
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.080]   where the heaviest concentration of unreached people groups
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200]   are in that local area.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.680]   And those pastors are actively pursuing
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.200]   to share the gospel.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.280]   And so the reason why we made contact
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.480]   is because I met this pastor in one of the earlier trips
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.800]   that I went with other pastors to do pastoral training.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.680]   And as I got to spend time with him,
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.060]   his English was good enough where
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.880]   he was sharing with me about his father's testimony.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480]   And again, the more I heard his father's testimony,
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.160]   it intrigued me.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.520]   It's like, wow, there's people actually doing this.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.760]   And I share this again.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.480]   I'm not going to go too much into detail,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.080]   but his father became a Christian,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   used to be a Hindu priest, and converted.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.760]   And basically, he was shunned by his family,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.280]   took his young children.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.440]   At the time, he had two kids, a three-year-old
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.560]   and a one-year-old.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440]   Then eventually, he had two more kids.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.980]   And basically, for the last 40 years,
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.840]   he's been traveling from village to village
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.160]   sharing the gospel.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.480]   Last year, when I talked to him, he
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.360]   told me that there was a period when he was so depressed
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.520]   because he couldn't take care of his kids.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.920]   And there were times when they would walk into villages,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.880]   and people were hostile.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.720]   They don't have time to walk back out.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.220]   So a lot of times, they would just
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.560]   be sleeping out in the fields.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.920]   And again, I heard this from the kids.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.800]   They said they remember this when they were little kids, just
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   walking into villages.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.600]   And a lot of times, he didn't have enough food
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.040]   to feed their children.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.440]   And he said there was a period when he was so depressed
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.320]   about it that he was thinking about taking his life.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.480]   And he thought that maybe if he wasn't around,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.200]   that his family would have an easier life.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.080]   But because God so burdened him for the gospel,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.480]   that he saw his family suffering.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.880]   And so for the last 40 years, in the midst of all of this,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.600]   he's been walking from village to village.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.000]   And every testimony that we heard,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.960]   eventually, it was linked to this pastor, this one pastor.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.560]   He's in his mid-60s.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.120]   And he said, oh, they came in and shared the gospel.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.760]   And initially, I thought, what's this crazy guy doing?
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.400]   And then he was persistent.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.520]   And so each one of them came to Christ.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.440]   And now they have a network of 32 pastors.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.760]   And they oversee about three churches.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.360]   And they told me they have about 80 to 85 churches
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.720]   that they've planted.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.920]   And I asked them, what is the size
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.400]   and how many members they have?
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.320]   And they have over about 2,000 people and growing.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.760]   That if you put them all together--
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.360]   so each one of these churches have anywhere from 30
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.600]   to Pastor Matthew's church.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   That was the original one.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.560]   It held over a couple hundred people in that one.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.000]   And again, they're doing ministry.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.200]   And they're in the midst of much persecution.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.240]   When we first decided to go in, it was simply an opportunity.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.480]   I was curious.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.520]   And I knew the area that we were going into
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.120]   was maybe not safe, because they don't have
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.880]   a lot of foreigners in that area.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.240]   But I felt like God opened the door,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.120]   kind of like how we first got into China.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.360]   God opened the door.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.120]   And I thought, well, if God opened the door,
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.200]   let's go in and see what God's going to do.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.160]   And that's kind of how we started out in India,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.640]   wanting to go and check out the ministry.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.540]   And that was last year.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.200]   So last year, we kind of broke ground.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.160]   I was a little bit nervous, because we didn't
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.360]   know where we were going.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.440]   And I think every single one of us who went last year,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.960]   that initial road to get to this place kind of, I think,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.840]   surprised all of us.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.380]   We knew we were going to the boonies,
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.120]   but this was literally the remotest part of the world.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.200]   And we got there.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   We broke ground, spent some time with the pastor.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.600]   We were all very encouraged.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.280]   This year, for me, was a little bit different,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.920]   because already, again, the ground was broken.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.600]   Nothing that we did this year was new or surprising to me.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.820]   And I know a few of the other people that went last year
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.640]   could say the same thing.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.080]   The biggest difference for me this year versus last year
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.640]   was I felt like I made a lasting connection with these pastors.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.580]   A lot of the same familiar faces,
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.400]   and being able to hear the testimonies,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.920]   and spending time with them, that they're not just projects.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.840]   They're not just people out in China.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.960]   But they've really become friends.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.440]   And so now the ministry in China is not simply
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   that doors open, so we're going in.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.400]   But it's become a lot more personal.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.280]   So when I think about persecution in India,
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.400]   I'm not thinking about some random faces.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.760]   I'm thinking specifically about these pastors.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.120]   Pastor Saki, the guy that I had initial contact with,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.800]   last year he kept us away from his little village,
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.440]   because-- well, it's not little.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.480]   There's a lot of people there.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.680]   Because last year, while we were there,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.640]   the militant Hindus actually were
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.120]   getting organized to weed out Christians in his area.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.800]   So when I asked him about his place, and he said,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.000]   he deliberately tried to keep us away from there,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.040]   because it wasn't safe at that time.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.760]   So this year, when we got there, I
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.840]   asked him what's the first village we're going to.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.680]   And he said he was going to take us to his hometown.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.120]   And the first thing I thought was,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.680]   I thought you didn't want us to go there last year.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.840]   And he said, last year, specifically because they
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.920]   were having that meeting.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.680]   And it's still not safe, but they just
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.400]   weren't having that meeting this year.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.100]   And so we were able to go to his village.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.920]   We were able to go and visit his home.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.600]   And he told us that in that particular area where he lives,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.360]   the hostility toward Christians is concentrated.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.440]   And he told us that that area, they
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.320]   can't walk around with Bibles in their hands,
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.240]   because once they're identified as Christians,
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.400]   they get targeted.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.040]   So they have to kind of stay low.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.720]   And then what really was heartbreaking
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.760]   was he told us about what it's like for their children.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.480]   And he said that he has one daughter.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.880]   And he said that when he goes to school,
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.000]   sometimes to win over their friends because
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.520]   of the hostility, he said he gave candy or chocolate
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.080]   to pass out to their friends.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.160]   And some of the friends told him that their parents said,
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.320]   don't even receive chocolate from these Christians.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.080]   We don't want anything to do with them.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.680]   And so they have Hindu friends, but they
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.320]   would try to go over to their friend's house.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.660]   And the parents won't allow them to come into the house.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.840]   So he has to stay outside while their Hindu friends go in
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.080]   and out of their homes.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.760]   And saying that is very, very difficult.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.380]   And he told me that his wife understands
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.360]   because she's an adult. But he said the hardest part of it
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.040]   is his daughter.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.040]   He's away from home a lot because he's
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.160]   going to village to village.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.040]   And those of you who've been there before,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.040]   you know that going to village is not like here,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.400]   where you just hop in a car, go, and then come back.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.880]   Making a commitment to go there is either all day
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.680]   or sometimes several day commitment to go and come back.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.340]   And so oftentimes, he's not there.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.100]   And financially, there's no support.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.500]   So his wife has to work at night to get some support.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.740]   And they're barely surviving with that.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.720]   But in the midst of all of this, they're spreading the gospel.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   People are coming to Christ.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.620]   They're having a hard time feeding their kids.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.780]   But they're committed to the gospel cause.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.480]   Pastor Matthew has full-blown diabetes,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.720]   but he doesn't have enough money for medication.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.780]   So obviously, we gave him some so that he can buy medication.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.520]   But despite all of that, he's still
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.680]   going from village to village, even now, sharing the gospel.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.320]   Oftentimes, people talk about how you had a heart for India,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.720]   or you had a heart for China.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.240]   And all of that is great.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.720]   And it's great that God gives us heart for certain things.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.400]   But the Great Commission is not a theology to be studied.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.320]   It is a commandment to be obeyed.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.280]   We don't wait for God to stir our hearts to obey.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.400]   Obedience is something we do, whether we
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.120]   feel like it or not.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.640]   A lot of times, our heart doesn't
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.720]   follow because we're not obeying.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.680]   God will give you the heart when you obey, not before you obey.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.760]   And there are times when God will stir you up
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.400]   to give you the energy to go before you go.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.440]   But oftentimes, the heart and compassion--
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.960]   people say that all the time.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.680]   How do we pray for people that we don't know?
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.280]   How do we have compassion for people we don't know?
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.480]   Well, get to know them.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.320]   Get to know them.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.520]   And God will give you a heart.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.080]   The Great Commission is vital in our personal relationship
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.000]   with God.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.360]   It's not like God saved you.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.920]   Now you have a personal relationship.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.080]   And here is all these other things that I should be doing.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.600]   And if I don't, it doesn't really matter that much.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.040]   We don't realize in the West how intimately
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.320]   the Great Commission is directly linked
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.400]   to your personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.320]   The Great Commission is linked to following Jesus.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.960]   Typically, when we say--
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.040]   we all say we're followers of Jesus Christ,
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.120]   followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.280]   If I asked you to follow me, just follow me,
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.440]   what's the first thing that you're going to ask me?
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.480]   Where are you going?
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.640]   That's what you're going to ask, right?
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.960]   Unless you're like, OK, where do I go?
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.040]   The first thing you're going to ask is, where are you going?
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.880]   When Jesus called his disciples to follow him,
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.320]   he specifically said, I will make you fishers of men.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.920]   The scripture says in Luke 19.10,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.240]   "For the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost."
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.360]   That's where he's going.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.920]   He's going to the lost to save them.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.720]   1 Timothy 1.15, it says, "It is a trustworthy statement
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.080]   deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.720]   to save sinners, among whom I am the foremost."
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   That this is who Jesus is.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.440]   This is what he came to do.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.160]   And this is why he called the disciples.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.120]   This is not new in the New Testament.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.660]   We see it all over the Old Testament.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.800]   Ezekiel 34.16, "The Lord says to the nation of Israel,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.880]   I will seek the lost.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.640]   I will bring back the strayed.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.400]   I will bind up the injured.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.600]   And I will strengthen the weak."
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.060]   See, for a Christian, the Great Commission is not an option.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.280]   If we follow Jesus, meaning if we are genuinely
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.240]   following Jesus, we have to be going where he is going.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.160]   We have to be doing what he is doing.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.560]   We cannot say with any kind of consistency
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.280]   that we are followers of Jesus
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.000]   if we're not following where he is going.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   That's why Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9.16,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.160]   "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel."
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.660]   Woe to me.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.320]   Because preaching the gospel is directly linked
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.240]   to his relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.880]   You know the Great Commission, the last commandment,
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.120]   the Great Commission that Jesus gave to his disciples.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.800]   He says, "All authority in heaven and earth
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.640]   has been given to me.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.880]   Therefore, go make disciples."
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.660]   And he concludes the Great Commission by saying,
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.960]   "Lo, I am with you to the end of the age."
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.680]   His promise to be with us is linked to the Great Commission.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.840]   He didn't simply say, "I'm gonna be with you
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.320]   because raising children is difficult.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.420]   I'm gonna be with you because it's lonely
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.140]   living in this fallen world."
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.260]   He said, "I'm gonna be with you,"
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.980]   one, in the context of sharing the gospel,
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.460]   taking the gospel to the remotest part of the world,
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.140]   to the light into darkness.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.940]   He said, "Do not fear when persecution come
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.540]   because I will be with you."
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.500]   He was not in the context of comforting
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.380]   the natural difficulties of living
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.780]   in a sinful and fallen world.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.240]   Not that our God doesn't care about that.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.160]   Not that God doesn't give us comfort for those things.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.120]   But his primary promise of his presence in our lives,
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.840]   to be courageous because I will be with you.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.640]   For a Christian who is disengaged with the Great Commission
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.020]   cannot understand the comfort of his presence in our lives.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.800]   In, Paul says, in Romans 1, 14 to 15,
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.200]   "I am under obligation both to the Greeks
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.440]   and to the barbarians, and both to the wise
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.160]   and to the foolish."
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.880]   We have a tendency, again, in our generation,
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.180]   you know, whenever something becomes difficult,
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.720]   we have a tendency to change our theology.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.200]   That when the challenge of living a Christian life
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.960]   becomes too difficult, the easiest thing to do
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.520]   is to change our theology to accommodate
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.800]   whatever life that we choose.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.280]   Following Christ is too difficult.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.840]   The cross is too hard.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.960]   The commandments are too burdensome.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.480]   So we shift our theology and make it easier.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.400]   But see, Apostle Paul talked about preaching the gospel
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.520]   as an obligation.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.880]   And we have a tendency to think that any talk
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.760]   of obligation is legalism.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.200]   And we have to take that obligation.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.240]   No, we have to be compelled.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.680]   Paul here says, "I am obligated by the gospel
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.280]   of Jesus Christ to preach to Greeks and barbarians."
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.000]   But immediately, when we think of obligation,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.200]   we think of drudgery.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   We think of doing something we don't want to do.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.920]   But Paul says in verse 15, "So because of this obligation,
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.840]   I am eager to preach the gospel to you also
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.760]   who are in Rome."
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.280]   Some of the greatest joys in our life
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.000]   comes along with it, the greatest obligation.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.080]   Every parent in this room, the greatest burden
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.400]   in your life are your children.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.800]   Because they take the most time.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.760]   They require the most money.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.000]   They take whatever leisure time you have
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.880]   and they suck the life out of you, right?
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.200]   The greatest obligation in your life is your children.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   There's nothing more important, not your work,
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.680]   not even your own health, than your own kids.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.200]   You are obligated to your children.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.800]   But ask any parent in the room, what is the greatest joy?
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.920]   It's also their children.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.520]   The greatest satisfaction, the greatest joy
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.000]   comes also from their kids.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.920]   See, obligation and joy are not two exclusive things.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.000]   The scripture says in Psalm 34, seven,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.360]   "Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.440]   the desires of your heart."
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.520]   That when Christ becomes our delight,
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.400]   our satisfaction, our joy also comes with him.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.600]   The greatest desire and the greatest joy
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.360]   comes with the greatest obligation.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.920]   There is no obligation greater
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.840]   than preaching the gospel to the lost.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.760]   There's no greater obligation.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.680]   And that is not something that you have
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.520]   to even read the scripture to say.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.160]   I don't have to exposit a text,
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.440]   and I don't have to go through
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.480]   the meta-narrative of scripture.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.360]   All we have to do is have common sense.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.640]   If you have the only cure for a lost world
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.200]   in their dark sin, if you know that if they die,
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.160]   that there's judgment waiting for them,
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160]   and you know the only answer is Jesus Christ,
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.880]   you don't need exposition of scripture
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.000]   to tell you that that is our obligation.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.040]   It is our obligation to have the gospel.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.920]   It is the obligation of every Christian
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.160]   that knows and confesses this truth.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.680]   And yet the scripture clearly says
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.800]   that this is the greatest and the most wonderful commandment.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.340]   Ask anybody who's ever experienced
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.560]   and truly given their life for this cause
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.940]   where the source of greatest joy is.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.560]   It's in seeing people come to Christ
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.380]   that we were able to spend even just a week purposefully.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.160]   Because let's be honest,
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.540]   how many weeks can you think of in 2015
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.000]   that you were absolutely spent doing God's work?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.280]   I mean, maybe bits and pieces here.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.720]   So every single one of us on this trip,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.740]   and again, I know many of you have experienced
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.760]   the same thing in different trips,
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.240]   that's a whole week's worth of our time, energy, and money
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.380]   was spent in a strange place, people we've never met,
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.240]   maybe possibly risking some persecution,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   but at the end of the day, fully satisfied, fully joyful,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.860]   because God was able to use us
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.360]   in a small way to preach the gospel.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.360]   See, our greatest joy also comes from our greatest obligation
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.440]   and if you continue to neglect your obligation,
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.760]   you also continue to push away the greatest source of joy
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.520]   that God has placed in your life.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.240]   Our personal relationship with the Holy Spirit
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.280]   is directly linked to the Great Commission.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.920]   Every once in a while, somebody will come in and say,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.740]   "Oh, you know, this church is all about the Bible,
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.000]   "but it's not about the Holy Spirit."
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.520]   And when they say that, what they're saying is
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.320]   they want more emotion, they wanna see some people
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.800]   dancing on the aisle, they want people raising hands
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.560]   and crying during worship, and I have nothing against that.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.160]   If you wanna dance, dance quietly in the back,
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.400]   you know, like, I have nothing against that, right?
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.960]   Don't distract us, right?
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.360]   You wanna raise your hand, you wanna weep,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.400]   you know, while you're praising God, awesome!
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.660]   We should be emotional in our worship toward God.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.080]   But the primary role of the Holy Spirit
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.000]   is linked to the Great Commission.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.720]   In Acts chapter one, six through eight,
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.840]   and you know that passage in verse eight when he says,
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.400]   "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.200]   "comes upon you, you will be my witnesses."
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.680]   You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   to the remotest part of the world.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.480]   But prior to him making that commandment,
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.520]   the disciples were stuck on,
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.440]   are you now going to restore the kingdom to Israel?
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.620]   That was the question, because that's what they were
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.640]   focused on before he went to the cross, remember?
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.560]   He said, "When the kingdom comes, can you let us sit
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.480]   "on the left or to the right?
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.440]   "Who's gonna be the greatest when the kingdom comes?"
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.040]   And that's what they were focused on,
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.200]   because all of the prophets,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.720]   even in the midst of all the judgment,
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.320]   always ends and always reminds us
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.800]   that even though judgment is coming,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.760]   God will restore one day the kingdom.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.920]   So this is what they were fixated on.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.840]   And then even after Jesus was resurrected,
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.960]   that's what they were fixated, is it now?
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.800]   We thought it was gonna happen before the cross,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.960]   and we didn't understand where the cross fit into this,
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.280]   but now we see that even in death, they cannot contain you.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.080]   So now, is it now are you gonna restore the kingdom?
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.480]   And Jesus says to them, "It is not for you to know
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.600]   "times or the seasons that the Father has fixed
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.880]   "by his own authority."
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.160]   Whenever we look at this text,
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.720]   we always kinda get caught up in,
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.680]   it's like, oh, the end times,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.240]   we're not gonna know about the end times.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.660]   Let's not calculate the end times.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.800]   There's a much more practical application
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.680]   to what Jesus is saying here,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.080]   than you're not gonna know the specific time or the hour.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.160]   The practical thing that Jesus is saying is,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.000]   you're focused on making this kingdom your home.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.080]   You're focused, because that's what we're all focused on.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.720]   Your focus is, is it now you're gonna restore the kingdom?
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.120]   We've been waiting for this for hundreds and hundreds
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.040]   of years, is it now are you going to bring this kingdom
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.160]   that we've been waiting for?
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.840]   And Jesus basically is saying,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.880]   it's not for you to think about that now.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   Now is the time for the great commission.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.920]   That time will come one day,
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.360]   when Christ comes and he restores his kingdom,
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.040]   and he glorifies us, and redeems his church finally
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.680]   in glorification, but now is not the time
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.640]   for you to be thinking about that.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.240]   Now is the time for the great commission.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.020]   And you will be my witnesses when the Holy Spirit comes.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.560]   See, the whole purpose of the Holy Spirit
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.120]   is not simply comfort us because life is difficult.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.400]   Although he does do that.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.160]   The whole point of the Holy Spirit is not so that
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.160]   we can become emotional when we sing.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.200]   Although that is a big benefit of the movement
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.920]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.060]   The primary purpose of the Holy Spirit is to empower us
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.320]   for the great commission.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.840]   John 15, 26, but when the helper, the Holy Spirit comes,
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.400]   whom I will send to you from the Father,
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.560]   Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.660]   he will bear witness about me.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.920]   Because the disciples were afraid.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.800]   Their situation was much worse than even the pastors
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.880]   who were preaching the gospel in the villages.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.800]   Persecution was real.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.040]   Taking the gospel to the areas where hostility,
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.200]   where people are gonna be stoned, and literally going to die,
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.320]   he says, don't worry, the Holy Spirit is going to be
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.560]   with you, and he will bear witness about me.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.120]   I am not sending you on your own.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.960]   Again, in John 16, eight, he says, when he comes,
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.040]   the Holy Spirit, he will convict the world concerning sin,
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.800]   righteousness, and judgment.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.000]   So when we talk about engaging the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.920]   we're not simply talking about emotionalism,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.160]   we're not simply talking about some mystical inner working
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.760]   of emotions and power, we're talking about the power
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.080]   to preach the gospel with effectiveness
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   is directly linked to the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:54.480]   So if we're not engaged in the work of the gospel ministry,
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.080]   in proclaiming the gospel, the Great Commission,
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.520]   you cannot be engaged in the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.160]   It doesn't matter how emotional you get in the service.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.200]   It doesn't matter how passionate you feel inwardly,
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.520]   because the primary purpose of the Holy Spirit
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.980]   is to move you forward with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.640]   Not only is it linked to, directly linked to our relationship
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.120]   with Jesus, directly linked to the work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.200]   proclaiming of the gospel, the Great Commission,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.560]   is directly linked to our fellowship.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.160]   Every time Christians get together, it isn't fellowship,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.840]   especially in our generation, right?
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.160]   Fellowship, again, has become just a place
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.800]   where Christians by name have come together
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.940]   and we talk about whatever we talk about,
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.880]   do whatever we do, as long as we're Christians,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.840]   we have fellowship.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.720]   That's not what the word means.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.160]   The typical word that's translated, kononia,
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.160]   literal translation means to partner together.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.560]   So again, if I say let's partner together, right,
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.960]   what are you gonna ask me?
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   For what?
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.720]   If fellowship means partnering,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.400]   what are we partnering together for?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.720]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.720]   Paul uses that term in the book of Philippians
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.720]   as partnering financially.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.400]   He calls his fellow workers of the gospel
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.840]   partners in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.040]   Partnering and fellowship go hand in hand.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.800]   So much frustration in the church happens
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.120]   because people are staggering from church to church,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.400]   looking for like-minded, right?
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.480]   When we say like-minded,
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.300]   we're talking about similar personalities,
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.480]   similar interest in movies, similar interest in travel,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.960]   your background, language, age, culture,
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.600]   but it's so superficial in the church.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.560]   I know yesterday they had football.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.600]   You know, the men had football,
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.960]   and I think the women's football tournament
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.920]   is coming up pretty soon,
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.400]   and you know, there's some,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.380]   I don't know how the oldest member of the football team is,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.440]   but from what I hear, probably late 30s, right?
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.240]   I don't think anybody 40 and over
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.640]   in the right mind would have done that.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.640]   But late 30s, and I know as young as 18, right?
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.480]   As young as 18 to 38-year-old.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.200]   Got together and played football for this competition.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.920]   I didn't hear one time the older guy say,
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.920]   "I couldn't connect with these guys."
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.760]   You know?
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.680]   "I couldn't connect with them
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.720]   "because there's nobody my age here.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.300]   "I want to be in the defensive line with guys my age."
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.260]   I didn't hear any 18-year-old saying,
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.500]   "I can't play with these old guys.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.980]   "What do I have in common with these guys?
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.120]   "They don't understand me."
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.000]   You know, they're too advanced in their stage in life.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.320]   Nobody says that because the goal of this game is to win.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.680]   And so whoever you are partnering with for this game
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.440]   are your brothers and are your sisters.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.320]   Because what brings them together is not age,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.880]   it's not language, it's not culture.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.480]   It's this goal.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.280]   You're partnering together.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.000]   See, true fellowship in the church
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.600]   has nothing to do with your background as a human being.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.360]   In fact, the beauty of the church is
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.680]   people who would never spend time together
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.440]   outside if it wasn't for Christ.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.040]   Why would somebody in their 60s
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.400]   hang out with somebody in their teens?
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.200]   Why would somebody from this culture
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.920]   hang out with this person in that culture?
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.040]   Why would somebody from that economic status
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.400]   spend all their time with people in this economic status?
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.040]   Early church was filled with slave owners,
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.980]   with former slaves, Pharisees, and tax collectors.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.720]   The young and the old.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.700]   Sometimes they didn't even speak the same language,
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.520]   they were in the same church.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.280]   But that was the beauty of the early church.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.360]   What brought them together was the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.960]   and the proclamation of this same gospel.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.680]   Fellowship happens in the context of partnering together
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.200]   for the Great Commission, it happens.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.060]   You know that short time that we were there out in India,
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.080]   you know, just the ride alone,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.160]   like to me the hardest part of any mission trip
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.360]   is the plane ride there and plane ride back.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.440]   You know, the five hours in the bus
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.240]   isn't as bad because it's five hours.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.960]   Well this is 16 hours of one flight
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.360]   and then resting and another three and a half hours going.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.600]   And every year I get older it gets harder and harder.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.560]   You know, and even the younger members of our team,
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.380]   I mean going out, we didn't go to a comfortable place.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.200]   Our hotel was nice, right,
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.080]   comparably to everything else out there.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.060]   The food was decent, right.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.920]   For some people, I'm not really into Indian food, right.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.720]   I've had enough Indian food for the rest of the year.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.800]   I'll save that for next year, right.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.200]   But fellowship happens in that context.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.600]   Even while we're goofing around,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.960]   even while we're having fun, at the end of the day,
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.800]   because all our mind and attention,
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.640]   our energy is spent toward the same thing.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.740]   And at the end of the day, we don't have to force,
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.160]   like hey, let's talk about Jesus today.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.800]   Because we were laboring for the same thing.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.080]   We're all tired at the end of the day doing the same thing.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.400]   And if there's any frustration,
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.280]   it's frustration in the same thing.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.320]   And so when we get together, fellowship happens.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.600]   But when you have a group of people
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.360]   who are not laboring toward the same thing
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.420]   and trying very hard to connect,
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.840]   you have to be, I want somebody my age,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.200]   from my background, with that many kids,
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.600]   and you know, with this kind of struggle,
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.760]   with this kind of, oh, I can relate to that person
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.640]   because we're in the exact same place in life, right?
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.280]   And until we find that person or that group,
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.040]   we don't experience fellowship.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.620]   That's not fellowship.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.000]   You're looking for friends.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.060]   And that's no different than the rest of the world,
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.640]   staggering from place to place,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.920]   looking for a friendship that I can connect with,
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.800]   somebody exactly like me, looks like me, smells like me.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.640]   Right?
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.360]   Maybe not smells like me, but you know.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.540]   Somebody exactly like me.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.280]   And then we get frustrated when it doesn't happen.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.080]   Fellowship that is promised in scripture
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.800]   has nothing to do with how old you are,
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.460]   your language, your culture, your background,
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.520]   stage in life has nothing to do with that.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.720]   Fellowship in the church is when people
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   who are committed to the cause of Christ
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.400]   simply are laboring together.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   I find encouragement, you know,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.400]   most of the team are a lot younger than I am,
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.880]   but just being with them, you know,
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.200]   'cause they're sacrificing.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.200]   And I was encouraged by every single one of them, you know.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.680]   I was the, what do you call it?
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.560]   Slaggard, sluggard in this group?
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.680]   I usually am because they all have particular work to do
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.160]   and I don't have a specific assignment.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   All my work happens before I go.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.280]   And then when I go there, my work is to make sure
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.320]   that they're doing their work, you know.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.280]   But I'm encouraged by every single one of them.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.560]   Our VBS team, you know, they were out in the sun
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.280]   for three hours, four hours at a time,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.360]   didn't take a break at all.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.840]   Then there's certain things happens
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.240]   that we can't share with you.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.280]   Certain videos that we, what's it?
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.860]   So some people, no, okay.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:19.920]   I can't go any further than that
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.640]   because what happens in India stays in India.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.660]   But fellowship happens in the context
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.240]   of partnering together for the gospel.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.640]   You take that great commission out
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.960]   and you try to artificially create this, like,
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.520]   connection with one another.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.840]   That's no different than anything in the world, right?
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.040]   Any little comment, any little difference,
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.600]   any little insensitive thing that's said,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.280]   all of it, that's enough to break off, break that off.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.120]   Right?
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.080]   It's so, any friendship outside of Christ is so fragile.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.320]   But it's in the context of partnering together
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.420]   and that's why the gospel and the church fellowship,
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.200]   it's directly linked.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.760]   And let me tell you right now,
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:06.200]   if you feel disconnected because,
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.280]   for whatever the reason,
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.840]   and you're not partnering in the gospel,
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.360]   it could be other reasons, but maybe the primary reason
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.720]   is because you're not partnering together
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.060]   in the gospel ministry.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.580]   The great commission affects our prayer life.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.640]   The call to pray is directly linked to the great commission.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.900]   Colossians 4, two to four, it says,
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.500]   "Continue steadfastly in prayer,
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.440]   "being watchful in it with thanksgiving.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.200]   "At the same time, pray also for us
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.480]   "that God may open the door for the word,
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.760]   "to declare the mystery of Christ
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.100]   "on account of which I am in prison,
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.460]   "that I may make it clear which is how I ought to speak."
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.320]   Think about the content of our prayer.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.140]   And if it is any different than a Buddhist prayer,
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:53.160]   or if it is any different than somebody who worships idols,
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.740]   because if you listen carefully to their prayers,
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.960]   they pray for safety, just like we do.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.460]   They pray that their God would help their crops to grow,
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.960]   so that they can have a nice life.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.620]   When they get sick, they take offerings
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.400]   to whatever idol that they worship,
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.040]   and they drop some stuff in there,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.500]   hoping that that will cure the problem.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.600]   See, what makes a Christian prayer
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   different than a prayer of the Buddhists and the Hindus
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.560]   is the content of our prayer.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.460]   Our prayer is not to bring this kingdom.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.460]   He said, "It is not for you to worry about that now,
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.420]   "because time will come.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.020]   "When the fullness of time has come,
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.840]   "God is going to reveal His glory,
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.200]   "and you will be glorified with Him when He comes in glory.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.360]   "But until then, it is not time for you
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.660]   "to worry about that now.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.700]   "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you."
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.960]   So therefore, even in our prayers,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.360]   what causes us to be urgent in our prayers
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.660]   is the Great Commission.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.940]   Is when we are laboring and praying
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.420]   for the gospel to be spread.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.400]   That's something that you and I cannot do.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.740]   I can pay bills without praying.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.220]   I can get a job in promotion without praying.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.740]   Work harder, stop being lazy.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.300]   Don't make trouble at work.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.980]   Read and get educated.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.540]   I could, we know all the information,
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.380]   but the primary reason why we have to pray,
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.500]   why prayer becomes urgent,
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.560]   is when we're in the context of battle.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.380]   And I love what John Piper says about this in prayer.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.060]   He says, "Prayer primarily is not an intercom
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.060]   "to share our thoughts with one another,
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.640]   "but it is like a walkie-talkie in a time of war.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.900]   "There's somebody in the front line
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.840]   "is communicating with their commanding officer
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.260]   "back and forth, what should we do?"
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.980]   And so if we're not engaged in the Great Commission,
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.300]   it just becomes an intercom.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.460]   It just becomes texting,
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.020]   and how you doing, what's going on?
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.580]   And eventually it gets old, and there's no urgency.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.820]   See, our prayer life is directly linked
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.660]   to the Great Commission.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.220]   2 Thessalonians 3.10, "Finally, brothers,
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.940]   "pray for us that the word of the Lord
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.920]   "may speed ahead and be honored as happened among you."
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.900]   The very purpose of our prayer
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.500]   is directly linked to the Great Commission.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.420]   Purpose of the church.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.480]   In Matthew 16.18, Jesus says,
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.160]   "In the inauguration of the church,
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.680]   "I tell you, Peter, and on this rock,
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.980]   "I will build my church, and the gates of hell
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.940]   "shall not prevail against it."
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.820]   If you notice the way he says that,
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.860]   he's not saying that he's going to build a fortress
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.980]   that hell cannot penetrate.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.260]   What he says is, the gates of hell
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.700]   cannot withstand the church.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.300]   So who's on the defense?
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.100]   Not the church.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.380]   He didn't say, "I'm gonna build a church,
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.820]   "and I'm gonna create this fortress,
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.040]   "and I'm gonna protect everyone inside the church."
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.220]   He didn't say that.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.980]   He said, "I'm gonna build this church,
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.160]   "and the gates of Hades, hell,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.180]   "we're not gonna be able to withstand
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.960]   "the coming of the light."
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.500]   One of my favorite quotes from Torrey Tamboon.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.880]   And I've quoted this so many times,
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.080]   but one of my favorite quotes,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.140]   "There's no darkness that Satan can create
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.960]   "that the love of God cannot penetrate."
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.920]   That's exactly what Jesus was saying.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.360]   There is no darkness in the world
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.620]   that the gospel cannot penetrate.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.960]   And when we go to India,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.320]   that's a living testimony of that.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.840]   Out in a place where Hinduism
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.800]   has been around for thousands of years,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.440]   where people are literally being killed
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.000]   in sharing the gospel,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.320]   and people are coming to Christ.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.160]   I was just thinking,
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.840]   while the last day we were running VBS,
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.080]   a bunch of kids coming around,
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.400]   and because they're so poor,
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.920]   anything free, they get in line.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.800]   And so they were passing out little bracelets
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.240]   with different colors to share the gospel.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.720]   And not only the children,
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.200]   but all the parents were coming,
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.680]   and they said, "We want one, we want one."
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.520]   So I was thinking,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.880]   "What are they gonna do with these beads?"
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.880]   They're not Christian, but it's free.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.320]   They want it, so I'm sure they'll figure out
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.680]   some use for it.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.960]   But there was this one little kid,
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.780]   and he was probably no more than about 10 years old.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.000]   All the kids are fighting each other to get these beads,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.320]   but he was standing in line, and he wouldn't get it.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.520]   So he said, "Hey, you can get it.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.360]   "They'll give you one."
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.800]   He said, "I don't want it."
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.360]   And so we asked him, "How come you don't want it?"
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.120]   And he said, "I'm not a Christian."
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.080]   That's for Christians, "I'm not a Christian."
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.920]   And I was thinking to myself,
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.040]   that kid didn't come up with that by himself.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.360]   His parents probably told him that.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.240]   His parents probably told him,
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.160]   just like Pastor Saki said about his daughter's friends.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.400]   Don't take anything from them,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.600]   'cause they're Christian.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:38.120]   The thought came to me that all of these kids
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.680]   want these beads, and they're,
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   because of our presence, they're open to the gospel,
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.620]   they're hearing the gospel,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.480]   they're getting eye care, and they're talking to,
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.040]   you know, maybe people who would have never
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.720]   had any kind of interaction with these pastors
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.520]   because of our presence, they were there.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.200]   But typically, because of that one kid,
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.480]   because of the parents' hostility to that one parent,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.760]   we say, "Oh, we can't go there."
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.880]   Right?
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.320]   The hostility is not with everybody.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.680]   Majority of the people there are pretty open.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.400]   But because of the hostility of the few,
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.960]   whether that's in India,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.680]   whether that's in the Middle East,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.820]   all the other people don't get to hear the gospel,
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.060]   because one family member in that village says,
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.220]   "Don't go," 'cause they're hostile to the gospel.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.700]   And I just kind of thought about that and said,
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.820]   you know, we have probably,
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.660]   for every person that's hostile to the gospel,
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.340]   you probably have thousands of people
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.640]   who are eager to hear it.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.620]   Is that gonna prevent us from going?
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:39.820]   Is that gonna prevent us from taking the gospel there?
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.340]   And I'll be honest with you,
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.900]   every time I go, you know, I'm a little bit anxious.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.920]   The first time we went out to China,
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.300]   there's a few of you who was with us
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.300]   when we first went to China.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.560]   I was a little anxious then,
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.860]   because this is when the Communist Party was very present,
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.540]   and prior to that, all I saw was military presence.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.460]   And so we thought, well, the door is open,
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.300]   let's see what happens.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.460]   And we went, and then that kind of opened the door,
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.460]   and now Pastor Alex and his family's out there
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.860]   trying to establish a community there.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.780]   But India is another level.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.100]   We're going to an area where we don't have any contact,
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.820]   and if anything happens, we're a five-hour drive away.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.840]   So it's not that I'm reckless
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.660]   and I don't think about these things,
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.460]   but we went because the door opened.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.100]   And there's people who are in dire need.
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.620]   And again, we're there to support these pastors,
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.820]   and whatever they need,
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.820]   we're gonna do our best to support them.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:37.020]   But now India is no longer a project, it's very personal.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   Because they become friends.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.340]   So when I think of persecution now,
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.220]   I'm not thinking about Indian people,
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:48.220]   I'm thinking about Pastor Matthew, David, Sake, James,
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.860]   some of the people, some of the pastors that we met.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.820]   And I just can't get that out of my mind,
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.000]   thinking that possibly, you know,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.420]   one of these days I'm gonna get an email
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.560]   saying that something happened,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.300]   and now my heart is engaged.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.780]   My heart was not engaged in the beginning,
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.460]   it was just out of obedience.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.580]   But now my heart is engaged.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.860]   It's very personal now that these are friends of ours
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.260]   that are risking safety and their children
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.500]   to get the gospel out.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.300]   And I pray that we could support them.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.780]   But I wanna wrap up with this.
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.980]   Paul evaluated everything in his life, in his ministry,
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.640]   with the Great Commission.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.920]   Even while he was sitting in prison.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.700]   In Philippians 1, 12 to 14, he says,
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.680]   "I want you to know, brothers,
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.280]   "that what has happened to me
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.180]   "has really served to advance the gospel."
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.260]   He's not talking about him sitting in prison
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.220]   and what he has planned, he just says,
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.860]   "As long as the gospel is preached,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.980]   "whether people do it out of pretense or good purpose,
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.060]   "as long as the gospel is preached."
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.260]   He says, "Because of my imprisonment,
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.900]   "even though it was one person going around village to village
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.700]   "and one person's sacrifice,
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.380]   "and all these other people became more bold.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.700]   "And because of that, I thank God."
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.140]   Paul evaluated everything based upon
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.740]   the effectiveness of the gospel.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.580]   A success of a church, again,
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.580]   is not the growth of the church, right?
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.680]   Just numerical value.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.540]   The success of the church in and of itself
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.020]   is not simply, "Oh, we're so well organized.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.380]   "We have so many people that love one another."
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.500]   I don't know about you, but I've been to
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.960]   Buddhist organizations where they love each other.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.400]   I don't know about you, but I've been to places,
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.800]   I've been to, you know, like Muslim centers
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.300]   where they're super organized, right?
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.980]   The success of the church is directly linked
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.900]   to the Great Commission.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.060]   And that's what Paul says.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.280]   And I want to leave you with this,
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.580]   because this is what this trip,
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.220]   like it caused me to think.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.540]   And it's still remaining with me.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.180]   You know, Pastor Sake is the guy that I had contact with.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.180]   And so I've been emailing back and forth with him
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.820]   for the last five years, and then,
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.780]   actually, last two years, we were able to go.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.580]   Now we have a personal relationship.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.140]   But Pastor Sake is kind of like the middle child
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.940]   of three children, and I think maybe that's why
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.660]   it's easier for me to connect with him, right?
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.540]   And it was so funny, 'cause I asked him, like,
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.580]   "Did your older brother beat you when you were young?"
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.620]   And he just, matter of fact, "Yes."
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   And I said, "Did you torture your younger brother?"
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.300]   Which is Pastor David, and he just says, "Of course."
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.860]   That's what he said.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.180]   And I was like, "Yes, this guy understands."
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.020]   Why not, right?
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.660]   It's like, anyway, so he was sharing this,
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.040]   and the reason why I like talking to Pastor David,
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.240]   Pastor Sake is the mouthpiece of this family.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240]   He's the one presenting.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.200]   Whenever there's a presentation, he's the one translating.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.160]   But Pastor David is the one, the younger brother,
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.800]   who was abused all his life, and so when he,
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.400]   he's the introvert, you know, he only,
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   usually talks when you ask him a question.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.560]   He doesn't really initiate.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.200]   And then when you do ask him a question,
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.480]   he just says things matter of fact, right?
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.680]   He just says it, just says it.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.200]   He doesn't think about, like, how is this gonna come across?
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.760]   He just says it, right?
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.840]   And so I think one of the guys asked him, like,
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.440]   what was the hardest thing, you know,
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.160]   the craziest thing that you experienced?
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.600]   And he said, "Oh, you know, we run into cobras."
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.240]   And he says, "Yeah, you know, one time,
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.480]   "we had to run from a tiger, you know."
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.560]   But it's just the way he talks.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.480]   Like, "Yeah, run from a tiger,
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.240]   "and then we went and ate lunch."
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   And, you know, and usually he's just very matter of fact.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.340]   Right?
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.760]   So he doesn't talk about the hardship and persecution,
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.760]   like, "Oh, it's so hard."
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.680]   He just, he just says, "Yeah, it's hard.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.320]   "You know, we can't pay bills."
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.280]   That's it, the end.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.400]   You know, usually that's how the conversation goes.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.780]   But one thing that, in the context of talking to him,
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.480]   that he said to me, again, he said it just in passing,
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.040]   that really stuck with me.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.440]   I asked him about the hardship of persecution.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.580]   He says, "Yeah, persecution is growing."
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.440]   And he mentioned a specific incident that happened
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.280]   not that long ago.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.480]   It's not near his home, but it's maybe about the distance
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.720]   between here and NorCal, but it's in that same state.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.520]   And he said, "A Christian got beaten and killed.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.940]   "Last year in that same area, I got an email
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.680]   "from one of our contacts in Bangalore
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.280]   "asking us to pray for them, because two of their pastors
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.000]   "going into the village basically got jumped,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.560]   "and they had their teeth knocked out,
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.860]   "and both their legs broke in.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.780]   "And so they were in the hospital
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.900]   "asking us to pray for them.
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.320]   "This is right before we went.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.520]   "I got this email.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.100]   "I didn't share it with our team,
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.200]   "'cause I didn't wanna freak them out."
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.560]   But basically, this same thing happened
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.520]   in that similar area.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.200]   Again, it's about five hours drive from where they are.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.440]   And he said, "Yeah, it wasn't reported in the media,
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.380]   "but all the Christians know about it.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.960]   "So they got jumped and they got killed."
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.760]   And he said, "We see persecution coming."
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.540]   And where Pastor Sake lives is the next hotbed
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.680]   of this persecution.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.960]   And when he says persecution coming,
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.160]   he's not talking about people throwing rocks
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.920]   and beating them, because they're already experiencing
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.760]   that in the village.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.240]   When he says persecution, he's talking about death.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.360]   He says, "We see it coming."
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.000]   And again, like I said, he says it very matter of fact.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.400]   He just kinda says it like, "This is it."
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.000]   "We see persecution coming, but we're not afraid.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.640]   "We're gonna keep doing God's work."
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.840]   And he just says that.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.480]   And then we just go back to eating.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.080]   (audience laughs)
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.200]   And when he said that, as I was eating,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.120]   I was just thinking, "Wow, this is real to them."
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.760]   To us, it's a theory.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.420]   It's things that we read about.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.000]   We go there for a week and we come back
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.680]   and we're affected by it.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.120]   And they're living in the context of this every day,
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.920]   and they could easily fix the problem.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.240]   Stop preaching the gospel.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.620]   Stop going to these villages.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.520]   Practice your faith in your home
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.200]   with the Christians who are already Christians,
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.000]   and just encourage each other to stay faithful.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.400]   All they have to do is stop going to these villages.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.760]   Stop preaching the gospel.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.640]   But just as a matter of fact, we see persecution coming,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.680]   but we're not afraid.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.520]   And their fellowship is embedded in my head
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.280]   because I saw the 32 pastors.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.280]   Last year, we didn't know who they were until the last day,
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.440]   but I knew right away.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.860]   And I was able to see the interaction.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.720]   Their interaction was no different than the way we interact.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.200]   I was with Pastor Alex and we're joking around, having fun.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.040]   And it's typically like that when all the coworkers
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.120]   would be gathered together.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.620]   And our team, we just hang around.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.720]   We're having a lot of fun.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.040]   And we saw their interactions as a bunch of friends.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.280]   These pastors risking everything to go to the villages,
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.120]   share the gospel.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.720]   And as I was looking at that, I said,
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.920]   wow, these guys are no different than us,
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.280]   but they're risking everything to get the gospel out.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.340]   So I come back this trip and I ask you to pray
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.040]   that God would make it clear to us how to proceed.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.600]   And to me, it seems clear that these are people
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.040]   we need to get behind.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.440]   And to partner, again, not just financially.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.520]   Finance is the easiest part, right?
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.000]   How, knowing these people personally,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.280]   how is it gonna affect my life?
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.960]   How is it gonna affect your life?
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.840]   And I pray that as a church,
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.640]   that we would not simply onlookers and just clap hands
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.560]   and saying, God, thank you for these people.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.840]   But that you and I would also heed the commandment
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.600]   that's given to us.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.720]   And that God would give us a heart as we obey.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.000]   So can you take some time to pray with me this morning
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.160]   as I welcome the priest in back.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.440]   Just take a minute, I know a lot of time has already gone.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.200]   Take a minute to examine our lives.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.320]   And I wanna ask you, some of the frustration
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.920]   that you feel as a Christian,
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.460]   how much of that is related to what I said this morning?
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.080]   That you feel a disconnect in your walk with God.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.280]   You come to church, you serve,
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.500]   you're in the midst of fellowship around the church,
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.400]   you're serving the church even, but there's a disconnect.
