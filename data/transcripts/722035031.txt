[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.560]   Can you turn with me to Philippians chapter 4?
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.000]   And happy Father's Day for everyone.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.560]   This sermon isn't about fathers, but I hope that because it's to everyone, and I guess
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.240]   it includes you, make sure to pick up the photo frames and the gift, and you are very
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.240]   appreciated.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.520]   Hope you feel very loved by your family this day.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.880]   Now, we're not going to read this just yet, but I wanted to open by kind of mentioning
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.760]   the title of the sermon, "Where is Your Mind?"
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.240]   And the thought of what we're thinking upon is so much more than just the passing thoughts.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.880]   The question I'm asking is more the passage we're going to be looking at, which is what
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.740]   are we dwelling on?
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.600]   What have we been largely, regularly, deeply thinking about lately?
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.120]   And those are the things that are going to be very important for us to consider, especially
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.240]   in this day and age where we're constantly bombarded by all the noise of culture and
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.400]   everything that's going on.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.720]   And there's not a one of us.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.240]   It doesn't matter, like if we're not on technology, we're just constantly being bombarded by so
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.520]   much.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.560]   And we have to be made aware of this and understand that as things are coming, if we're just passively
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.880]   allowing these things to wash over us and there is no movement there, and then we come
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.600]   to God to worship and say that we surrender our lives to Him without actively surrendering
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.960]   our thoughts and our thinking and our dwelling and our meditating, then we are in for a losing
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.960]   battle.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.200]   And so I wanted to address this today, especially in the realm, I guess, of like the smartphone.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.000]   Everywhere we go, everywhere we go, we have things just in us.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.200]   I know a lot of us have those earbuds, constantly music and podcasts.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.840]   You're in the car and you're listening to things.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.000]   It's very difficult to find yourself in a place where there's nothing to kind of bombard
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.400]   you with.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.160]   There's that common fear nowadays where if you go to the bathroom, you don't have your
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   phone on you.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   You're like, "Oh, no."
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.720]   You know, there's those kind of fears that are there.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.480]   And it's because of this generation that we live in.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.000]   But it is not, I don't think it's the Bible's silent about it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.840]   I think the Bible has already addressed it.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.600]   And we need to be made aware of this.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   A man by the name Alistair Begg, he says this, he says, "Our thoughts reveal more about the
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.760]   true character of our lives than any other thing.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.280]   When our actions follow our thinking, then we give testimony to our thoughts.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880]   But when we conceal our thoughts known only to God and ourselves, they are a true monitor
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.280]   of who we are and what we are."
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.000]   And I think that was very convicting a statement because we can very easily change our words
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.360]   and we can present ourselves to one another, but our thoughts are our thoughts.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.960]   What we're dwelling on, honestly speaking, I have no idea what you've been dwelling on
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.160]   for many of you.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.560]   Some of you, yes, but not all of you.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.000]   And if we're to look around, how many people know what you've been actually actively thinking
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.480]   on, dwelling upon?
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.120]   And they might not know.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   On the other hand, they might know very well what you've been dwelling on, right?
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.980]   And that's not so much a comfort either because you're always angry, you know, or like you're
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.360]   always like talking about this thing that you've been dwelling on.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.840]   That's not good either.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.560]   And so there are these things about our thoughts that I think I wanted to just really address
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.760]   today because it's been something that has constantly been plaguing me, especially, not
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.560]   selective to, but especially the last few years and the craziness that we've been seeing
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.480]   around us.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.360]   So again, title of the sermon, "Where is Your Mind?"
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.920]   It's going to require you to ask this of yourself.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.840]   Like what have you been actively dwelling on?
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.320]   What are these recurring thoughts, these things that have been captivating your attentions
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.360]   and your motivations have been being affected by your thoughts?
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.680]   These things that have causing emotions to erupt inside of you, what is that?
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.960]   And the question that follows that is, are they appropriate to the Christian?
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.520]   Have they been causing in you the fruit of the Spirit?
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.400]   Can you say, looking at the thoughts of your heart, that this is unto God's glory?
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.640]   That these thoughts are actively, I can see the change and the good that it causes in
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.080]   me and those around me.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.040]   Let me read for us Philippians chapter 4 verse 8.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.960]   "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.680]   is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.560]   if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.080]   The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.160]   and the God of peace will be with you."
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   Let's pray.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.840]   Heavenly Father, I pray that we would be a thinking, dwelling people.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.680]   But the things in which we think and dwell upon would be the things that pertain to You.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.360]   Father, help us.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.320]   We're in such great need of Your care.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.040]   Holy Spirit, we need You to be changing us inside.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.880]   And Father, would You cause us to be people who would obediently respond.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.840]   All right, three points today.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.440]   First point is that we dwell on things.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.880]   And what I mean by this is that as humans, we dwell on things.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.720]   This is just a given.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   And that's the word that's being talked about there at the end of verse 8 when it says,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.160]   "Dwell on these things."
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.220]   That word dwell is think.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.200]   Now this passage, it begins with, "Finally, brethren."
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.840]   And the reason why it's because this is kind of an umbrella term and it kind of starts
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.840]   to push together everything that he's been talking about.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   We find that word also in the beginning of chapter 3.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.440]   And so he's using it as a device to help kind of push everything together and say, "Here
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   we go."
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.120]   And he says, "Finally, brethren."
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.600]   And he delves into these things that he calls us to think upon.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.300]   Philippians chapter 1 through 3, we already saw and many of us are very familiar that
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.460]   the Apostle Paul is writing this in the presence of when he's in prison, right?
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.060]   And so he's displaying to the church of Philippi the hope that he has and what he desires for
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.220]   them to have.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.380]   And that's a very challenging thing for people who are living their lives to be receiving
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.380]   a letter from a brother who's in jail, right, who's been suffering.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.980]   And for him to tell them, "Be joyful."
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.580]   That's so challenging, isn't it?
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.420]   So challenging because you begin to look at your lives like, "What right do I have in
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:46.740]   the presence that I'm in to not be joyful when Paul's in prison saying, 'Be joyful.'"
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.340]   And so, but that's kind of what's going on here.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.180]   And then in Philippians chapter 4 verse 1, at the beginning there, I think that imperative,
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.860]   "Stand firm, therefore, my beloved brethren, whom I long to see my joy in my crown.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.500]   In this way, stand firm in the Lord, my beloved."
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.740]   That imperative pushes off into a litany of other imperatives that I think all fall under
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.100]   the main imperative of stand firm.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:15.340]   He's telling them how not to just be taken this way and that way, how to be resolute
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.260]   and convicted and strong and foundational.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.380]   How it doesn't matter if we're up or we're down, if we're in places of dire need or we're
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.240]   in places of great abundance.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.600]   He's showing us what it looks like and how we're called to live unmoving and stable because
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.360]   of something that we have in Jesus Christ.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.640]   That's where we get this.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   He says, "Dwell."
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.160]   The word dwell is a command to us.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.740]   To dwell, Paul knew that as humans we dwell on things.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.220]   It's part of what it is to be humans.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.920]   There are those of us who are deep thinkers.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.240]   We lay down in bed before sleeping and the thoughts just like this, chasing the tail.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.560]   It's hard to turn it off.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.640]   And there are those who are just like very simple-minded.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.040]   You might think like, "Oh, I'm not a thinker."
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.560]   We're all thinkers.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.880]   We all dwell on things.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.120]   He's speaking into the human reality.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.480]   Dwell.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.640]   In the LSB, it says consider.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.400]   In most other translations though, it just says think.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.120]   To think upon this list that we're going to be going into in a moment.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.820]   This word dwell means to calculate or to reason over, to ponder, to remember, to bear in mind.
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.360]   It's something that's so important to you that you're revisiting it multiple times over
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   and over again.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.880]   It's not a passing thought.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.240]   That's not what this is saying.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.000]   When he's saying, "Think upon these things," he's saying, "Go deep into it."
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.960]   Because as humans, going deep into things is what we do.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.480]   It's something that we've deemed worthy enough or important enough to think about.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.240]   It's to think about something in detail and logical manner.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.320]   Perhaps through the day we're thinking and we find ourselves browsing over the topic
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.760]   over the course of time.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.840]   Perhaps our checkbooks will display the things that we're thinking upon.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.680]   Perhaps our Google search histories will tell us the things that we're dwelling upon and
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.000]   thinking upon.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.760]   What is it that we've been consuming?
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.920]   What is it that we've been hitting over and over and over again?
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.960]   This is what we do as humans.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.200]   I'm part of this club.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.640]   It's called the Panera Sip Club.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.640]   You get kind of free drinks.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.800]   It's kind of cool.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.320]   You go and then up through July something, I need to remember to cancel my subscription,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.040]   but you go and then every two hours you get a free drink.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.160]   In the beginning, I was like, "This is wonderful."
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.120]   I'm like, "Oh, I got to be careful."
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.640]   Now I go and I just get tea, I get hot tea.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   There are six different teas.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   They're all just tea.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   Tea is tea to me.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.680]   Coffee is coffee to me.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.720]   What I found is I found myself just looking at these teas because I have to kind of change
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   it up.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.920]   I've tried all the different teas.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.320]   All these teas there, it was very interesting.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.200]   None of them had strings on them.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.440]   Because they don't have strings on them, they give you a tong.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.240]   With these tongs, you pull it out.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240]   It's a little tea bag.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.400]   You just kind of put it in scalding, like hot water.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.720]   It's really hot.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.200]   Then you just let it sit there.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.040]   When I first joined this club, I drank it in the beginning because I like hot tea.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.520]   Then when I drink it, I'm like, "Oh, that doesn't taste like it's steeped long enough."
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.960]   Over time, I would figure out like, "Oh, I got to wait this much time before it's steeped
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.080]   enough, it's bold enough."
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.400]   There were times when I would come back to it three hours later and take a sip and it's
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   really gross.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.840]   And so you'd look at it.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:59.120]   When you look at it steeping, I think something very interesting is occurring because I think
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.360]   I actively saw this two weeks ago.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   I was just watching it.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   It was too hot.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.920]   I was just watching my tea bag steep and I'm like, "That's my heart."
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.720]   That's what my heart is doing.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.480]   I was watching it.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:19.160]   Because we have a tendency with our hearts to really easily just kind of dip into things.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.400]   And whatever we dip into, whatever happens to them, nothing much happens.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.120]   When we dip, it's just...
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.800]   It's gross.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   If you were to be served tea that has been just...
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.640]   It's an inflation and the Panera baristas are like, "Oh, we're running out.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.800]   Let me give you some tea."
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.960]   And they just give you a dipped tea and they hand this thing over to you and drink it.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.040]   "Oh, this is not steeped long enough."
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.240]   And so we know that when we look at this kind of tea, there's something that happens the
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.380]   longer you steep inside of it.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.440]   And I think the heart is very much that.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:03.560]   When he's saying, "Think upon, dwell, meditate, ruminate, ponder," he's saying actually steep
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:10.280]   in it because our hearts are very much connected to our thinking.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.640]   In fact, when we think of our heart, when we think of what it means to give God our
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:21.760]   heart, it's not that Western understanding of emotions.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.200]   We might even know that, but I don't think we all do that.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.080]   There are many of us who might come and say, "Here's my heart."
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.200]   And what we're displaying, what we're giving up to God, what we're surrendering are our
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.820]   emotions, how we feel.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.920]   And so when we say, "God, change our hearts," we're asking Him to change how I feel.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.760]   But I don't think the Bible talks about the heart just as our feelings.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.700]   In fact, it's threefold.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.960]   It talks about the heart in the Bible as being emotions, your affections and your feelings,
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.680]   but it also talks about your heart as being your will.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.440]   Those are your actions or your behavior.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.800]   It's the manifestations.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.600]   It's what you do, that your heart is very much connected to intention.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.280]   And then your mind, and that's what we're talking about here in this word, your thinking,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.840]   your logic, and your rationale, and all three of these things are intricately tied to your
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.080]   heart, and they together make up your heart, and you cannot pull them apart from each other.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.040]   They all affect each other.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:27.280]   And so when we give up our hearts to God, it's all of it.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.240]   Now with your emotions, for example, then, how does it connect with your will?
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:38.840]   Well, it connects with your will very clearly because when you're depressed, like what your
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.520]   behavior looks like and how you act, the things you do, the decisions you make, all those
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.640]   things become very much affected, don't they?
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.940]   Depression will definitely affect your actions.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.040]   If you're in fear, it's going to cause you to act rashly or cautiously maybe.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.600]   If you're happy, it's going to cause you to act generously.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.800]   When you're sad, maybe selfishly.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   So you begin to base so much of your will and intention on how you feel.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.600]   Your emotions, though, also affect your thinking.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.540]   It's not difficult to see this.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.920]   Just talk to any lovesick person.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.320]   Their hearts are so emotional, so filled with feeling that they begin to talk nonsense,
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.320]   right?
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.360]   And then it affects the way they live and it affects the way they think.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.960]   The love of their life started dating someone else and gets married to someone else.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.920]   And then just look at that person and see how it affects their thinking.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.240]   I will never get married.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.280]   I will never be happy ever again in my life.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.680]   I am going to die alone and a loser.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.760]   And you're like sitting there, you're like, "What are you talking about right now?"
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:52.320]   You see like your affections begin to change your thinking.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.800]   All this to say, your thinking, and because that's what we're talking about today, the
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.480]   thinking, the thinking actually affects your will.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.880]   And the thinking actually affects your emotions.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.960]   Because this all has to do with the control center of the human being, the heart.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.200]   In Philippians chapter 4, verse 8, let's look at it again.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.440]   "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.960]   whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:21.880]   worthy of praise, dwell, think, meditate, ruminate upon the things that were just written
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.880]   above."
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.480]   This is a command.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:34.800]   And this necessitates a couple of things because number one, if it's a command, it's a command.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.080]   It's a command from God.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.320]   He's telling you to do this.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.220]   It's not something where he says, "Think about it," and then go like, "Okay, like come back
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.360]   to me when you want to obey or not."
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.040]   He's saying, "Obey this."
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.840]   It is an expectation upon us.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.440]   We must dwell on these things.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.200]   But also, a second thing that comes up with this is that we're given a choice.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.600]   I think that's very clear too.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:09.320]   We're given this choice there to obey or to disobey.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.360]   The command is here because of the threat that there is to the human mind.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.960]   In 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 4, it says, "In whose case the God of this world has blinded
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.200]   glory of Christ who is the image of God."
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.720]   Now, he could have easily have said, the Apostle Paul here, "In whose case the God of this
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.320]   world has blinded the eyes or the heart."
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.560]   Or he could have just said, "He's blinded them."
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.160]   But he specifically says, "He's blinded the minds of the unbelieving."
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   Why?
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.120]   "So that they might not see the light of the gospel."
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.440]   And then he says something very interesting, "Who is the image of God."
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.560]   So what that means is there's something intricately connected with our thinking and with our sight,
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.000]   right?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.520]   With our thinking, with what we perceive to be reality.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.600]   It's not disconnected.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.200]   And so when we fill our thoughts with something, will it not affect us?
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.600]   Of course it will.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.000]   That's why our affections are changed.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.840]   That's why sometimes we know something is right or wrong, and we will continue to do
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:25.440]   maybe what is wrong, even though we know in our thought process that this is wrong.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.760]   It affects us.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.120]   Here it's saying that Satan is blinding the minds of the unbelieving people so that they
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.680]   wouldn't see the light of the gospel.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.560]   And they have no choice in the matter.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.920]   They're blind.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.200]   In Psalm 115 verse 4, see what happens to the unbelieving people.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.880]   Their idols are silver and gold, the work of man's hands.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.320]   They have mouths, but they cannot speak.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.320]   They have eyes, but they cannot see.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.680]   They have ears, but they cannot hear.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   They have noses, but they cannot smell.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   They have hands, but they cannot feel.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.440]   They have feet, but they cannot walk.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.760]   They cannot make a sound with their throat.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.200]   Those who make them will become like them.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.720]   I wanted to highlight that.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.640]   Those who make these idols will become like them, everyone who trusts in them.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.800]   I like to think about this as like the unbelieving way of sanctification.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.400]   It's like the believer's way of sanctification where we're going to look at that in just
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.640]   a moment where we're sanctified into the image of Christ, but with the unbelieving people,
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.120]   those who make them will become like them.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   Now let me turn our attentions here to the believer because the believer can see, right?
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.220]   We have seen the light of the gospel.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.480]   We have seen the glory of Christ.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.560]   We have seen all these things, and this is our reality.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:44.240]   So 2 Corinthians 4, verse 16, "Therefore," it says, "we do not lose heart, but though
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.360]   our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.680]   For momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.800]   all comparison while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   not seen.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:12.600]   And verse 18, we come across a choice because this is talking to the believer, and he's
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.720]   saying we look not at the things which are seen.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.880]   That is actually our reality.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:28.360]   We are people of light, and we're thinking, "But at the things which are not seen," right?
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.000]   The eternal things.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.240]   So right before this, in 2 Corinthians 3, he says, "But we all, with unveiled face,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.840]   beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.400]   image from glory to glory, justice from the Lord, the Spirit."
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.840]   Now I bring up all this because for the believer, there is an intentional choice we can make
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:59.920]   to behold and to see and to think, to ruminate upon and to dwell on.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.560]   And there's something about the clearer sight that we have of God that causes us to become
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.960]   more like Him.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.200]   Now my question to you is this, what happens when the believer, not the unbeliever, when
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:18.400]   the believer chooses to dwell upon the worldly things?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.880]   What's going to happen?
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:28.600]   Well for the unbeliever, it says, "They become like them."
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.480]   What about the believer?
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.160]   Something to think about there.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.040]   And so what we're called to hear with this idea of the mind is to, when we say we want
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.480]   to give God our whole hearts, we need to give Him everything we're thinking, everything
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.860]   we've been thinking.
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.300]   Every thought is His.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.880]   And this is powerful because I think what many times what we try to do is give Him our
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.100]   feelings.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.360]   We say, "Here it is, change it."
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.400]   And we have our hands up, I say, "I surrender."
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.700]   But how can God take a portion of your heart?
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.480]   He can only take all of it, right?
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.680]   He only demands all of it, right?
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:17.080]   We cannot say, "Change this," but I get to think upon the things I want to think upon.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.940]   Change me despite me.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.540]   Is that how sanctification works?
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.380]   No, it works in obedience to what's happening.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.180]   And the scriptures tell us how that looks.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.980]   That's why in Matthew 22, verse 37, it says, "You shall love the Lord your God."
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.380]   He could have stopped there.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.660]   Actually, how sad a thing it is that He can't stop there.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.080]   He has to describe what it is to love.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.940]   This should be a given to us, but He describes it with all your heart, and He describes it
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.860]   some more with all your soul, and with all your mind.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.220]   We can just look at this and be like, "Hey, let's wipe this all together," and just be
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.020]   like He just wants all of us.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.660]   True, but let's take this time to think about it.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.500]   It's all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:06.700]   Let's consider the mind because it's part of your heart.
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:12.460]   And so to dwell is a command to us to think in a different way because it affects our
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.820]   hearts and it's mentioned quite frequently in Scripture if we were to look at it.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.620]   Colossians chapter 3, verse 1, "Therefore, if you have been raised up with Christ, keep
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.620]   seeking the things above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:28.380]   Set your," not heart, but set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.380]   on earth.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.500]   Romans 8, 5, "For those who are according to the flesh, set their minds on the things
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   of the flesh.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.460]   Those who are according to the things of the Spirit, for the mind set on the flesh is death,
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.060]   but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.820]   Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God, for it does not subject itself
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.660]   to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.140]   And those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.140]   Romans 12, 2, "And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.220]   of your," again, it's your mind, "so that you may prove what is the will of God, that
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.260]   which is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:07.580]   Even taking a moment to look at this, "That so that will show you that you cannot discern
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:15.060]   what is good and acceptable and perfect unless your mind is being renewed."
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.660]   Second Corinthians 10, 3, "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.660]   flesh.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.540]   For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.540]   of fortresses.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.500]   We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God,
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.660]   and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.740]   And we are ready to punish all disobedience whenever your obedience is complete."
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.780]   It's talking about speculations, it's talking about knowledge, it's talking about taking
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.940]   every thought captive.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.740]   There's a lot that has to do with this.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.060]   And there are a lot of like, by the way, this isn't like a word study where all of these
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.760]   words are the same words, but these words are very intricately coming together to show
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.300]   us the importance of our minds.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.780]   So what have you been thinking on?
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.860]   What have you been dwelling upon?
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.780]   What's been circulating?
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:18.660]   Have Christian godly thoughts been things we dip into like this?
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:26.600]   I'm going to list out some things that maybe, I tried to get a wide array here, maybe it's
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   music.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.580]   And music has been so, especially with the invention of the smartphone and wireless capabilities
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.100]   with our earbuds, it's pretty crazy.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.600]   You can now like put in your earbuds and be listening to music or even podcasts or whatever,
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   right?
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   These could be good things.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.160]   You're listening to it and then you get in the car and it automatically sometimes connects
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   to your car.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   Seamless, seamless transition.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.440]   You just keep listening.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:55.960]   And it's almost hard nowadays to get the quiet, right?
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.000]   Fashion.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.600]   We could be distracted and thinking upon fashion.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   This is not something I very much, for me it's like maybe like more like gadgetry.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.200]   What kind of lump these things all together?
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.720]   We go into these things and we go on websites and we just start scrolling and looking and
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.640]   researching.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:19.720]   And many of us know the lyrics to songs, 50 of them, or the capabilities of these gadgets
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:27.880]   or the latest trends so much more in a deeper way than we know scripture, right?
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:35.200]   It's kind of sad, but like there is a lot of that where we're able to kind of push out
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.600]   these things really quickly.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   Why?
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   Because we've been dwelling on those things.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.920]   Have we been dwelling on the things of God like we dwell on these things?
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.680]   I'm just pushing these things out, okay?
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.940]   By the way, this isn't like guilt trip time.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.200]   This is like, "Hey, let's just really think about what we've been thinking about."
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.720]   Movies, getting lost in these imaginary worlds.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.480]   I know there are some movies that when you're in it, when you come out of it, you're like
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.600]   dazed because you feel like you've been in a different world for three hours.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.320]   But there's a lot of this I thought was like so interesting.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.760]   When my wife and I were watching like one of, I think it was the latest Spider-Man movie,
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.360]   somebody told us we needed to know, or we read it somewhere or something, we needed
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.760]   to know all the other 50 Spider-Man movies that were out there.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.960]   And so we're like, "How are we supposed to do that?"
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.160]   And then I remember looking up one of the recap things, but they were like, they would
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.840]   go for like ever.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.560]   You know where you scroll and then that little bar thing goes only a little?
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.720]   Like, "Oh my gosh, this thing's really long."
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.440]   And so somebody sent us a YouTube video, and the YouTube video of recaps of all the other
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.360]   movies was like an hour and a half long.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.040]   I'm like, "What is this?"
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.200]   And it's just, we can get lost in these worlds even.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:50.680]   Shows, dramas, many people are into K-dramas and it sucks you in.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.600]   You weep like no tomorrow over some scene.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.640]   You look at these things and when it ends, you feel like your friends have died.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   They're gone.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.880]   Like we're so deep into these things because we're dwelling.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.200]   We're ruminating, we're meditating.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.040]   We've allowed our hearts to steep in it.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.840]   I'm not saying it's wrong to do these things.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.240]   I'm just saying, "Hey, can we travel together here and wonder what it is that we've been
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.640]   dwelling upon?"
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.720]   Video games.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.160]   Is this too like childish to talk about video games here?
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.560]   I don't think so because video games goes up to old ages now.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.240]   Video games, so many things.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.960]   As a youth pastor, I remember just being like, "What is happening?"
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.360]   Is there like, there isn't a world.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.080]   I know I'm like, I'm still a young guy but like so quickly everything was changing.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.920]   I remember one of the girls, my former youth students was like talking about a cat game
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.920]   where there's like a living room and you make this living room look really pretty and then
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.600]   cats come and they hang out and then they leave.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.320]   And she said like, "Yeah, yeah, I have a problem Pastor Nate because I bought something."
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.880]   I'm like, "What do you mean you bought something?"
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.880]   She said, "I bought this couch."
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   I'm like, "What do you mean you bought a couch?
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   It's a video game."
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.760]   She's like, "Yeah, you spent real money to buy a couch on this game?"
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.560]   She's like, "Yeah, but look at it though."
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.360]   And she was like, "I'm thinking about it too much."
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.480]   A few weeks later she came up and she's like, "I deleted the whole thing."
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   I'm like, "Why?"
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.000]   She was like, "I was thinking too much about it."
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.400]   I'm like, "Oh my gosh, we think so much about these things."
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   I'm right there.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.600]   I'm right there with it because there was a time like I was really into like fantasy
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.240]   football and fantasy basketball and things like that.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:29.640]   I'd be constantly thinking about it, constantly look up all the stats and it sucks you in.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:35.280]   One line, isn't it, between the dwelling, leisure, what about travel and vacation?
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.400]   For those close enough to taste it, what about retirement?
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.760]   What it might be like?
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.040]   Curating the best experiences that we can think of, devoting hours and hours, putting
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.600]   up, "Okay, I'm going here.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   Rex, please."
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.240]   And then we spend much time just looking at all the good places to eat, all the ways that
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.600]   we can succumb to every fleshly pleasure.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.800]   We're like just constantly thinking, "What are the best things that we can get out of
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   this world?"
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.640]   I'm not saying this is wrong, but we're all in this.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.000]   We're like goldfish in this water.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.080]   This is all around us, devoting hours and hours, fantasizing, weeks after weeks, months
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.840]   after months, years after years.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.880]   That's my place I want to go to before I die.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.280]   For me, it's New Zealand.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:28.440]   That's where I want to go, ruminating, meditating, and dwelling, even more so than heaven?
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.120]   You know, like there's a lot that we have to think about here.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.360]   In Hebrews 12, verse 1, it says, "Since we have, therefore, so great a cloud of witnesses
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.360]   surrounding us."
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:43.400]   And let me take a moment here to remind us of what came before in Hebrews 11.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.460]   That he's saying, "Think about these cloud of witnesses of faith," right?
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.840]   And he reminds us of what they walked and what they went through and how that ended
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.940]   in their lives.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.920]   They died for their faith.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.560]   Okay.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.520]   We take this back into our lives, and we're looking at this Hebrews 12, verse 1.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   "We have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us who have such great things."
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.480]   And then he says, "Let us also lay aside every encumbrance."
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:18.280]   And then we think, like, what are our encumbrances?
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.040]   How sad.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:27.000]   How sad that it's sports and leisure and vacations.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.640]   Do you guys feel what I'm saying?
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:36.520]   That here, he's saying, "We must lay aside every encumbrance and the sin," so both things,
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.840]   things that might distract us, "which so easily entangles us."
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.800]   In 2 Timothy 2, verse 4, "No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.880]   everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier."
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   Now, be careful here.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.280]   He's not saying it's wrong to entangle yourself in the affairs of everyday life.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.080]   He's saying it's wrong for the soldier, right?
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.440]   It's not wrong to take a nap, but it is if you're in the midst of war and you're the
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.960]   watchtower guy, right?
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.800]   It's being aware of reality.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.720]   It's not wrong to partake in the things of this world.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.680]   But we can't live in that, right?
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   Why?
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.640]   Because we're saying a war is raging around us.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.260]   We just completed 1 Peter.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:21.360]   We are saying there is a lion here that has been uncaged, and he is prowling.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.080]   How are we on our phones?
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   We're staring at this prowling lion, aren't we?
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.240]   You don't need to tell me twice.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:36.640]   I'm looking, because this is our reality.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.560]   Like I don't think this is a place where he's telling us to dwell on these good things.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:48.480]   He is not sitting there telling us on all the bad things not to dwell on, right?
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.680]   We have to pull this all out, because we have to think about this, because of how it's affecting
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.540]   us.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:00.760]   How much of us has gone into dwelling upon these worldly things that many of them aren't
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.680]   in themselves bad or evil, but we can very clearly say that we have gotten caught up
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.200]   in the affairs of everyday life, that we are getting tripped up by the encumbrances that
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.800]   are near.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.840]   And so the command to us to dwell on the good things is a command also negatively to say
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.160]   stop dwelling on those things.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:29.000]   They're a necessary two sides of the coin thing.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.760]   What about security things?
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   Politics?
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.880]   It's like it's overused now, but CNN or Fox, right?
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.480]   But I think nowadays it's like, "Oh, I'm not going to get caught this way or that way.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.720]   I'm going to be more balanced," and we found our independent news sources.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.800]   Same thing though.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:49.960]   Find yourself dwelling, meditating on all these independent sources, constantly perusing
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.560]   and feeling the need to stay up to date with everything that's happening in this world.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.200]   The thought of, "Oh, what about like children, the security of our children that we're getting
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.840]   caught up dwelling on their futures and their success, their safety, because this world
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.960]   is going down the drain."
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.180]   Relationships, what about are we dwelling on friendships, investing in the realm of
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.880]   pleasing man over God?
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.520]   What about romantic relationships, dwelling so much on certain individuals or dwelling
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.360]   on the need to date or to get engaged or get married?
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.640]   What about personal reputation?
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.280]   Also in the Christian sense that we can seek security in establishing something in front
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.880]   of others, establishing relationships amongst peers or the church.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:32.240]   What about our careers, so invested in moving up the ladder, growing not in godly ambition
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.520]   in career, but clearly and fleshly ambition in career, letting it bleed into the way we
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.740]   feel about ourselves and how we present to others.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.540]   Have we been dwelling in these things?
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.580]   What about our money?
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.820]   Have we been dwelling in money?
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.700]   Yeah, Bitcoin and Ethereum, you've been like, "No, don't talk about that today.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.700]   I'll bring it out."
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.840]   You're in big trouble, right?
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.400]   We've got to just ride it out.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.500]   We just got to ride it out.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   That's your hope.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.380]   You just got to hope.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.380]   Just got to ride it out.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.680]   What a lame hope.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.380]   Don't look at your 401k.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.820]   But is that what we've been dwelling on?
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.620]   We're looking at it and we're stressed about these things.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.380]   First John chapter 2 verse 15, he says, "Do not love the world, nor the things in the
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.380]   world."
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.540]   Now, if we were commanded in Matthew 22, where all the commandments are, "Love the Lord your
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.560]   God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind."
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.500]   When he says, "Do not love the world," it means do not love the world with all your
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.900]   heart and with all your soul and with all your mind as well.
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.540]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.260]   And he's saying then that there is no arbitrary place.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.180]   There is no neutral ground that if you do not love God and the things of God, then you
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.420]   are loving the world and the things of the world.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.460]   If you are not dwelling on God and the things of God, then you are dwelling on the things
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.100]   of the world and the things that it has to offer.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.940]   He says in verse 16, "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.340]   of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.660]   The world is passing away, and also its lusts.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:58.340]   But the one who does the will of God lives forever."
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:03.780]   What have you been dwelling on?
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.460]   Have you been dwelling on how bad the world is?
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.860]   Chiming in with the chorus that this world is going down the drain.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.220]   How everything is wrong.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.540]   Hypocritical judgment is going out.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.320]   Able to point out how wrong everyone else is.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.640]   To grab the people that we like to grab and say, "Boom!
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.640]   Look at what he said.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.340]   Let's see how wrong he is."
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.980]   And we continue pounding that drum.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.500]   And we continue bringing things in, into our world.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.700]   And building these things up where we're saturating ourselves and we're steeping in that.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:39.500]   Is that what you want to steep on?
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.900]   Perhaps we've grown angry and constantly frustrated that there is no place of Christian joy that
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.900]   unmarks us.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.700]   When people look at us, they go, "Ah, that guy's always just not happy."
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.060]   Mouth opens, complaining comes out.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.340]   Remember, this is the thought.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.820]   What about if you're able to keep your mouth shut?
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.140]   What would your heart speak?
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:11.780]   Ultimately, it's only in a place of humility, right, where you begin to see where you've
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.180]   been dwelling on the right things and not the wrong things.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:19.540]   You could say all the right things, but if you're coming from the wrong place, the whole
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.220]   thing is wrong.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.660]   We'll address that a little bit more too.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.660]   What have you been dwelling on?
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.100]   Have you been dwelling on sexually immoral things?
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.340]   Now we can get into the realm of sinful stuff.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:37.100]   What do you think is going to happen when you're steeping in pornography?
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.820]   What do you think is going to happen when you're constantly dwelling on things and you're
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:46.300]   having to justify it's okay to watch this show despite the questionable morals, despite
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.220]   the questionable scenes, and just look and be like, "No, but it's okay."
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:55.580]   What do you think is going to happen to your heart when it's all connected?
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:00.320]   You cannot pull those things apart.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.900]   So many things.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.420]   Now here's the cool thing about today's passage.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.140]   It doesn't say anything about what I just said, right?
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.860]   All the things we might have been steeping on.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.900]   The cool thing about today's passage is not just pounding about everything that we're
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.180]   doing wrong.
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:22.420]   It's saying, it's reminding, it's commanding us to look at that which is beautiful.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.700]   This is important.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.500]   So when we look at all the wrong things, it might not produce the righteousness of God
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:34.340]   in you.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.500]   For the unbeliever, they become like them.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.540]   Their minds are blinded.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.580]   For the believer, we are given a choice to dwell and to ruminate on these things.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.140]   Now as a quick side note, we're not talking about positive thinking, Robert Shuler stuff,
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.140]   okay?
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.620]   We're not thinking like we have to, positive thinking is going to change us.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.620]   It's not that.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.620]   We're talking about the word of God.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.860]   So let's go to the second point.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.740]   We must dwell on godly things.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.140]   So we know that we're all dwellers.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.140]   We're all dwelling on something.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.460]   I hope we're in agreement with that.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.860]   We're all dwelling on something.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.940]   Now he's telling us what to dwell on.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.200]   And here's the list.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.620]   And whenever he gives a list, remember that he is giving special attention to each thing
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.620]   on the list.
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:10.980]   It's not for us to say like, good things, godly things, let's just dwell on that.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.100]   That's the command to us.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.100]   No.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.180]   If we're supposed to think and ruminate and meditate and saturate and seep and steep and
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:22.100]   dwell on these things, then we have need to engage our minds and to look at each of these
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.100]   words.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:28.340]   And I know that our minds have become very American, like couch potato minds when it
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.500]   comes to the things of God's word.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.980]   I know that because when I came back to this passage and I was looking at each word again,
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:37.340]   I had to exercise my mind again because I had forgotten.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.660]   So we have to go into each one of these.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.180]   True, that's the first one.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.460]   True.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.620]   That means pertaining to being real and not imaginary.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.780]   That sounds so simple.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.860]   Pertaining to being real and not imaginary.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.860]   There have been people I've counseled who are like, well, like how do I know God loves
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.480]   me?
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.740]   Because it says God loves you.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.060]   Right?
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.540]   It's just, there are certain things about faith.
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.140]   It's like, but how do I want God?
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.020]   But it's just like, well, do you want him?
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.380]   These things about faith, it's like, well, do you believe it?
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:18.060]   You know, faith is an amazing thing because it's that perfect intersection between just
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:22.500]   believing and then everything just becoming a reality as a result of that.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.500]   Right?
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.380]   Because there's a surrender to that thought.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:30.020]   So when we're saying that, when Paul is saying that we must dwell on true things, we have
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.020]   to ask ourselves what is true?
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.020]   What is real?
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.020]   What is not imaginary?
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.340]   There's a report done and it was, whatever.
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.340]   I don't care about the results.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.780]   You know, you can like make this the results of any survey, however you want.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:51.940]   But they were polling a bunch of people and saying, what are the things that you're worried
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.940]   about?
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.940]   Like you have deep anxiety over it.
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.100]   And they would write it in, turn it in.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:01.100]   And then they arbitrarily figured out like, oh, only 8% of those people had anxieties
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.900]   that were actually of concern.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.700]   The other 92% was not really a concern.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.260]   And that was an arbitrary thing.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.940]   But it's still an interesting thing because when we were to ask ourselves the question,
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.340]   the things that we're anxious about, how much of that pertains to what we believe to be
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.540]   truth and reality versus lies?
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.540]   Right?
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.540]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.540]   No?
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.540]   I got some blank eyes, so.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:31.660]   Because when we steep ourselves in the truths of God, like our very reality changes, doesn't
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.660]   it?
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.660]   Right?
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:40.860]   When we're looking at the things of God and we're thinking about the things of God, I'm
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.980]   not saying that we can come doctrinally to the correct conclusions.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.060]   But when we're steeping in it, something is different.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.500]   My home church where I grew up in, it was a lot more elderly people.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:57.380]   So I was at the hospital every month, and many, many deathbed visits.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.980]   And it was incredibly sobering to me.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.220]   One of the interesting things is, you know that thing where we say, if somebody is going
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.500]   through a difficult time, don't say, "Trust God."
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.060]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.740]   Because it might be kind of insensitive.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.740]   And that's true.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:10.740]   We have to be careful.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.740]   Right?
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.060]   But there's something about it where it's like, but that's the truth, though.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.180]   And so somewhere in the midst of that conversation or one day, like if that person refuses to
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.180]   trust God, we have to be able to say, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.740]   Do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.900]   In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will keep your path straight."
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.700]   Because that's the conclusion that we believe in.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.700]   That's the truth.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.700]   Right?
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.100]   But what was really sobering to me was when I'd go to these deathbeds of some of these
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.820]   individuals who have been walking with Christ for decades, I would go, and you know what
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.820]   happened?
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.700]   In a place where I would have to, I should be telling them, "Trust God."
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:47.940]   They were looking at me, young man, and said, "Trust God."
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:52.020]   These people have been steeping in this truth.
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.720]   It has become their reality.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.720]   This is their truth.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.800]   And they're not just saying it because it's a doctrine to them.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.820]   They're saying it because it is the truth.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.820]   It's real.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.620]   And they've been ruminating on it.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.940]   And like a teabag, they've been steeping in it over and over and over and over again.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:15.380]   So when you're a kid, it could be a cut finger that makes your whole life turn around.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.100]   Later on in life, it could be cancer.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.820]   But they've grown in this and steeping in the truth.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.980]   Think about the truth of God.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:27.380]   What would happen to us if we stopped believing in the lies of the enemy and the lies that
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.500]   the world is trying to say?
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.620]   What would happen to us?
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.160]   When the world says, "You must buy this thing."
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.700]   We know in here, "No, I don't.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.980]   Stop trying to trick me.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.860]   I don't need that."
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.460]   And then we keep clicking on it.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:49.060]   We're resolved for one month, but in three months, there's our car, sparkly, right in
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.780]   the front of our house.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.260]   We know, but what do we dwell on?
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.660]   We might know, and then we start dwelling on those things, and look at what happens.
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.820]   We know, and we must dwell on these things.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.040]   What's going to happen when you dwell on these truths?
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.060]   If God is for us, then who can be against us?
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.340]   How will that actually paint our reality?
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.780]   How will that change our hearts?
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.980]   How would it change our hearts if we believe in this truth for to us to live is Christ
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.760]   and to die is gain?
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.840]   If we were to ruminate in the truth, the world is passing away and all that is in it, unbelievers
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.220]   are today perishing.
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.980]   We're dwelling and steeping in that truth.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.700]   How will our hearts change?
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.020]   How will our wills and our motives and our intentions and our behavior and our thoughts
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.580]   and our affections, how would we change as people?
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.900]   Now, this is a sanctification.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:47.260]   What about what is honorable?
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.380]   What is honorable?
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:56.980]   See, we have this thought of like, "Hey, your feelings do not dictate the truth."
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.980]   The Word of God, the truth is the truth.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:03.180]   God tells you what is true.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:09.140]   We look at these things and we move into what is honorable, this idea of what is pertaining
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:15.500]   to appropriate or good or dignified or respectable things.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:20.760]   Now we go into a realm of truth that shows you actually what is good, things that are
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.140]   worthy of respect or of good character.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.820]   Some translations say noble things, elevated things.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.940]   I like the way Steve Lawson, a word he uses.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.500]   He says lofty things.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.060]   I love that word.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.780]   High things, majestic things.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.420]   So let's take a moment, look the other way.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.860]   He's saying not the trashy things of the world, not the mundane things, the temporal things
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.180]   of the world, not the trivial things.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.980]   He's saying do not dwell upon the things that are just kind of passing away.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:53.760]   He is saying look and dwell and think about the eternal things, the lofty things.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.060]   Because if we believe it in here and we're just kind of thinking about it, "Yeah, I agree
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:00.940]   with that," and we're doing the Christian head nod and we're not dwelling on it, what
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:06.380]   do we think is going to come about as a result?
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.900]   Every once in a while dipping into that water.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.220]   What is honorable?
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:16.260]   Think of what you're reading, partaking in when no one else is looking, what you watch
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.700]   on TikTok, articles you're clicking into, what images you linger on, what things that
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.040]   you fantasize about.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.500]   Are these things honorable things?
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.460]   See, he's not telling you what not to look at, he's telling you what to look at.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:35.300]   If we're coming and saying like, "Well, I'm allowed to," but what he's saying is, "Well,
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.940]   not like what I'm not allowed to do," he's saying like, "Look at the things that are
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.540]   good and dwell on those things."
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.100]   Because when you dwell on those things, these things fade.
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:51.580]   That's the point.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:56.140]   We're called not to let dishonorable things control our thoughts.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.100]   When we steep on the honorable, our hearts change, our reactions change, and it shows
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.900]   us the moments of reaction where we've been steeping.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.580]   Now, those moments of reactions are many.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.940]   One of them, I think it's familiar with a lot of us, like the freeway, you go on the
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:13.460]   freeway and then like as soon as someone cuts you off, it shows you how you've been walking
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.460]   with the Lord.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.020]   I'm very convinced of this.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:23.940]   Not when you're with your family or with somebody else in the car, but when you're by yourself.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.700]   That when you're ruminating and mulling and steeping on the things that are lofty and
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:34.260]   honorable and good, respectable, noble, just these things that are of God, someone cuts
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.500]   off, what's going to come out?
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.420]   That shows you where your heart has been steeping.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:44.740]   Do not let yourself be fooled into thinking that you can believe yourself to be a double-minded
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.700]   person, that with a group of people, you can say all these lofty things about God, and
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.500]   then in these situations, in these places of the hidden heart, there aren't honorable
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   things going on.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   That's not right, and you cannot give that kind of heart to God.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.400]   He will not accept it.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.940]   What is right, the ESV says what is just, the things that are right, that which are
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:14.400]   morally right, the holy things that conform to God's commands.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.540]   So often I think we are righteous upholders of God's law.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:23.020]   Hey, God doesn't need us to like defend who he is.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:28.740]   We are just called to show people who God is by our lives and through the word.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.380]   He does not need defending.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:38.420]   On right things, to think upon right things, we must not laugh along with jokes against
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:44.140]   God, to root along with storylines of immorality, to partake in the things, to dwell upon the
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:48.420]   things and say like, "It's my Christian liberty."
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.460]   Because here he's saying dwell.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:56.700]   It's a present continuous, continuously every day, steeping, ruminating, mulling on the
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.700]   right things of God.
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:03.100]   Just a word.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.180]   My kids, I'm going to stop using names because I realize I should stop using my kids' names.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.100]   There's three of them so you could guess.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:16.060]   There's one kid who comes and this person comes and tattles and says, "Oh, this other
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.340]   person in my home has done this."
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.340]   Right?
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:26.620]   And then they're, "You know, I see this and as this individual," this is kind of hard,
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.020]   "I have two girls, so I'll just say she."
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.060]   Oh, okay, well, that's that.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.500]   All right.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.500]   Okay.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.380]   So when she's like, "Oh, this person did this."
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.860]   Like, it's actually a good thing that she told me this because that thing was like dangerous
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:44.300]   or wrong or something like that, right?
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.820]   So I would have to like go and address this.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.620]   But the problem is this, and if you're a parent, you might be familiar with this.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.460]   When this person comes like, "This person did this."
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.460]   You know, right?
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:58.140]   It's like the attitude in which she comes is like, it's really like bad.
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.580]   So ugly.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.460]   There are times when like when they act like that, like I actually audibly just want to
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:08.420]   go like, "Ugh."
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:14.260]   She's saying the right things, she did the right thing to tell me, but she's like, "He
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.260]   did this."
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.260]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.260]   Okay.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:25.580]   So Addy tattles on Hudson a lot.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.300]   It's like every day right now.
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.300]   Okay.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.300]   Oh, well.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.300]   All right.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:34.180]   But you see what I'm saying, right?
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:38.780]   When we're dwelling on right things, it's like we can like just say the right things,
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:43.620]   we can do the right things and all this kind of stuff, but that's not actually a person
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.500]   who has been steeping their heart in right things.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.420]   It looks so different.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:55.760]   The love, the kindness, the grace, and even the rebuke and the exhortations and the wrath
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.760]   looks very different.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:02.300]   Oh, man, if you're a parent and you've ever had to discipline your child, you can say
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.300]   the right things.
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.980]   You can say, "This is who God is."
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:09.820]   And if you use that to punitively take out your anger upon the person, that is expressly
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.820]   wrong.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.900]   The heart, the medium is everything.
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:22.620]   So that when the truth comes out, that's good.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.060]   What about the pure things?
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:28.220]   Pertaining to being without moral defect or blemish and pure.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.660]   Purity of thought, purity of purpose, sexual purity.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.780]   There is no disjointedness in a person, it's integrity.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:41.980]   It's someone who's virtuous and wholesome, somebody who's without impurity, unmixed with
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.260]   filth.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.540]   And so we can't think like we have to try to get a little better at this.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:51.580]   The standard that's being talked about here is God's standard of purity, to dwell upon
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.700]   absolute purity, not just getting better.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.220]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.620]   It's not that we're trying to make ourselves pure.
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:05.820]   I'm saying dwell upon the pure things of God.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:12.060]   Other ways, stop looking at the garbage, the trashy things of the world.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.380]   What about the lovely things?
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:18.700]   To dwell upon the lovely things is pertaining to that which causes people to be pleased
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.700]   with something.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.700]   It is something that inspires love.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.220]   There's an attractiveness to us, again, because there is no disjointedness.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.820]   There is no hypocrisy in this.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:29.620]   There's a person who says something and lives it out.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:33.180]   There's nothing more ugly than somebody who says all these things but lives in a different
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.180]   way, right?
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.540]   It's just so unattractive when you see something like that.
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:43.320]   But somebody who, like for believers, we must be people who are lovely because not only
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.940]   are we saying all the right things but our conduct and our behavior and our way of life
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.380]   looks just like the rest of the world.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.300]   Is that what's gonna be lovely in the eyes of the people?
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.300]   No.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:55.940]   In the eyes of the people that we must look lovely because not only are we saying that
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:59.420]   the things of the world are passing away, we are now partaking in those things because
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.420]   we believe it.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.340]   And so our lives become lovely.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.620]   It inspires awe of love in people and wonder.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:07.620]   Okay.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:11.340]   Well, there's three more.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:16.180]   Good repute, things that are excellent and praiseworthy, and I'll let you do the work.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:22.300]   Now, there are plenty of us who can talk about each of the items on this list.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.700]   But the Christian is not just someone who's able to occasionally pull this out and let's
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.300]   talk about it, right?
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.300]   Like pure things.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.260]   Can we have Christian like talk about it?
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:32.260]   We can even debate it.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:40.020]   We can even try to persuade ourselves of the truth of God's Word.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:43.940]   But the Christian is not somebody who's able to just talk about the things of God.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.260]   Their lives talk about it almost.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.260]   It's almost kind of like that.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.300]   The lives talk about it.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.600]   Our lives become a testing to the things that are being said.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.660]   We have to say them, but our lives do not give us away.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.660]   It supports it.
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:11.420]   We steep, we meditate, we dwell on lofty, godly, beautiful things.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:16.300]   And so we ourselves are becoming godly and beautiful.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:20.240]   We must dwell on these things and allow the Word of God to richly dwell in us.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.100]   If we're not dwelling in these truths, you know what's happening?
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.100]   We're just steeping in the Word of God for one second every morning.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.100]   We're wondering, "Why isn't it changing me?"
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.020]   We just come in.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.580]   It's not going to change you.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:40.300]   If we're not dwelling in the Word of God, then we're not allowing the Word of God even
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:44.820]   a chance to look into us and examine our hearts.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.180]   This is the difference between someone who is walking with God and someone who has facts
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.220]   about God swirling around the brain.
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.620]   This is the difference between someone who is academic and scholarly concerning the things
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.460]   of the world and then somebody who is abiding in Him and thinking about and knowing about
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.200]   God on an intimate level.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.840]   And I believe that this is the problem with many Christians and churches today of which
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.380]   we ourselves, by the way, are not innocent.
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.660]   Especially as individuals, we are not innocent to these things.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:14.060]   And it's been grieving in recent years, not because of what the world has looked like.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.860]   Can you guys agree with me on this one?
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:18.500]   That we're not grieving that just the world looks like this.
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.740]   The Bible has already told us what the world is and where the world is headed and what
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.740]   it's going to be like.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:30.900]   And we see the sin in us.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.820]   I think that's what's been happening in our society nowadays without getting too deep
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.300]   into this.
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:42.020]   Wondering if this is why the words that are being used, the things that are being said
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:49.020]   sound so similar to the unbelieving and secular world and how they would respond and speak
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.740]   into those same things.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:56.340]   And of course, there's the, "But for God's glory and to the glory of Christ are added
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.820]   in there at the end."
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:02.260]   But just like somebody who would come up and say all the right things but has not been
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:13.220]   steeping in it, I wonder if perhaps that's why we look so much like the world.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:18.260]   I believe that even Christians have been dwelling, meditating, steeping and saturating in social
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:25.380]   media and stories and articles and friends and things that are ultimately man-centered
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.780]   and not God-centered.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:30.940]   And so the results, though if you thought about those things in an appropriate way,
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:32.700]   the results would be godly.
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.700]   The results come out looking the way we see it today.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.420]   And it's a spectrum.
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:41.900]   I'm not saying here's the line and we place everyone here or we place everyone here.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.140]   That's just not good to do.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:52.620]   These taglines of reparation and reconciliation, representation and repentance.
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.460]   All of these things in themselves, not wrong.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:59.140]   Maybe some things that must be and should be considered, though I think that today has
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:05.860]   hijacked it, but it reveals and exposes what we've been dwelling upon, the things central
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.780]   to God or not.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.940]   I believe that many of us have been dwelling on these things.
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:17.660]   Now, I'll take it to a third and last point, we must practice what we must dwell on.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.620]   Verse 9, he continues by saying, "The things you have learned and received and heard and
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.500]   seen in me," he says, "practice these things."
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.740]   This means to do or to carry out or to perform.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.940]   This means that the things that he calls us to think about, now you must go and do because
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.100]   these things, again, are not separated things.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.860]   These are interrelated things.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.740]   That when we say we believe something, if our actions do not follow, then we do not
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.140]   really believe those things.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:47.140]   That this is because when we give our hearts, we give him everything about who we are.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:50.020]   Our hearts is not something we rip out of our chest and say, "Here's my body, here's
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.700]   my flesh, and here you go."
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.860]   It's saying that I give you all that I am and so the practicing follows.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:00.260]   And so he says, "All that you've learned and received and heard and seen, practice.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.820]   Do it over and over and over again."
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:06.820]   So dwell on these things over and over and over again.
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.740]   Dwell on the things that are of God.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:11.780]   Dwell on the good and lofty and beautiful things.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:16.660]   Dwell on the way in which that it would reveal to your own heart how you are, what you're
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:20.420]   like, how much you're in need of repentance, what God has done for you so that when you
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:23.660]   go out into the world, you become a steeped person.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.460]   You become someone who has been changed.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:29.540]   You are someone who is not just espousing a bunch of things and you're angry all the
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.540]   time and you're frustrated all the time.
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:36.580]   I was so frustrated last week and I know I was so frustrated because I saw what I was
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.580]   ruminating upon.
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:42.940]   I was on Twitter a little bit too much last week.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.940]   But I had to catch myself and come back and I was so thankful for this passage.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.820]   It reminded me, remember God.
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:53.100]   Remember the state of the world before God.
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.060]   Remember who he is.
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:58:01.460]   And then from there, out of the proper thinking, he says, "Practice."
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:06.100]   I think this is where a lot of talking needs to happen between us.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.820]   How are we going to do this?
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.940]   And he concludes at the end, he says, "And the God of peace will be with you."
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.540]   And I love that because he tags it at the end.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:19.380]   He did that, by the way, a few verses earlier.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.740]   "And the peace of Christ will be with you."
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:27.220]   Don't we many times come before God in prayer asking for peace?
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.540]   Because our hearts are in such turmoil?
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.740]   Honestly what we're saying is we're emotionally in disturbance, right?
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:35.580]   We're saying, "Change that."
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.460]   And yet we're refusing to stop reading articles.
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:39.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.780]   Like, I'm not saying it's wrong to read the articles.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:43.860]   Like, just dwelling and thinking about these over and over again.
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:45.220]   You're wondering, "God, help me.
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.620]   Help me to be more humble.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.060]   Help me to be more like this.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.940]   Help me to be more like you."
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:51.820]   And then we're just constantly looking at these things.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.900]   "God, please help me to do these things and watch some more TV.
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:55.900]   Please help me to do these things."
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:00.500]   And if we're to sit back and stop and look at the whole of our lives and ask ourselves,
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.460]   what have we been steeping on?
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:03.460]   Where is our mind?
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:07.780]   Please, today, would you take some time to consider where your minds have been?
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:16.140]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, his last thing, long quote, he says, "Faith, according to our Lord's
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:19.740]   teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, is primarily thinking.
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.820]   The whole trouble with a man of little faith is that he does not think.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.020]   He allows circumstances to bludgeon him.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.940]   That is the real difficulty in life.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.780]   Life comes to us with a club in its hand and strikes us upon the head, and we become incapable
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.920]   of thought, helpless and defeated.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.560]   The way to avoid that, according to our Lord, is to think.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.660]   We must spend more time in studying our Lord's lessons in observation and deduction.
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:45.220]   The Bible is full of logic, and we must never think of faith as something purely mystical.
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:49.080]   We do not just sit down in an armchair and expect marvelous things to happen to us.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.260]   That is not Christian faith.
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.020]   Christian faith is essentially thinking.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.620]   Look at the birds.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:55.620]   Think about them.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:56.620]   Draw your deductions.
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:57.620]   Look at the grass.
[00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.700]   Look at the lilies of the field and consider them.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:03.060]   The trouble with most people, however, is that they will not think.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.020]   Instead of doing this, they sit down and ask, "What is going to happen to me?
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.380]   What can I do?"
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.060]   That is the absence of thought.
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:10.100]   It is surrender.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.220]   It is defeat.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.940]   Our Lord here is urging us to think and to think in a Christian manner.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.660]   That is the very essence of faith.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.340]   Faith, if you like, can be defined like this.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:23.380]   It is a man insisting upon thinking when everything seems determined to bludgeon and knock him
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.280]   down in an intellectual sense.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.820]   The trouble with the person of little faith is that instead of controlling his own thought,
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.660]   his thought is being controlled by something else.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.360]   As we put it, he goes round and round in circles.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.820]   That is the essence of worry.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:36.900]   That is not thought.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.700]   That is the absence of thought, a failure to think.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:45.180]   I want to conclude by, because it's Father's Day, just the last point of application.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:50.380]   Fathers, this is the most important thing for us as fathers in this room, to be people
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.060]   who dwell on the good things of God.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.580]   Take time to really think about what you've been dwelling on.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:01.020]   It could be the obviously distracting things, but it could also be the things that you're
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:05.900]   trying to give which are kind of good to the children.
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:10.340]   Just like how when we steep our hearts, it's going to shape us and change us, as fathers,
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:14.460]   as husbands, it is going to shape and change our families as well.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.980]   It's going to happen.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.220]   As we go, our families go.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.820]   As we go, our wives will go.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.480]   They are called to submit to us.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.460]   As we go, the children are called to obey us.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.120]   If you have not been dwelling on the things of God, it is expressly important for us,
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.100]   every father in this room, to say, "Today, as for me and my household, we will serve
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.100]   the Lord."
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.100]   Let's pray.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.980]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your truths, and we pray, God, for more of your spirit
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:48.020]   to come and help us, that your spirit might richly allow the word of God to dwell within
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:53.060]   us, but God, that it would not be simply mystical, but that we would be doing the work of coming
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:57.740]   before you, of giving to you all our thoughts and everything we've been meditating and looking
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:02.060]   and thinking and dwelling upon, and God, to surrender to you and say, "God, all this is
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.060]   yours."
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.060]   Would you take our entire hearts today?
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.060]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:05.060]   Amen.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:05.960]   Amen.
