[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   If you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 5, we'll read verse 11 through 14.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.520]   Hebrews chapter 5, verse 11 through 14.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.960]   Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain since you have become dull
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.240]   of hearing.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.880]   For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.720]   the elementary principles of the oracles of God.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.660]   And you have come to need milk and not solid food.
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.520]   For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.360]   for he is an infant.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.800]   But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   good and evil.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.960]   Let's pray.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.760]   Gracious Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to come and worship you.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.040]   Help us Lord to never take for granted the grace that causes us to stand.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.440]   Help us Lord God to be reminded again of who you are.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.760]   In light of that, we pray that you would take the warning that is put in this passage Lord
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.760]   and help us to be sober.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.440]   Help us Lord God to respond in an appropriate way.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.360]   And we pray that our ears truly may be open to you and you alone.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.640]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.200]   If you can put up the signs.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.720]   Okay, there you go.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.280]   So most of you, if not all of you, have driver's license and you had to have taken this test.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.320]   So if you fail this test, you shouldn't have a license.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.280]   So these are road signs that kind of prepare us for what is coming.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.180]   So what is that sign?
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.600]   If you see this sign coming, what does this mean?
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.360]   The roads are curvy so if you see that, what does that mean that you ought to be doing?
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.840]   Speed up?
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840]   Tokyo drift?
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   Right?
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.720]   Opportunity for you to test your skills?
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.640]   It means slow down, right?
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.240]   If you go at the same speed, you might get into trouble, okay?
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.800]   How about the next one?
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.360]   Pedestrian, like unless you're playing a video game, this is a sign for you to slow down.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.640]   These are all warning signs to kind of be extra cautious because there's human beings
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.000]   crossing the road, right?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.800]   So what does this mean?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.000]   Merging lane, right?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.720]   So if you're going side by side, you're going to speed, the two lanes are going to become
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.840]   one, so somebody has to slow down, you have to be cautious.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.480]   So all of these signs are kind of warning signs about what's coming ahead and if you're
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.080]   not careful, if you're going at the same way, you can't drive the same way or else you're
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   going to get into trouble.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.640]   What's the next one?
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   Railroad crossing, okay?
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.200]   So another sign.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.120]   All of these signs are here because while you're driving, it means to slow down, stop,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.880]   to take a look, that there is, you know, some of these signs are more dangerous than others,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.840]   some of these require more attention than others, but every one of these signs are there
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.560]   to help us to drive safely.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.760]   What's the next one?
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.080]   So dead end.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.680]   So if you see this sign, basically you're headed the wrong direction, unless that's
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.760]   where you're headed.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.360]   So if you keep going down this direction, there is no through street.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.880]   So it typically means you need to turn around, right?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.680]   You're headed the wrong direction.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.840]   Now the reason why you need to know these signs is because as you are driving, these
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.560]   things are there so that you can be a safe driver and you don't hurt other people, right?
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.840]   And again, I'm assuming these are basic signs.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.080]   There's some other signs, you know, sometimes in the countryside that you may not recognize,
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.900]   but these are all pretty basic signs, right?
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.360]   And if you are driving, which almost everybody here is, you should have known what these
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.280]   signs are for, because it helps us to be better drivers.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.640]   Now I gave all of that to you because the book of Hebrews is filled with warning signs,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   right?
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.640]   If I asked you, "What is the purpose of the book of Hebrews?"
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.160]   You'd say, "Well, it's Christology, right?
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.360]   It's 11 chapters of exposition of the supremacy of Christ over all things.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.360]   He's better than the angels.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   He's better than Moses.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   He's better than the sacrificial system."
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.760]   But all of that, he's giving for a purpose.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.240]   This shouldn't have been new to the readers of Hebrews.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.240]   This is not new.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   He's reminding them.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.840]   And the reason why he's reminding them is because the recipients of this letter was
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.120]   beginning to drift.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.920]   And so in the midst of Christology, he breaks in with serious warnings.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.400]   There's five specific warnings.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.280]   There's one in chapter two, one in chapter three, the one that we're looking at here,
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.600]   and then in the beginning of chapter six, there's a very serious warning, probably the
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.480]   most serious warning, harshest warning toward the church in Hebrews chapter 10.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480]   Let me read that for you.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.720]   Hebrews chapter 10, 26 to 31, it says, "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.160]   the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins."
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.120]   Now, when he says that, he's not saying that if you willfully sin that you can't repent
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.480]   and God will not forgive you.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.220]   What he is saying is, you know the path of righteousness, you know the path of forgiveness,
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.900]   but you choose to go the other path.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.080]   You continue to willfully sin and you reject the gospel by your actions.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.560]   He says, "There is no other repentance for sins."
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.040]   In other words, Christ is the only way.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.760]   "But as a terrifying expectation of judgment that the fury of a fire which will consume
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   the adversaries.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.800]   Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.580]   or three witnesses.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.440]   How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.000]   son of God and has regarded as the unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.020]   sanctified and has insulted the spirit of grace?
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.360]   For we know him who said, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repent.'
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.420]   Again, the Lord will judge his people.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.700]   It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.920]   You probably know the sermon, "Sinners in the Hand of an Angry God," by Jonathan Edwards,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.260]   one of the harshest and most direct sermons ever given, or at least that we know of.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.700]   It's based upon this passage.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.940]   And a lot of people who read the Bible superficially will read and say, "You know what?
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.500]   The God of the Old Testament seems to be harsh.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.900]   He brings the flood, brings judgment.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.140]   But in the New Testament, he's like a gracious grandfather.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.960]   You just do whatever you want and he gives you candy."
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   Absolutely untrue.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.460]   If you read the Bible carefully, you will find, just as he says in Hebrews chapter 10,
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.260]   if God hated sin in the Old Testament, how much severe, he says, will the judgment be
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.740]   after grace has been given through the blood of Jesus Christ, and you completely reject
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.900]   him, and you trample on the foot, and you treat as unclean the blood of the covenant,
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.980]   Jesus Christ, how much more severe would God's anger burn?
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.500]   It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   This is not Old Testament.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   I'm not reading Ezekiel.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.740]   I'm not reading Daniel.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.360]   I'm reading in the book of Hebrews.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.860]   And he is writing to the church.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.980]   He's not writing to outside the church.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.400]   In fact, there is a debate among the commentators about, is this addressing, is the book of
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.020]   Hebrews in the warnings, is this addressing non-Christians or Christians?
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.700]   Some will argue that clearly it must be Christians because he's writing to the church.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.180]   And they say, "Well, clearly this can't be a description of a Christian."
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.100]   So he's addressing non-Christians.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:36.100]   I don't think that debate is fruitful because I don't think the author of Hebrews had in
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.420]   mind that the words that he is saying is only for non-Christians and only for Christians.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.220]   He's writing to the church.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.500]   And within the church, there are tares and there are wheats, meaning that there are some
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.980]   people who are claiming to be Christians who are just going through the motion, and in
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.580]   time you will recognize that maybe they really didn't have faith.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:03.060]   And then there are some people within the church who may be drifting, genuine believers
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:09.340]   but kind of distracted and the concerns and life of the world is choking out their faith.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:17.360]   And so these warnings are given so that a Christian may hear it and may take heed.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.860]   They see the warning signs on the street and say, "Hey, I'm headed the wrong direction.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.220]   There's things that I need to pay attention to, that I've been drifting and this is not
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.980]   the right path for me to be on."
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:34.460]   And so, as he says in the previous chapter, "Let us fear that we do not fall short of
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.100]   the rest of Christ and let us be diligent and let us hold fast and let us draw near."
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.980]   So a Christian will hear these warnings and correct whatever behavior, whatever thing
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.020]   is going on so that we may get right with God.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:52.260]   And then for the unbelievers in the church, we'll be waking up from whatever delusion
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.260]   that they may be in, thinking that because I was raised in the church, that because I'm
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.660]   a member, because I do these things and I know some of these doctrines, that I am safe.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.260]   And so it is written to the Christian and the non-Christian so that in order for the
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.100]   church to be sober and make sure that our faith is genuine.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.700]   So it's important for us, so the author, before he moves on, to go into the depth of teaching
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.820]   about Melchizedek, which he's going to do in chapter 7.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.580]   Before he gets in there, he says, "I can't even talk to you about Melchizedek because
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.180]   you have become, one, become dull of hearing."
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.980]   And these are some of the things that he describes of somebody who is either on the way of drifting
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:41.320]   or maybe a non-Christian who doesn't have any appetite for the things of God.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.660]   These are the four characteristics that he mentions in this text.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.140]   One, he says, "He has become dull of hearing."
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:53.820]   In Hebrews chapter 5, 11, concerning him, we have much to say, meaning about Melchizedek.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.100]   Melchizedek is a very important figure in Scripture.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.220]   He's only mentioned briefly in the Old Testament, but he says all of who Melchizedek represents
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:07.100]   was the office of Christ that God was preparing so that when Christ came and became the king
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.540]   priest that people said, "Wow, that's what that was."
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.580]   But before the author gets into that in chapter 7, he says, "I can't even get into that because
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.580]   you have become dull of hearing."
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.440]   When it says they have become dull of hearing, it means that at some point they were not.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.740]   They got into this place.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.100]   It wasn't that they were always like that.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:34.380]   In fact, in Hebrews 10, 32, 34, it describes how they were when they first met Christ.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.100]   But remember the former days when after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:45.180]   of sufferings, partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations,
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.460]   and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.420]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.340]   knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.780]   So this is a description of this church.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:05.500]   So at one point, they were participating in the persecution.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.820]   Their possessions were being taken, they were visiting their friends in prison.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:16.500]   And so it's describing a church that at least on the surface was on fire at one point.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.240]   And he says, "For whatever the reason, maybe it was fatigue.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.540]   Maybe the persecution got to them.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.460]   Maybe it was just the longevity of the hardship of life.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.620]   Maybe it was beginning to sink in.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.060]   That when Jesus said to pick up your cross, that he meant it."
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.540]   A lot of times, you know, when we talk about Jesus was picking up the cross, we just take
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.340]   it metaphorically, right?
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.140]   But maybe it began to sink in that, "Oh, shoot, he really meant that."
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.780]   When he said, "If you want to come after me, pick up your cross and deny yourself."
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.380]   And maybe that really began to sink in like, "Oh, that is required."
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.100]   For whatever the reason, they were beginning to drift.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.100]   And as they were beginning to drift, he says, "You have become hard of hearing."
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.480]   And it wasn't a mistake.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.860]   It wasn't an accident.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:08.260]   He says, "Something that they were doing caused them to not tolerate sound teaching."
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:16.540]   In Matthew 13, 14 to 16, a similar prophecy is given to the nation of Israel through Isaiah.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.260]   And it's quoting Isaiah, and it says, "In their case, the prophecy of Isaiah is being
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.620]   fulfilled which says, 'You will keep on hearing, but will not understand.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.260]   You will keep on seeing, but will not perceive.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.580]   For the heart of this people has become dull.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.060]   With their ears they scarcely hear, and they have closed their eyes.
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.580]   Otherwise they would see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.700]   heart and return, and I would heal them.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.460]   But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.'"
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.980]   He said the nation of Israel, before they went into captivity, had the same problem.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:55.260]   He said God was sending prophets, prophet after prophet, warning them, giving warning
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:00.500]   signs that if you keep going down this path, it's a dead end.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.500]   But they would not listen.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.540]   He said they kept on hearing, but they would not understand.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:15.980]   And the reason why they became dull of hearing is because they just were not interested.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.540]   You know, every pastor, every Sunday, they give sermons, and one of the things that we
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:26.780]   are taught and that we learn is whenever we give an important lesson in the church, we
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.060]   have to connect it to something relevant to you.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.320]   And so I try.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:37.580]   I try to talk about movies that I think that you've seen, and sometimes it's outdated.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:43.220]   And I try to talk about, you know, like Lakers, because I know there's a lot of Lakers fans.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.880]   And I try to do something like, oh, parents are raising children, because that's something
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.180]   that we can all relate to.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.900]   And I think it's helpful when we do that, because it helps me to listen to sermons as
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.500]   well.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.500]   But the problem is when someone is dull of hearing, that's all they're interested in.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:09.100]   And as soon as we move beyond these illustrations, there's no interest.
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:14.900]   It's kind of like listening to instructions about building something, and you have no
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.020]   intentions to build it.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:22.180]   Nobody goes and looks up the building code, right, and how to build this, how to build
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:27.660]   that, if you're not in the process of building something, right, because it's just not interesting.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.980]   And so part of the reason why people become dull of hearing is because it just becomes
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.900]   information.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.580]   If there is no affection for Christ in your heart, the gospel is just information.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.100]   It's something that happened in history.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.620]   You may not reject it, you may not hate it, but it has no impact in your life.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.260]   So after a while, you heard Jesus died for you, he loved you, and then last year we talked
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.180]   about how Jesus cried out in tears.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.700]   He learned obedience through his suffering.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.980]   It sounds just like a history lesson.
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.340]   Oh, that's what happened.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:09.060]   Oh, Lincoln was born here, and Washington did this, and Abraham Lincoln did this, and
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.740]   so you're learning history.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.660]   But it's not personal.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.580]   So after a while, we become dull of hearing because it is not practical.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.500]   There's nothing practical for you.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.980]   So you start hearing, "Well, teach me how to raise my children.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.820]   Teach me how to be a good mother, how to be a good father."
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:32.860]   But whenever we start to endeavor in the depths of the things of Christ, we become dull of
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.140]   hearing.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:44.820]   And so Paul says, or the author says, the first sign that there is danger in our life
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.900]   is that we become dull of hearing.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.180]   These things that really ought to be, maybe at one point, softened your heart and caused
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.060]   you to repent and sing songs with all your heart, now it's just kind of like, "Okay,
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.540]   you know, okay, I heard it.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.540]   I know that.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.120]   I already know that."
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.860]   The Scripture says that there's going to come a time when people are not going to put up
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.220]   with sound doctrine, meaning that they're not going to have ears to hear sound doctrine.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.460]   Instead, they're going to gather around themselves teachers who are going to tickle their ears.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:18.780]   It's going to cause them to feel encouraged and enlightened and unburdened their busy
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.800]   life as it is.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.580]   And they're going to gather around teachers who are going to tickle their ears.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.420]   And he says to Timothy, "You do not sway.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.660]   Preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.460]   Whether they listen and don't listen, that is not your responsibility.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.580]   You continue to teach.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.500]   Whether they become dull of hearing or not, your responsibility is not to make sure that
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.900]   everybody wants to listen.
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.860]   Your responsibility is to preach the word in season and out of season.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:51.500]   But the first mark of somebody who is heading toward danger is that he becomes dull of hearing.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.820]   Secondly, he says, "They should have become teachers by now."
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:03.060]   In Hebrews 5.12, "For though by this time you ought to be teachers."
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.820]   It's not because of lack of teaching.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.140]   It's not because they haven't been exposed to proper teaching.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.300]   He says, "You've been given plenty of teaching.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.980]   You've been given plenty of opportunities.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.940]   But yet because you become dull of hearing, you never mature."
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:23.100]   In 2 Timothy 3.7, "They are always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.860]   truth."
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.260]   It wasn't lack of training.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.980]   It wasn't lack of information.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:34.020]   In fact, our generation has exposure to the truth more than any other generation that
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.660]   has ever lived.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.740]   Ever.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.260]   And I'm not just talking about, you know, this place.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.100]   Our generation, anybody who is born now into Christianity, because of internet, because
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:51.220]   of the Bible translation, because of the freedom that we have to travel, we have more access
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:56.860]   to the Word of God than any other generation ever in history.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.460]   And yet, this is probably true of our generation.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:06.660]   Always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of truth.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.900]   Hebrews 6, 7, and 8, which we'll be in next week, he goes even further and he says, "For
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.820]   the ground that drinks the rain, which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.780]   to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God."
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.140]   In other words, those people who receive God's Word.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.100]   And as a result, they're being fed and they're growing and bearing fruit.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.060]   "But," in verse 8 it says, "if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.380]   being cursed and it ends up being burned."
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.900]   So it has the same ground.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.380]   The Word of God is going forth, but some are bearing fruit, but the others receive the
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:47.380]   same rain and all it produces is thorns and thistles.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.420]   That's a description of what Jesus said, the four different soils.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.580]   You have the first soil where the seed falls and the devil comes and snatches away its
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.580]   unbeliever.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.140]   Now, we never worry about that because the unbelievers, they hear the Word of God and
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.140]   they say, "I don't believe that."
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.440]   They're not in the church.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.780]   If they're outright rejecting the gospel, they're not here because the devil took it,
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.140]   they're against us.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:15.140]   The second group is a seed that falls onto the rocky soil that there's a public confession,
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.860]   immediate confession.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.000]   But because there's no foundation, they also eventually leave.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.780]   So these are people who make the confession, they go to a crusade somewhere, they raise
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.340]   their hand, come down the aisle, they come to church and maybe even become members of
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.660]   the church, but it doesn't last long because their faith was maybe social.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.680]   Maybe they caved under pressure.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.720]   Maybe it was an emotional response, but not real faith.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.180]   So because of that, they also leave.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.380]   So they're not in the midst of us.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.800]   They usually end up just packing up and leaving.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.420]   It's the third soil and the fourth soil that we usually have the struggle with.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.580]   Third soil is the one that falls on the ground.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.700]   It actually bears fruit and it looks very similar to the fourth soil.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:06.580]   In fact, you know, in the book of Matthew, I believe in chapter 13, Jesus talks about
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.820]   the wheat and the tares.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.900]   He doesn't separate the wheat and the tares early on because the wheat and the tare, if
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.740]   you look at the pictures of a wheat and a tare, it looks exactly the same when it's
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.460]   young.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:25.700]   Until it grows and it bears fruit, the wheat actually, because of the wheat that is inside
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.620]   of it, eventually the weight of it begins to cause it to bend.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:35.260]   The tares, because it doesn't have wheat, it actually just continues to grow up.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.660]   So if you try to distinguish early on, you're going to end up tearing out the wheat with
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.140]   the tares.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.920]   But after a while, you see the fruit, then it is pretty obvious.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:53.380]   So the third soil is the one that in the beginning looks exactly the same.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.740]   It looks exactly the same.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.740]   They do the same thing.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.740]   They profess.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.740]   They seem passionate.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:03.500]   But after a while, they begin to drift and the same word that goes into them turns into
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.180]   bitterness and thorns and thistles.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.980]   And that's the field that it's talking about.
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.260]   They should have been teachers by now.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.020]   They received the same word.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:17.220]   They were in the same church and yet what was produced in them was thorns and thistles.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:23.620]   Forty Bachman gave a great sermon years ago at the Shepherds Conference.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.180]   And again, I'm going to butcher it, but one of the things that he powerfully illustrated
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:32.660]   was how if you went to law school for 10 years, you would assume that that person is an expert
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.700]   in the law.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.780]   If you were in med school for 10 years, you would assume that he would be an expert in
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.780]   medicine.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.460]   But it's not just in law and medicine.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.620]   If you just packed up chairs for 10 years, let's say for the next 10 years, your job
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.420]   was to pack up these chairs and put it away and put it back.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.100]   We would assume 10 years after that, you would be the expert.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.940]   So next time we pack up chairs, you're the guy we ask.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.100]   I mean, it's a simple task as putting chairs away, but you've been doing it every week
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.780]   for 10 years.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.300]   So what's the best way to put it away?
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.460]   What's the most efficient way to put it back?
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.820]   What's the best way to handle it?
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.740]   We would assume, everybody would assume that you would be the expert.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.980]   Whatever you have done for a long period of time, we just automatically assume that you
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.180]   would know better than anybody else.
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:25.340]   And so Voddie Bachman was saying, only in Christianity that you can have men and women
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.200]   who've been in church for decades.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.660]   And when they're asked about their faith, their answer is, "Well, talk to my pastor."
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.660]   I'm just a layman.
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.400]   I just attend church.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.660]   Only in Christianity has that become norm, where somebody who's been at church and professing
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.340]   Christian all their life, and you ask him about their faith, he's like, "Oh, I only
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.340]   know the ABCs."
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:55.940]   It is a strange, strange sight, strange, strange generation that we live in where we should
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:02.980]   be experts, where we should know our faith, and yet it's become common practice that you
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.260]   just refer them to the leaders, refer them to the elders, or refer them to the pastors.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.040]   And that's exactly what he's talking about.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.300]   He says, "Individuals who's drifting away from God, they become hard of hearing."
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:20.100]   He says, "By now, you should have been teachers, and yet you have to be taught again."
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.540]   Thirdly, they never go beyond the ABCs.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.700]   Hebrews chapter 5, 12.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.740]   You have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracle's
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.160]   God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.220]   You can sense some frustration in the author.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.100]   Because what the author wants to talk about is Melchizedek.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.220]   What the author wants to talk about is about the high priesthood of Christ and how he fulfills
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.620]   it and his prayers and what it means to us.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.620]   It'd be awesome.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:53.860]   It'd be awesome if every Sunday I would love to just talk about the love of Christ and
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.020]   the depth of the love of Christ and what it means for us, our adoption.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:04.940]   I would love every single Sunday just to dig deep into what Christ has done.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.940]   I could tell that the author of Hebrews is probably thinking the same thing.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.300]   I want to get to Melchizedek.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:15.440]   I want to talk about him, and I want to show you how God has been preparing for the coming
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:20.220]   of Christ, the king priesthood of Jesus.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:26.620]   But before I get to that, I can't jump into that because you guys aren't going to understand.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.940]   He's trying to get their attention.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.640]   It may be a little bit confusing, but I need you to work hard to understand.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   That's what he's doing.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.660]   He's going to send some frustration.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.780]   By this time, you ought to be teachers, but you need again to go over the ABCs.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:46.460]   The oracle that he's referring to is the Old Testament because he's talking to Jews who
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.920]   are just kind of drifting back to their old life.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:55.480]   And that's why he's saying, "If you have Jesus, you have everything."
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.980]   And yet they're going back and say, "Well, maybe if we did more of this, maybe if we
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:59.980]   did that."
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:05.020]   And that's why he's saying Jesus is superior to all of this.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.780]   He says in Romans chapter 3, "Much in every way to begin with, the Jews were entrusted
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.720]   with the oracles of God."
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:16.480]   And the oracles he's referring to is the foundation that points to Christ.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.200]   The whole purpose of the shadow is to prepare so that when the reality comes, they can say,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.980]   "Ah, that's what the shadow is for."
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:29.140]   But because they become dull of hearing, they never make the connection.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.700]   And they have to go back and say, "Well, this is the shadow.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.700]   It's over again."
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:38.060]   They have to get over again to the shadows, and they never move beyond to maturity because
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.980]   they have become dull of hearing.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:46.780]   In Isaiah 28, 9-13, which is really interesting because Israelites were in the very similar
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.820]   place where the authors of Hebrews were.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.500]   Very religious.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.020]   On the surface, they looked like they were doing great things, but God saw through all
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.500]   of that, and they knew their heart was not in the right place.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.460]   Isaiah 28, 9-13 says, "To whom will He teach knowledge?
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.660]   To whom will He explain the message?
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.620]   Those who are weaned from the milk, those who've taken the breast."
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.420]   In other words, those who've matured.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.860]   How is God going to talk to people?
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.860]   Who is He going to talk to?
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:22.980]   He said, "Those who have graduated from breast milk and are able to eat solid food, for it
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:29.580]   is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little,
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.580]   there a little."
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.580]   Let me stop right there.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.140]   What does He mean by that?
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:39.820]   I remember the first time reading that, it's like, "Wow, what is He saying?"
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.020]   Precept upon precept, line upon line, precept upon precept, and He's just repetition over
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.020]   and over again.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.020]   He does it again, verse 11, "For by people of strange lips and with foreign tongues,
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.860]   and Lord will speak to this people."
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:55.220]   In other words, because they have become dull of hearing and they're not paying attention,
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.820]   He's talking about the Gentiles, right?
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.100]   Since you're not paying attention, the Gentiles are going to become what?
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.100]   Your teachers, right?
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.860]   And that's what happens in the church.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:10.220]   The Gentiles come in, and now the Gentiles are reaching out to the Israelites.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.100]   That's what He's saying, because they've become dull of hearing.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.300]   To whom?
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.780]   He has said, "This is rest.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.860]   Give rest to the weary, and this is repose."
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.580]   What is He referring to?
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.580]   The gospel, right?
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.660]   He said, "To whom?"
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:29.260]   They're telling them about the gospel, that Christ is going to come and give them the
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.620]   Sabbath, but they're not listening.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.340]   To them, what does God's gospel sound like?
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:41.620]   It says, "Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, hear
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:46.660]   little, their little, that they may go and fall backward and be broken and
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:53.140]   snared and taken. Do you understand what he's saying? He says he's been trying to
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:58.600]   teach them about the gospel, about what is going to bring them rest, but to them
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.880]   because they become hard of hearing, God's instruction just sounds like
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.080]   precept upon precept upon precept upon precept, line upon line upon line upon
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:15.380]   line, here a little, there a little. In other words, they don't understand. You
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:20.020]   know you ever hear you know the the cartoon Snoopy whenever the adults talk
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:26.900]   you hear that wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah. That's basically, that's
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.860]   basically what this is. Right? Snoopy wasn't invented yet. So that's that's
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.180]   basically what he's saying to the Israelites who become dull of hearing
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.700]   wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah. That's what a sermon sounds like. That's
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.500]   what exposition of order of God sounds like to somebody who doesn't have ears
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:51.060]   to hear because they become dull of hearing. And so all they see is how long?
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:57.380]   You know, because I need to put in my time because all church and Christianity
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.060]   and worship is is superstition because if you've been raised in the church and
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:06.100]   if you don't go to church, God's not going to bless your family. God's not
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.920]   going to bless your business. Maybe what if your child gets sick because God
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:16.180]   tries to discipline you and so it's nothing more than superstition. And so
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:22.780]   the time that we spend in the church is just checkmark so that I can appease
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:28.460]   this God. And so everything that I need to do within that time frame is just
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:34.700]   wah wah wah wah wah wah wah. Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, precept
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.180]   upon precept, line upon line. And I could do this for the next 30 minutes and it
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.980]   wouldn't sound any different. He said that's what the Word of God sounds
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.960]   like to somebody whose heart has become hardened, who has drifted away and has
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:55.060]   become lukewarm. And only when I talk about Lakers, only when I talk about
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.660]   parenting, only when I talk about something that perks up your eyes or
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:04.380]   ears, you pay attention and all of a sudden you're back to wah wah wah wah wah.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:09.820]   That's basically what he's saying. Instead of moving on to maturity, we have to
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.000]   go back and and re-establish a foundation because until you have the
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.640]   foundation, you cannot move on to maturity. In other words, he wants to get
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:23.300]   to Melchizedek but he can't right now because some of them are not listening.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:29.380]   Basically, it's just an elaborate way of saying, "He who has ears, let him hear." I
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:36.980]   am very aware, if we want our church to become a mega church, one of the first
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.740]   things that I need to do is I need to shorten my sermon. Like that, I know. I've
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:45.820]   been told. I've been told. I've gotten emails, people have been frustrated.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.940]   There have been sermons where I just poured my heart out and a guy come up to
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.420]   me and frustrated kind of like, "Dude, you're so loud," and then they would walk
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.940]   out. I've gone through all of that in all these years that I've been
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.420]   preaching. I'm very aware like what people want and don't want.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:07.380]   Generally speaking, keep my sermon short, plenty of
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.020]   illustrations to kind of keep people interested. So if I can be
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.820]   winsome and keep people engaged and put a little bit laughter here,
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.180]   a little bit laughter there, and then kind of mix it in with the love of God
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:23.420]   in the gospel. Again, I'm not saying that all of that stuff is
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:30.420]   wrong, but if that's the reason why you come to church, it's not hungering and
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.460]   thirsting for righteousness. It's not mainly because you want to hear from God.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.100]   Not to fill in that time. It's kind of like going to traffic school, but might
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.820]   as well go to comedy traffic school if you're gonna have to put in your time. I
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.460]   don't know if you've ever been to traffic school. It's like torture, right?
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:51.260]   So if you're gonna have to do it to reduce your points and reduce your
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:56.100]   insurance, might as well do it as innocuous as possible, as you know what I
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.940]   mean, the least painful as possible. So get online, make sure it's funny, get it
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.220]   right. You're not taking this seriously. You just need to put in your time. And so
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:12.140]   people who don't have years to hear, that's how they see the church. It's
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:17.660]   something painful that I need to do, but make it as harmless and as easy as
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:23.300]   possible. The frustration, you can hear the tone of the frustration of the
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.660]   author, "I want to get to Melchizedek, but I can't do it with you because you
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.580]   become hard of hearing. You have enough teaching where you should have been
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.380]   teachers." So the problem wasn't the environment, it wasn't the teaching, it
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.220]   was what was going on in their heart. Number four, it says they need milk and
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:42.780]   not solid food because they do not practice what they know. And that's the
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:47.940]   problem. The reason why it was they become dull of hearing is because it's
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:53.460]   irrelevant to them. Oftentimes people come to God and say, "God, show me
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:59.140]   your will." They haven't surrendered their heart yet. They haven't
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.660]   surrendered and said, "Lord, show me your will so that I may surrender." They haven't
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.460]   done that yet. Just in case, "Lord, show me your will, and then once you show it to
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:13.140]   me, I'll decide if I want to do it or not." And that's exactly what the scripture
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.500]   means, that do not test the Lord. And oftentimes the way that we pray is that,
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.700]   "God, show me your will. I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna do it, but show me your
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:27.300]   will." God never reveals himself to people who are coming to test him. That he who
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.020]   comes to God must first believe that he is, and he is a rewarder of those who
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.580]   diligently seek him. He who first comes to God, it is impossible to plea him
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:41.740]   without faith. He who comes to God must first believe that he is, and he is a
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.100]   rewarder of those who diligently seek him. But if we haven't committed our life
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:51.420]   to Christ, and we're just testing to see, "Lord, reveal yourself so that I may, maybe
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:59.740]   not, depending on what I want." Oftentimes, you know, we have a tendency, if we're not
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.340]   careful, to approach our Christianity like a smorgasbord. You guys know what a
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:08.020]   smorgasbord is? Okay. Now we have buffets and then non-buffets, but you know, years
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.780]   back, a smorgasbord, basically you walk into a cafeteria and you get what you
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.180]   want, and then you pay for whatever you grab, right? That's kind of what a
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.940]   smorgasbord is. I might be wrong. You can correct me afterwards, but that's what I
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.980]   understand what smorgasbord is, right? So you just get in a line, and then you want
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.060]   this, I don't want this, and you just kind of put whatever you're planning to eat,
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:32.220]   and then you pay for whatever you want. And everything that you don't want, you
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:37.860]   just leave behind, right? Our approach, oftentimes, sometimes, if we're not
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:44.100]   careful, is we come to Christ and we just kind of pick and choose. I like this, I
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.540]   don't like this, I like this, but I don't like that. And even the way that we
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:53.260]   listen to sermons, even the way that we study the Scriptures, even the way that
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:58.940]   we practice our faith, we haven't ever really fully surrendered to God. If when
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.060]   my children are young and I tell them to do five things, they say, "You know, I'm
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:07.500]   gonna do one and three, but two, you know, two, three, and five, I don't think so."
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:13.780]   Right? Well, I was obedient to one and three, but two, three, and five, I wasn't. No,
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:19.420]   you're disobedient. You're not partially obedient, you're disobedient, right? You
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:25.460]   don't pick and choose. So if Christ is our King, He is King of all things. You're
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.820]   not, He's not King on Monday and then Friday, and then Tuesday, Thursday,
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:35.300]   Saturday, I'm independent. He says the reason why they become hard of hearing
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.460]   is because they're not accustomed to the Word of Righteousness. They hear it, they
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:44.900]   have no intention of practicing it. In Romans chapter 2, 17 to 24, "But if you
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:50.780]   bear the name of the Jew, rely upon the law, and boast in God, and know His will,
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.460]   and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.380]   law, and are confident that you or yourselves are a guide to the blind, lie to those who
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.980]   are in darkness, a corrector of the foolish, teacher of the immature,
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.860]   having in the law the embodiment of knowledge of the truth, you therefore who
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:10.940]   teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.700]   you steal? You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:19.340]   adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? You who boast in the law, through
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.660]   your breaking the law, do you dishonor God? For the name of God is blasphemy
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:27.940]   among the Gentiles because of you, just as it is written." It is not because they
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:33.620]   didn't know. The reason why they became blind is because they didn't practice it.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:38.620]   It's not because God didn't make it clear. It wasn't that the Jews were there
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.700]   and then all of a sudden the Messiah showed up and it's like, "Well, God didn't
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:48.140]   make it clear." That's why they missed the Messiah. When Jesus said, "If you only
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.220]   knew what would truly bring peace, destruction would not be coming upon
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:57.260]   Jerusalem." It wasn't because God made it unclear. It wasn't because it was
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:04.100]   ambiguous. He says they know. They had the oracles of God. It was clearly taught. In
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:12.060]   fact, he was illustrated. He gave poems, narratives. He gives prophecies. He had
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:19.500]   miracles. I mean in every way, in every direction, it was pointing to Christ. But
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.180]   the reason why they missed it is because they knew to preach and they knew
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:30.380]   the truth, but they didn't practice it. That's why Jesus says of those, the
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.340]   scribes and the teachers, he says, "Do what they say because they sit in the seat of
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:41.620]   Moses. They're teaching you the law that God gave. Do listen to them, but do not do
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.780]   what they do because they're hypocrites. Everything that they do, they do it for
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   their own glory." He said the reason why they became blind and dull of hearing is
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.780]   not because they didn't have the truth. It's because they had no intention of
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:38:02.020]   following it. What causes us to become blind isn't lack of clarity, because it's
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.780]   clear. You know, people often say, "Well, you're a pastor. You know that because
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.860]   you're a pastor. You do that because you're a pastor. There is nothing that I
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:16.180]   have that you don't have access to. Nothing. The Scripture makes it very
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:22.900]   clear that everything that we need for a life of godliness has been given to us
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.100]   in the knowledge of his Son, Jesus Christ. Is that only for pastors and elders and
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:33.700]   apostles? Every single Christian, we already have it. A part of the reason why
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:39.980]   we oftentimes are disobedient is we say, "Well, I don't have enough of this." Only if
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.940]   we had a small group like that. Only if I joined that community group. Only if I
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.460]   was here. Only if I was there. And basically, it's justifying where we are.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:55.300]   I'm lukewarm because of this. I am the way I am because of this. I don't follow
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.580]   this because of this. But in the end, it's no different than Adam saying, "I ate the
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:06.660]   apple because of the woman that you put in the garden. She tempted me." He says,
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:11.500]   "Everything that we need for a life of godliness has been given to us. The same
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.660]   God that I have access to, that I get on my knees to pray and cry out to, is the
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:21.460]   same access that you have to the same God." When he says to draw near to the
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.260]   throne of grace with confidence that we may be able to find help
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:33.020]   and mercy in a time of need, it's not an invitation just to a few elect. It's to
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:43.100]   all of us. And so to justify our lukewarmness is to justify our sins. Let
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:49.180]   me say that again. To justify our lukewarmness is to justify our sins. You
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:55.840]   know what lukewarmness is? When the harshest rebuke came to the church of
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.980]   Laodicea because of the lukewarmness, he says, "You're neither hot nor cold. And
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:03.620]   because you're neither hot nor cold, I will spew you out of my mouth." I mean,
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:10.020]   that's the illustration that we see is God disgusted. When you spew
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.140]   something out of the mouth, it isn't just like, "Oh, this is not good." It's like, "Pfft!"
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:19.300]   You ever eat something like that that was that bad? Maybe it's spoiled.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.580]   Maybe you thought it was good milk and you were just chugging it like, "Ugh, milk!" And
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:28.540]   then in your mouth it's yogurt-y. You know what I mean? And you know you didn't
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:35.500]   grab yogurt. It's like, "Pfft! What is that?" That's how it's described. God takes it,
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.820]   "You're neither hot nor cold, and because you are lukewarm, I will spit you out of
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:45.300]   my mouth." It disgusts God. You know what lukewarmness is? Lukewarmness is room
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.940]   temperature. When you get a hot coffee and just leave it out without
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.460]   external help, what happens? It turns into room temperature. So if the room is cold,
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.980]   it'll get cold. If his room is hot, it'll get hot. So lukewarm is somebody who's
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:04.380]   constantly adjusting to their environment. So if you happen to be with
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.100]   a group of people on fire, you kind of act like you're on fire. But as soon as
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.940]   they lose fire, you lose fire. If you happen to be with a bunch of people who
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.780]   are liberal, you become liberal. If you happen to be with a bunch of people who
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:21.060]   are one-way, you become like that. But it's not your faith. So lukewarmness
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.140]   isn't always cold. It's not always hot. It's just whatever the room temperature
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:31.460]   is. Matthew chapter 24, 12 to 13 says, "Because of lawlessness is increased,
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.660]   most people's love will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end, he will
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:42.820]   be saved." You notice here, first of all, who is he talking to? Is he talking to
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.740]   non-Christians in Matthew 24? He said, "Because of increase of lawlessness."
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:54.080]   Now let's get this. Let's be on the same page on this. I've been a
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.460]   Christian for 30-some years, 36 years. And I could tell you, and I
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:04.600]   think there's other people in this room who can testify, Christianity, as we see
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:10.020]   it today, if I went into coma 36 years ago and I woke up today, I wouldn't
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.260]   recognize Christianity. That's how far we've drifted. And I'm not even just
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.660]   talking about the pews. I'm talking about even from the pulpit. That's how far
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.100]   we've drifted. And I'm not even talking about what's going on out there. I'm
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:27.380]   talking about inside the church. What has become acceptable within the church,
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.540]   Christians from just 30 years ago, would not be able to recognize what's
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.420]   going on today. That's how far we've come. When he says, "Because of increase of
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.420]   lawlessness," we have to agree that lawlessness has increased in our
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.820]   generation, especially in the last five years, right? It's just crazy what they're
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.740]   trying to push even in our public schools. I mean, you don't have to be a
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:52.860]   Christian to think that that's strange. Again, not going into details, I
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.060]   think a lot of the parents are already aware of what's going on, but what they're
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:02.420]   trying to push to our kindergartners is disgusting. You don't have to be a
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:09.260]   Christian to agree with me. That's how far it's come, right? And he says, "Because of
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:14.180]   the increase of lawlessness, the love of most will grow cold." First of all, he's
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.980]   not talking to the outside world because non-Christians didn't have the love to
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.140]   begin with. What's there to grow cold? That they're not gonna love their
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.660]   mothers or fathers or their children? That's not gonna change. They're not
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.540]   talking to Christians. Who is he talking to? He's talking to Christians in the
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:37.620]   church. Love of who? Most. Not a lot of people. He says, "Most." Because of the
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:43.180]   pressure coming from the outside, if you are in the habit of adjusting, lukewarm,
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:48.980]   and continue to drift, your passion is going to be dependent upon your
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.660]   circumstance. And so because the circumstance, the pressure is increasing,
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:44:02.340]   love of not a few, not a lot, but he says, "Most." So if you agree with me, if you
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:06.860]   agree with me that the wickedness has been increasing in an exponential manner
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.860]   in the last 10 years, especially the last five years, then you will also agree with
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:18.380]   me that love of most has grown cold. Because that's what he says will happen.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:26.180]   And he says, "Love of most will grow cold, but the one who endures." You notice how
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.140]   he says most people will grow cold, but then when he talks about perseverance,
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:37.620]   but the one, right? I don't think that's by accident. He's telling the church, "You
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:44.660]   will be few." Broad is the path that leads to destruction, and easy is its way, but
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:50.260]   narrow and few will be found on the path that leads to eternal life. That is not by
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:58.820]   accident. That is not by accident. And that's why he says, "Solid food is for the
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:06.260]   mature." I was talking to a pastor a while back, and it was when we were going
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:12.060]   through the book of Isaiah, and he asked me, "People actually come to that?" That's
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:17.380]   what he said. He listened to the Bible studies online. "You're teaching Isaiah."
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.580]   So he said he actually started listening to our Bible study
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.140]   online, and he was kind of surprised, especially because the age of our church.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:28.100]   You know what I mean? Like, "Okay, maybe Christians from a different generation,
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.620]   maybe different, but we have a lot of young people at our church, and they come to
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.540]   listen to this?" That's what he...you know, it would have been offensive if I had
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.220]   heard any other context, right? But he's like, "They come listen to this?" He said, "Yeah."
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:45.220]   In fact, once they get accustomed to listening to that, it's hard for them to
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:49.060]   listen to anything else. Once they get hunger for that, it's hard for them to
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:54.060]   listen to anything else. But he just couldn't believe it. And he said, "I'm
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:58.620]   thinking about doing that." That's what he said. "I'm thinking about possibly
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:03.460]   starting to do more expositional teaching." But then he was honest with me.
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:11.100]   He said, "But what if they don't come?" That's what he said. And I was trying to
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.420]   encourage this pastor. I said, "Pastor, you can't teach one way or another because
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.740]   they're gonna come. You have to teach because you're convicted that that's the
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.500]   right thing to do. Sometimes preaching the truth is going to cause the church
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:31.620]   to shrink. Sometimes it may be in season. My experience has been there's more
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:36.860]   seasons when it's not in season, and more seasons where people don't want to
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.300]   listen to it, right? And there has been seasons when people were coming for that
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:46.180]   reason, right? But I said, "Pastor, you can't decide to do that because you're
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.980]   gonna bring more people. If that's the reason why you're doing it, it doesn't
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:54.580]   matter if you do expositional preaching." And he said, "Thanks for being
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:47:01.140]   honest with me." He said, "But to be honest, I'm afraid." You know, I said, "As a
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:05.300]   pastor, if the church doesn't grow, that means our church needs to shut down.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:11.980]   And his livelihood and his vision, all the energy poured into it, all of
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:16.860]   that is gonna go down the toilet. Now what if they don't come?" I understand the
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:23.500]   pressure, and I understand the temptation, but you're a minister of God, right? Before
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:29.020]   you're a servant of people, you're a servant of God. So you need to make a decision.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:34.780]   You pray. If God convicts you that this is the truth, then you need to preach it,
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:39.980]   in season and out of season. And then we pray together, we parted our ways. But I
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:47.220]   understand his temptation. I understand his temptation. And I know, you know, you
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.380]   want to have a mega church, you want to have more people to come to church, and
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.580]   I've had people come up to me and tell me, "If your sermons were just a little
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:48:00.620]   bit shorter, my friends would come." Right? "If your sermons were a little bit more
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:08.580]   encouraging, they would come." Some Sundays it is, but today it's not.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:15.180]   Right? But if you keep doing that, you know, I have some friends who don't want
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:22.540]   to come because of that. But I'm not here to fill the seats with as many people as
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:30.580]   I can. Before I'm your servant, I'm his servant. And I don't want to, like, you
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:35.220]   know, I have to face, you know, some people afterwards, but ultimately I have to face
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:42.180]   God. And that's why every letter Paul writes, right, he identifies himself as a
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:49.300]   servant of Christ or as an apostle of Jesus Christ. Because there are some
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.140]   things that he says in that letter that they're not going to like. There's
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.820]   something that he's going to say that they're going to refuse. But that's why
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.580]   he says, first and foremost, "Before I love you, before I care about you, I'm an
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:07.740]   apostle of Jesus. I'm a servant of Christ. I'm a bond servant." Whether they listen
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:15.540]   or not. He says, finally, "But solid food is for the mature, who because of
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:21.380]   practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil." Our ability to
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:27.940]   listen to the deep things of God is directly linked to our obedience. It's
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.900]   directly linked to our obedience. If we continue to live our lives in
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.220]   compromise and disobedience, it affects the way that you even understand the
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:40.780]   Word of God. You become hardened. There's no appetite. A lot of people come to
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:47.180]   church and things like, "Oh, you know, like, I don't get it." And part of
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:52.140]   the reason, not all of it, but part of the reason why is because you don't bring
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:58.740]   appetite into the church. I mean, I get it. Sometimes my sermons are no good.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:03.700]   I could have done better. It's not because of lack of trying. It's just
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:09.500]   hard every single week. Trying to be fresh every single week for 22
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:15.220]   years. So it's hard. Speaking to the same people. So when I go to retreats,
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:19.980]   I got 22 years I can pull from. But when I church,
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:24.580]   every illustration is like, "I did that last week." You know what I
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.940]   mean? "I said that the week before, a year before." So it's hard. So I get it. So if
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.740]   you don't like some of the sermons, I don't blame you. I'd have a
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:40.180]   hard time listening to me every single week. So not all of it is that, but
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:45.380]   sometimes the reason why we don't have appetite is because we're already full
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:51.780]   when we come. It doesn't matter how great the banquet is. If you've
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:56.780]   been eating cup ramen from morning till six o'clock, and all of a sudden you say,
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:02.780]   "This filet mignon is not as good." It's not good. If somebody else comes in
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:09.380]   hungry, it's like even white rice tastes awesome. When somebody is coming
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:14.020]   hungry, and they're hungering and thirsting for righteousness, even a
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:22.100]   little taste of stale bread tastes good for them. But when you're filled by
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:27.780]   nibbling in the things of this world, John MacArthur, John Piper, John Owens,
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:33.940]   all the Johns in the world give the best sermon that they can give, but
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:40.820]   you don't have an appetite. Even Jesus himself, when he preached, they didn't
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:49.180]   have an appetite. He said solid food is for the mature, because of their practice,
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:56.380]   have their senses trained to discern good and evil. So as a wrap-up this
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:03.860]   morning, the only Christian who fails is the one who quits. So let's establish
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.780]   that, okay? So he's not saying the warning is not like, "Well, if you don't try hard
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.220]   and if you don't get an A, you're not gonna make it into the kingdom of God."
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:15.300]   That's not what he's saying. What he is saying is there's no reason for
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:21.860]   Christians to quit. The fact that we have a tendency to drift, that's all of us. It's
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.580]   not just a few of you. The fact that we are tempted and we sometimes give in to
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:30.140]   our temptation, that's not just a few of you. That's all of us. We all have a
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:35.460]   tendency at times, having a hard time to be obedient to God. We all struggle with
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:41.700]   that. But there is no excuse for a Christian to continue to drift, because
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:47.220]   he already paid the price. The door has already been opened. The battle has
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:53.980]   already been won. So when we see that warning sign, if you believe, there is no
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:58.540]   reason not to pay attention. So only an unbeliever will listen to this and say,
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:03.020]   "Ah, forget it," because they don't believe. All of this is nonsense. But if you are a
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:10.140]   child of God and you've caught your heart being hardened, it's been months
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:15.940]   and years since you cried out to God. It's been months and years since you
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:20.900]   prayed and cried out to God. It's been months and years since you've been
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:26.220]   praising His name, but it was just all lip service. If that's where you are,
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:32.460]   return. Remember the height from which you had fallen, repent, and redo the
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:37.680]   things that you did at first. So again, my prayer is as we welcome our
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:43.300]   worship team to come back up, let's take some time to come before the Lord
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:49.700]   again and be honest and pray and be fervent. If your heart has become hardened
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:55.940]   for whatever the reason, don't justify that. Come before the Lord, consider
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:54:00.620]   who He is and what He has done, and receive the blessing that only He can
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:05.340]   give. Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
