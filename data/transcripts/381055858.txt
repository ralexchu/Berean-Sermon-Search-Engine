[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Our Heavenly Father, we want to give you thanks.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.320]   Lord, we take time gathered together to consider you, both, Father Lord, your works in history
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.280]   past, the amazing redemptive work you have accomplished in Christ, but what's more, your
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.120]   humble heart, God, your heart of love.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.920]   And we know, Father Lord, all things come forth from your character and who you are.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.720]   And so today we want to thank you and praise you, lift up to you everything we have, including
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720]   our hearts and our minds.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.720]   We thank you, Lord, in Christ's name we pray.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.720]   Amen.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.400]   It was sweet to see just the many photos, you know, of the children.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.280]   I want you to take a moment to think about a time when you saw your own photo.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.560]   And I'm not sure if maybe you've had an experience, especially in times when you go visit your
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.240]   parents and holidays and things like that, maybe you see old photos of yourself on their
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.000]   wall and little picture frames.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.720]   What's your reaction when you see those photos?
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.280]   Do you think, "Oh, look at me, so cute.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.280]   What happened to me?"
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.520]   Maybe we get very nostalgic, thinking back, "I remember those times.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.160]   We didn't have much, but it was so sweet because we were together," or something like that.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.480]   What's more, if you've seen little baby pictures of yourself, it's trippy.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.200]   Trippy meaning it just kind of makes you feel a little weird because it does humble you
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200]   to some degree.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200]   You're like tiny.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.760]   You know, you're the size of somebody's forearm.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.880]   You're very vulnerable.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.640]   And everything about you is just so small and innocent, right?
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.120]   Eyes are all big, skin is all peachy, toes, nose, everything all tiny.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.560]   And it just makes you feel a sense of, "Oh, this is precious.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.480]   What a precious, precious thing."
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.200]   And then you get kind of weirded out because that's you, right?
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.320]   But honestly speaking, anytime we see any baby photo or an image of a precious child,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320]   it is heartwarming.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.680]   I mean, lately there's been photos of Yoda going around that's baby and everybody loves
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.720]   it, right?
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.120]   I want you to take a moment to ask a strange question though, is because today is, you
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.640]   know, we're approaching Christmas and this is Christmas Sunday.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   We are thinking about our Lord, Jesus Christ.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.600]   And the crazy truth and historical event is that Jesus Christ came, went through the full
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.080]   gamut of human experience, including being born in a natural way, in such a vulnerable
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.480]   fashion.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.220]   That alone is just amazing and mind-blowing.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.880]   But then I took a moment and paused and started thinking a weird thought, which is, "Hmm,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.280]   what if Jesus had photos of himself as a baby?
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.480]   Would he look upon himself in the same way?
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.120]   Oh, look at me, all peachy and small and cute."
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.440]   And strangely enough, I took extra time to think about that and my word and theme of
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.440]   this sermon to you is going to be that from that thought, I realized, "Hmm, I don't think
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.560]   I appreciate that coming of Christ as a baby enough because I don't think Jesus looks at
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.360]   that as some kind of precious, high privilege for him to come as a baby, but rather something
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.000]   entirely different."
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.160]   Now what we know is Jesus coming to this world as a human baby was a momentous, momentous
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.720]   event, a pivotal event in all of history.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.560]   Galatians chapter four talks about it this way, "When the fullness of time had come,"
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.400]   meaning this has been building up, it's a pivotal moment, "epic," yes?
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.240]   "God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law so that he might redeem
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.080]   those who are under the law, that we might receive the adoptions as sons."
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.200]   That's an amazing thing.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   However, we recognize that that amazing feat of Jesus coming to save and to redeem, to
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.320]   give us the precious gift of adoption, it came at his dissension.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.600]   He had to absolutely lower himself.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.760]   And so when I think about Jesus, potentially, in his perfect memory, thinking about the
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.080]   time as a baby, whereas we have commercialized it, where we have painted it, that he is this
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.240]   precious, precious baby in a precious, precious, sweet moment of peace, and the mother and
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.400]   father are surrounding him, I wonder if Jesus looks at that and says, "But that was my
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.440]   moment of great humiliation."
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:01.120]   That, to him, was being made lower, lower than angels.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.060]   That to him was being made even lower than, let's say, a full-grown human being.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.560]   This was a baby, vulnerable, dependent.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.640]   Precious, yes, but vulnerable.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.800]   To our Lord, he might have seen that as a moment not to look back on as saying, "Yay,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.680]   happy birthday to me," but potentially, "Do you recognize to what degree I've had to come
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   down?"
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.280]   And that's what we're talking about this morning, this Christmas Sunday.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.360]   And so, going to the very first point of the sermon, I want to make this case that Christ's
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.040]   infancy is to his humiliation.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.320]   That unlike maybe when we're looking at our photos, like, "Ah, that's so embarrassing.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   Now I had fuzzy hair or a huge head," or something like that, we are talking about his looking
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.720]   at the past historical event in a strange way.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.080]   Absolutely necessary, pivotal moment in history, and yet incredibly humbling for Christ.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.160]   Turn your Bibles, please, to Philippians 2, verses 5 through 8.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.040]   Philippians 2, verses 5 through 8.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.520]   This portion of Scripture says to us, "To have this attitude in yourselves, which was
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.180]   also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God, he did not regard equality
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.840]   with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.680]   and being made in the likeness of men, being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.240]   by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross."
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.520]   So when you look at that passage as a whole, think about the general statement that it's
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.520]   making.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.200]   What he's saying is, there is an attitude of humility, and the perfect example of that
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   is Jesus Christ.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.920]   Christ is the prime example of self-sacrificing humility.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.040]   And what he says is, he talks about his incarnation.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:16.040]   That although he existed in the form of God, and this therefore is my point A, that there
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.380]   is this massive contrast the Apostle Paul is trying to show us.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.080]   Jesus Christ was in the form, had the fullness of God Almighty.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.480]   Glorious, majestic, and sovereign.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.180]   And yet the repeated contrast is there is a progression.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.040]   And yet he took this form of a servant.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.460]   He took the form of a man.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.520]   He took the form of a man subject to death.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.480]   He took the form of a man subject to death on a cross.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.040]   Wow.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.760]   What huge contrast.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:53.480]   And the way I want us to think about it is, wow, what huge depth.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:01.760]   If we're talking about some kind of quantifiable distance of which our Savior had to come down,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.320]   think about this passage.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.760]   Scripture tells us in Colossians chapter 1 verse 16 through 19 that Jesus Christ was
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760]   fully God.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.080]   Verse 16 says this, "For by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth,
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.000]   visible, invisible, where the thrones, dominions, rulers, or authorities, all things have been
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.400]   created through him and for him."
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.640]   Wow.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.280]   What's more, he is before all things and in him all things hold together.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.120]   He is both the beginning, the sustainer.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.520]   He is the source of everything.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.320]   Verse 18, "He is also the head of the body, the church.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.680]   He's the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself will come to have
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.960]   first place in everything.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.240]   For it was the Father's good pleasure," look at this, "for all the fullness to dwell in
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.120]   him."
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.040]   That means the fullness of God's authority.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.000]   In Scripture we'll talk about that.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.100]   The fullness of his power.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.100]   The fullness of his glory.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.640]   The fullness of the praise and worship that all the host of heavens gives to him.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.840]   That belongs to Christ.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:17.900]   And then Scripture says, "Although he was here," but look at this, "we have to think
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:26.120]   in this time and wrap our minds, try, at least chip away at the immense, the immense humility
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.120]   of Christ."
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.120]   Amen?
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.900]   He has come down so far, and the case that I want to make to you is, that to us should
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:40.280]   shock us, because if then Jesus is fully God and he deserves all of heaven's praises, anything
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.380]   less than that is, guess what?
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.040]   Wrong.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.060]   It's inappropriate.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.940]   It's humiliating.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.900]   It could even be offensive.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:57.740]   But then Scripture teaches us that even though it was, although he had this form of God,
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.420]   he humbled himself.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.220]   Now in order to make this case even more emphatic, what I'd like to say is, the kind of birth
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:11.660]   that Jesus had, the arrival of our Savior Jesus Christ onto this world, if that was
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.420]   applied, or that was the experience of even a human king, even that would be humiliating.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420]   Right?
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:25.180]   That's point B. If you think about this, even somebody who is human, but is of high-ranking
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.460]   authority, this kind of birth and entry into this world is still humiliating.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.700]   I mean, you imagine with me, if you were royalty, you know?
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:39.580]   You were in Europe, and you are in the royal line, and your whole life, not your whole
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.940]   life, but the life of the family, the whole heritage, was all this incredible palm, and
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:50.620]   pageantry, and dress up, and you live in the castle, and all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.940]   And imagine if you were, let's say you're an adult now, and you're all grown up, and
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.780]   yeah, you're a king, let's say you're a prince, whatever it may be, you're royalty.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.340]   You look at your family photos, and all of a sudden, you catch a picture of a baby, and
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.740]   it's straight up by the litter box.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.980]   It's with the farm animals.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.460]   What is this?
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.780]   Right?
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.540]   Would you like to show that photo?
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:17.620]   Hey, let me send you my Christmas card, the nativity scene.
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.580]   It would just be an unfit, it would just be embarrassing, it's like, what is this?
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:28.540]   Would you have me be born next to sheep, inside the trough, in the feed?
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.540]   That's embarrassing.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:36.980]   You see, Jesus Christ, even on his birth, yes, was hailed as a king, and people thought
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.180]   that he would be an amazing human king.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:46.060]   He had prophecy predicting it, he had people confirming it, and yet he was born.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.260]   No vacancy, no VIP reservation, next to animals.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.180]   Now just to put a little bit more tangibleness to that, have you guys ever taken kids to
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.060]   a petting zoo?
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.940]   Place is gross.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.300]   People think it's a great idea, you take your kids, and they're like, let's go, it's like,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.460]   yeah, let's pet the sheep.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.640]   You get over there, sheep aren't nice, they're not nice.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.020]   You get down low to them, they want to knock you over.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.820]   What's more, just being real, the stench of urine is unbearable.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.620]   The smell.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.380]   And all of a sudden, the parents get up, like, did you wash your hands, did you wash your
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.380]   hands?
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.380]   Hurry up, let's pet that thing and leave.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.980]   Okay, why do I say this?
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.980]   I even have this photo, I believe right now, it's just too commercialized almost, where
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:37.060]   we have this perfect image, like we think, we think that outside of the privileges of
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.300]   having a nurse with you, a doctor with you, that mother and father, young, I believe they
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:48.780]   were, Mary was probably really young, forced to give birth to their child next to animals
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:54.260]   with the stench of their feces, and they come out looking like this.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.940]   All of us, we know, dude, after labor and delivery, you don't look like that, okay?
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.420]   Now why am I saying this?
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:07.140]   Even for a high-ranking human, this is humbling.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.300]   How much more than the God who created this.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:18.700]   To be born in such circumstances, to be born in such scenarios, and let me even make it
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.780]   more emphatic to you, please take another moment to fantasize and imagine with me that
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:31.060]   Jesus, rather than coming to this world as a baby, he came into this world like Terminator,
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.800]   where he materialized, and when he stood up, he was perfect.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.500]   His hair was thick and black, there was not a single white hair on him.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.060]   His shoulders was broad, his chin, this line was defined.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.420]   What other things do we want to be?
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:53.260]   He was tall, he had a great deep voice, and he was muscular, not the gross muscular, but
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.620]   the right muscular.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:05.260]   Now I say that, yes, a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but if he was an amazing specimen of a human
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:12.180]   being, that we would all be like, "Wow, look at him, he's perfect," right?
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:20.220]   That would still be humiliating for God to enter that form, right?
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:26.860]   For the one who is timeless to touch time, a finite limited space, for one who surpasses
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:33.160]   all material to now come into this material world, subject to the need of food and water,
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.980]   like he would get tired.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.980]   That's humiliating.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.980]   That's humiliating.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.400]   Have you thought about this?
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.740]   We should, because during this Christmas time, we are remembering the moment when our Savior
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.500]   came down.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.540]   C.S. Lewis puts it in this way, he's a great British writer, somebody with a great imagination,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.220]   and he writes in his book called The Miracles.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:06.060]   He says, "In the center of the Christian story, the center of the Christian story, God descends."
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.740]   This is a miracle.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:14.160]   He comes down, down from the heights of absolute being, an eternal being down into time, an
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:20.100]   ever-present being down into space, down into humanity, flesh and bone, down to the very
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:27.680]   roots and the seedbed of humanity of which he himself created, stooping lower and lower
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.500]   to get himself underneath this great complicated burden of mankind.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.300]   Wow, well put.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.420]   If we think about the incarnation, we have to look up, and I'm challenging every single
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:48.240]   one of you during this time, look up and see the depth to which Christ has descended, because
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:56.880]   letter C is that Christ emptied himself of all of this, right?
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.820]   For him to have the fullness of God, including then the glories, the honors, the riches,
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.780]   the exercise of his authority, his rights and privileges, and then to empty and pour
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:15.580]   that all out, that to us is the grace and love we hear in the gospel, amen?
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.480]   That is our Lord freely pouring out and giving to us.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.140]   And so I want to challenge every single one of us, let's not have some strange commercialized
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:31.100]   view of Christmas, or even in our best intentions, thinking we're going to sing happy birthday
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.500]   to Jesus, you know?
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.180]   It's going to be a sweet time, almost like we're going to encourage him and remember
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:42.740]   you on your birthday, because I'm not sure Jesus actually sees it that way, neither is
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   that the reality.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:52.860]   This is an incredible paradox, great humiliation for our Savior, exuding joy and celebration
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.100]   for us, amen?
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:01.380]   Moving to point number two, the idea of the dissension of our Deliverer, our Savior Jesus
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.340]   Christ gets more intensified.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:09.860]   Point two is that the descent of Jesus is even deeper than we assume, okay?
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:15.660]   The descent of Jesus coming down to us is even deeper than we would presume, why?
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.060]   Because just look at us.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.300]   You might be thinking, what do you mean just look at us?
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.620]   In the previous point, point number one, I said essentially look up to the heavens and
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.020]   see the depth to which Christ had to come down, but now what I'd like you to do is look
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:38.540]   at yourself and ask, why did Christ have to walk, or metaphorically walk and travel such
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.180]   distance?
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.900]   Where were you?
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:47.020]   In order to come to your aid, to the place that you are, to the circumstance and the
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.140]   state, the status quo that you are in, where did he have to go?
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.740]   Let me put it in another way.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.780]   When Jesus shows up and says, "I am here to save you and to help you and have come to
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.620]   your aid," you know what that normally does?
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.940]   It makes you look at yourself.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.500]   I'm in need?
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.300]   Do I need your help?
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.620]   There are times when I would look at the gospel narratives of Jesus' arrival and I'm sitting
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.940]   here thinking, why does the entire generation not get it?
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.220]   They literally knew where he was going to be born.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.460]   He was going to be born in a small city of Bethlehem.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.780]   You take the right turn over there and he's going to be in the state.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.220]   They were able to give directions.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.940]   There was a star for crying out loud, and these wise men from afar came even looking
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.500]   for him, and they asked the scribes if they knew exactly where he was.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.300]   How could people miss this?
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.820]   I think this is why.
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.940]   I think they failed to look at themselves.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.580]   He came to help, and rather than thinking, "Yes, we knew it.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.820]   We knew we were in help because I was sacrificing animals and it never worked, and my sin was
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.100]   right here and right here, and I can't get it out."
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.140]   But instead of doing that, they said, "What?
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.900]   Are you saying I'm sinful?
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.900]   You're saying I need your forgiveness?
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.060]   Somehow I need your help.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.660]   You show up one day and all of a sudden I need your help?
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.420]   Do you see what I'm saying?"
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:18.380]   And so A, I find a common sinfulness and a common error that across time mankind have
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.580]   shared, which is one, we typically try to devalue Jesus.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.660]   We bring him down and underestimate who he is, but the other is we overestimate who we
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.780]   are.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.620]   We regularly think that we're better.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.860]   "Ah, you know, I just messed up normally.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:39.220]   I'm like really good, but this time I was bad just this one time."
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.740]   Let's be real.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:46.700]   If we count the sins of our minds, the sins of our hearts, we sin regularly.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.580]   Scripture teaches us this, that we are so adverse.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.040]   Another way of putting this, that not only are we frequently overestimating ourselves,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:59.860]   we are so adverse to feeling guilty, feeling weak, feeling powerless, right?
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.160]   And we can admit to that.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.420]   We are so adverse to being guilty, but let me tell you this.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:15.540]   The arrival of the deliverer makes everyone feel guilty because that arrival then announces
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.320]   the reality of the state of affairs.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.340]   We are a broken generation.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.780]   Take a look at Philippians chapter two one more time, Philippians chapter two one more
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:30.020]   time and starting from verse six, it says this, again, "Although he existed in the form
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:37.380]   of God, he did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, meaning held onto,
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.140]   but he emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.420]   of men, being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.340]   the point of death, even death on a cross."
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.420]   And earlier, I highlighted and pointed out to you, did you notice that there is this
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.160]   sequential humbling or I guess progressive humbling that Apostle Paul points out?
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.700]   He says he didn't grasp it, but instead let go.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.300]   And then there was this being made in the likeness of men, lower, there's a being made
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:13.580]   in the likeness of a bondservant, which means slave, lower, and then he's being made one,
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.860]   like one who is subject to death.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:21.020]   That is incredible weakness when you don't last and you have an expiration date.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.060]   Lower, and then he says to the point of death on the cross.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:32.960]   Let's ask the question, as good students of the Bible, what categorical people, who dies
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.260]   on the cross?
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:42.820]   And the answer is criminals, people who break the law.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:51.620]   That symbol, the cross, was a symbol of punishment, that your crime of action, your crime of intent,
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.660]   you have been indicted, you have been convicted, and you are guilty and therefore deserving
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:04.980]   of a heinous death, being also propped up as a symbol of that consequence.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:11.540]   For Jesus Christ then to descend, point B, Christ descended to the form of a condemned
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.420]   criminal.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:21.800]   Think about that in that act and its relation to us.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.340]   We don't like being judged in our heart, meaning we don't like people assuming things of our
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.020]   intention and we say stuff like, "Oh, I know I hurt you, but you know I didn't mean it."
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.020]   It's like, "You meant it."
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.020]   It's like, "I did it."
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:40.700]   Truth be told, I'm a pastor and I'm regularly trying to work on my heart, but are there
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.740]   moments when I have rage in here?
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.740]   Sure do.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.700]   Are there moments when I feel hatred, embitterment, frustration?
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.700]   Sure do.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.840]   Do you know what scripture says?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.220]   Man who sits there hating his brother is a murderer.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.900]   All I need is the opportunity and I'll hurt that person.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.580]   That's what it's saying.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.980]   I am just simply confessing the fact that if we are real and honest with ourselves and
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.540]   with each other, there is a whole slot of various wickedness.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:16.380]   Yes, I am using the word wickedness and evil within all of us, within all of us.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.360]   Let me show you another passage.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:24.860]   In John chapter one, it summarizes in big overarching narrative the coming of Jesus.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.500]   This is what it says in John chapter one verses one through five.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.460]   In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:36.540]   He was in the beginning with God and all things came into being through him and apart from
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.080]   him nothing came into being that has come into being.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.340]   That's what we just reviewed.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.020]   Jesus is high.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.340]   Jesus is God.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.340]   Yes.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.380]   Verse four, in him was life and the light of the light of men.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.820]   And the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness did not comprehend it.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.660]   What am I saying?
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:03.100]   Jesus Christ, when he entered into this world, he didn't come to a nice, lovely community
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.180]   of people trying hard.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.620]   He didn't.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.020]   When Jesus Christ entered into the world, he walked into darkness.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.260]   What is he talking about?
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.900]   The geography of it all?
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.940]   The circumstance?
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.940]   The layout of the city?
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:24.340]   No, he's talking about the darkness of the times of the people.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.740]   There was wickedness.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.020]   Now I recognize that this is Christmas Sunday.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.100]   Perhaps many of you weren't expecting a sermon like this where I'm talking about the darkness
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.380]   of our generation and also the darkness of our heart.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:44.180]   But this portion of it is the reality of Christ's coming.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.420]   He didn't just come to help nice people in Irvine and Orange County and the greater LA
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.060]   area to do better at their jobs.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.820]   And at that time when he came, he didn't just come so that the Greeks and the Romans would
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.620]   get along and the Jews would too.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.180]   He came because there was depravity.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.860]   And you might be wondering and thinking, "Whoa, Pastor, are you just condemning everybody
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.100]   of vile wickedness?"
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.940]   And the answer is humbly yes.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.900]   The scripture says so.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.800]   The scripture says that we stand condemned.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.420]   The scripture says that we must accept this truth.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.380]   That wickedness is not out there.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.400]   The wickedness is here.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.140]   And so I give you this challenge.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.860]   James chapter four verses nine through 10 commands us, "Be miserable and mourn and weep
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.580]   and let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:43.460]   Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you."
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.740]   He says be miserable actually.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.460]   He says mourn and weep.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:55.220]   We have to accept that without Christ we are desperately lost in darkness.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.860]   Without Christ we are desperately lost in sin.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.700]   And this is not just simply a ploy to manipulate people.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.340]   This is the reality.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.900]   Otherwise Christ would not have to come.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.100]   This is the reality.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.320]   Otherwise Christ would not have to descend.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.600]   This is the absolute reality.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:21.100]   And I want to say, again, I recognize that perhaps today we do have family and friends.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.540]   I'm assuming that there are people in here who, you know you're not a Christian, maybe
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.260]   you have certain reservations about it.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.340]   Isn't all faith the same?
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.500]   Something like that, you know?
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:38.940]   But I want to share with you what's strange to me is that every single religion understands
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.760]   there is some kind of sin, evil, wickedness, right?
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.280]   Every single person does.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.680]   And you don't have to be a religious person to know certain things are vile, certain things
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:57.480]   are virtues, certain things are criminal and evil, yes?
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.720]   But the apprehension comes when all of a sudden that finger starts pointing not at the world
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.760]   because everyone would say it, right?
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.920]   This world is like wicked.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.400]   Yes, we all have the news.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.440]   We could point to various things, pointing here and pointing there.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.240]   It just gets super troubling when that finger starts coming towards me.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.240]   That's how it is.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:23.260]   And I'll confess right here, prior to becoming a Christian, I was a vile, wicked man.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.080]   Incredibly filled with rage.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.680]   There were moments when I got into many, many fights.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.640]   I was a vile, wicked man.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.080]   Incredibly filled with lust, selfish desire, concern only for myself.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.800]   All the things that you would think as vice, it was here in abundance.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.480]   It was here in abundance.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.480]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   I have to prove.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.480]   Do I?
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:52.520]   I mean, do you have to prove to the world like this world is full of decay, it's not
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.520]   just weak, there's like wickedness here.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.640]   Do you have to prove that?
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:02.800]   It's like all around us and many of you have been hurt by it, like directly hurt by it.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.640]   But here's the trouble.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.960]   The question is, so where do you turn?
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:12.520]   You see, all since the beginning of the history of mankind, people have turned every which
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.520]   way.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.520]   Maybe I can hide it.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.520]   I'm going to hide.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   Like, where are you, Adam?
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   I've sinned.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.800]   It's like, I can see you behind the bush.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.560]   People have tried different things to deflect.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.800]   It's like, what happened?
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.480]   She did it.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.020]   People have turned to whatever which way.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.020]   Anything that will help.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.640]   People have sometimes said to me, when I share with people, just recently I was at the mall,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.640]   we had a wedding there.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.640]   Oh wow, this was yesterday.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.640]   I was at the mall and we were talking and I just told somebody, I said, "What are you
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.640]   doing?"
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   I said, "I'm going to church."
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   And they said, "Oh, that's so good.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.640]   It's good to have faith generally."
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.880]   And I'm sitting there like, "Ugh, no.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.320]   I'm not just turning to faith because it's helpful, because it's beneficial."
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   Right?
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.000]   Because otherwise I could turn a faith into, "I believe in Santa.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.240]   Makes me feel better.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.960]   Frosty, he makes me feel really encouraged."
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.920]   Rudolph, he goes from a, "Oh man, he's a runt."
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.920]   And all that kind of stuff.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.920]   "Can't do anything."
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.920]   "Leave my sled."
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   It's like, "Yay.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   Makes me feel better."
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   That's not what we're talking about.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:14.880]   People turn every which way to find the solution for the feeling they have of deficiency in
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.720]   their lives.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:23.800]   Both the weakness, susceptibility, and also the vital things they look into their lives.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:30.040]   The challenge is, first and foremost, to not be frustrated, to not give up, to not be arrogant
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.500]   and be like, "No.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.120]   I'm not as bad as them.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.320]   No, I'm not sinful."
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.080]   The challenge is to accept it.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.600]   Because that is a part of the whole story.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.520]   And what's more, I want to give this challenge.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.280]   Please do not resist what Christ is doing when he shows up and he is saying, "I am here
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.680]   to deliver you.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.440]   I am here to save you.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.040]   I am here to do for you that which you cannot do."
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.000]   Do not resist.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.880]   Point three is to resist Christ is both foolish and offensive.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:07.200]   To resist Christ when he appears and his presence comes before you is absolute foolishness.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   Absolute foolishness.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.040]   Have you guys ever tried to help a young child who's trying to do an art project?
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.280]   They're doing something together, making a mess, glue's everywhere, their hands are starting
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.400]   to get all solidified.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.880]   And you walk over and you're like, "Let me help you."
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.280]   You try to touch their hands to help them.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   They're like, "No.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.600]   I can do it."
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.480]   Is that foolishness or is that cute?
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.600]   When they're young, it's cute.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.800]   And then it becomes really bad, right?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.600]   It's not cute anymore.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.160]   Imagine God is reaching down because he sees we're making a mess.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.420]   We're only making things worse.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.360]   But to slap his hand away and say, "I can do this."
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.320]   Absolute foolishness.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.600]   He would say to us, "You know, I just tried to reveal to you how much I've had to come
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.880]   down and how much I've had to sacrifice.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:01.000]   I just tried to show to you how deep you are in sin and the kind of pit that you live in
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.080]   is unredeemable by your flesh.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   Why?
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.280]   Because your flesh is corrupt."
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.720]   And then here you are, "I can do it.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.520]   Let me do it."
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.480]   That is absolute foolishness.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.180]   And there's an entire book called the Book of Proverbs that says, "Open your heart and
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.680]   your mind to the instruction of the Lord."
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.600]   We have to do that.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:27.600]   But I just want to give this further warning that resisting Christ is not only utter foolishness,
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.480]   it is offensive.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.280]   And what I like to say is not only is it offensive, but think about this.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.800]   It is doubly offensive.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.440]   It's placing sin upon sin.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.880]   Why?
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.680]   I would like to highlight a special passage for you.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.880]   And it comes from John chapter three, verses 17 through 20.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.640]   John chapter 16 is a very, very famous verse.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.640]   Many people know it.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.520]   "For God so loved the world."
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520]   Right?
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.640]   Now, here, take a look at what he says immediately after.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.280]   "For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.320]   be saved through Him.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   He who believes in Him is not judged.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.800]   He who does not believe has been judged already because he has not believed in the name of
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.080]   the only begotten Son of God."
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.640]   Already there.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.720]   It shows you.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.520]   Verse 19, "This is the judgment that the light has come into the world.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.000]   And the men love the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.120]   For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light for fear that
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.100]   his deeds will be exposed."
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.480]   Think about this.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.520]   How is this doubly offensive?
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   Clearly so.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   Why?
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:50.280]   Because first and foremost, we already, according to this passage, we already stand condemned.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:55.680]   Underneath the lives that we've been living, the history of mankind, there has been a plethora
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.840]   of sin.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.480]   We live like God doesn't exist.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.920]   We do whatever we want to.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.840]   We follow our desires and appetites.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.440]   The list can go on and on and on.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.000]   But God, He sends His Son with mercy.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.600]   He recognizes some of you are just so ignorant.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.160]   I need to teach you.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   Some of you are hardened.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.880]   I need to soften you up.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.680]   Some of you, you need an example.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.680]   Some of you are weak.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.200]   I need to strengthen you.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:27.280]   And Christ comes not to judge, but to do all of that, to heal, to minister, to convict
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.720]   of sin, and to rescue.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:41.640]   And if you see that and you resist, that is sin upon sin, and it is offensive.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.040]   What's more, if you have this attitude of like, "You know what?
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.840]   I know I need help.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.840]   I know I'm not superhuman.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   Everybody knows we need people around us.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.600]   But saying I need all this, and I need all that, that's too much.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.960]   That's too much.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.720]   All I need is X, Y, and Z."
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:07.600]   To not admit that you need Christ, but to think that you need just little bits of help,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.880]   that is absolutely also offensive.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.320]   And let me now speak to some of the Christian brothers and sisters in here.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.680]   I've been counseling many, many people, and what I find is that sometimes the scenarios
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.280]   of your lives are very difficult, and genuinely so.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.320]   Good.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:29.800]   But if we sometimes act like all we need in our lives is just that small fix, "Help me
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.080]   and my family just stop having so much strife, and maybe just give me a better family," or
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   something like that.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   You just need that small fix.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   "Give me the skills to have that job, to persevere in this.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.080]   Give me this and this."
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.000]   And you feel like that's all you need, and all you would need in life, in this life,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.320]   is to have that rectified, and then you'd be good.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.880]   Think about how offensive that is.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.600]   Let me explain.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.000]   For us, we're all children to our parents, no matter how old you are.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.320]   Try going to your parents when you're younger, and you are so dependent on them.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.600]   And you say, "You know what I was thinking?
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.160]   I think I'm fine without you.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.640]   All I needed in that moment of time was your car, and I would have been good."
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.240]   That would be such a slap in the face to your parents.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   Really?
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.480]   You didn't need people to feed you 18 plus years of your life?
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   Really?
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.560]   All you needed was a car, huh?
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.520]   That kind of mentality of thinking, "All I need is just one thing from you, one thing
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.520]   from you."
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:38.200]   That would be for you to act like you did not receive the greatest thing from Him.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.440]   We can't think like that.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:46.760]   And so I want to say now, I know the sermon so far has been a bit convicting and heavy
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.080]   because we talked about sin.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.160]   But when we realize these things, this is when we celebrate.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.240]   So point four, point four.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.280]   If we know that we are in desperate need, lost without Jesus, if we know that our Savior
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.400]   is capable, and He has freely and willingly sacrificed and humbled Himself to come down
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:17.760]   to us, then we will now recognize, "I have exactly what my soul needs, my Deliverer and
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.440]   Savior."
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.960]   And this is why we celebrate together all the various experiences of being lost, being
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   frustrated, being stuck in your sin.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.280]   Now you have freedom in Christ because that Savior is going to free you.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.320]   All that you've been looking for of overcoming your greatest fears, your longing for your
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.940]   greatest loves, these are satisfied in Christ Jesus, amen?
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:48.360]   To us as we celebrate Christmas, we are saying, "Wrapped up in this Savior is everything I
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   need."
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:55.240]   Let me turn with you to a passage in Hebrews chapter two, a beautiful passage highlighting
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:02.360]   again the importance of the incarnation, the rationale beyond why Jesus had to come just
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   like us.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.520]   Hebrews chapter two, verses 14 through 16.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:11.800]   "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.760]   of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death,
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760]   that is the devil.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:23.880]   He might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:31.220]   For surely He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendants of Abraham."
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:37.000]   We are here at an incredibly privileged position.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.960]   Christ has already come.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.000]   And that first coming, He has said, "I did not come to judge, although I could."
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.440]   He could have very easily come and said, "You know what?
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.440]   I know the future.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.200]   I know how this is going to turn out.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.240]   You're all going to reject me.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.240]   This place is dark.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.160]   I'm going to judge all of you."
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.880]   He would have been justified to do so.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.680]   But He came with forgiveness in His heart.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   He came to save.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.320]   And what He says to us now is, "Yes, He is coming with that help and aid, but that's
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.080]   help and aid to you.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:15.940]   The only problem is, are we willing to trust the helping hand, the merciful sacrifice,
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.000]   the great descent of our Savior?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.720]   Are we willing to trust ourselves to Him?"
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:27.480]   If you have not experienced the freedom of doing that, let me tell you from personal
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:33.100]   experience, that is the definition of freedom.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:40.840]   To be in the safety, to be in the forgiving, loving hands of God, that equates freedom.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:46.260]   You can be free all you want from the things you think are problems and solutions in your
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:52.460]   life, but if you are still living with your fallen heart and mind, you are not free.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.440]   It'll haunt you till the day you die.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:04.780]   But to be forgiven, washed, cleansed by the Savior, this to us is our deliverance.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:10.740]   And so today we remember Jesus Christ who has come down, humbled Himself to such great
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:17.740]   depths, sacrificed to the point of dying on the cross to help us.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.420]   Would we with great trust, great faith receive that?
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.580]   I want to end with this passage, Philippians chapter two, verse nine.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:29.860]   For this reason also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:36.020]   every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:41.100]   and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.340]   is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:53.220]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:40:00.740]   Lord God, we took time to meditate on the height from which you came down.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:07.980]   We cannot even fathom what you had to let go of just to help us.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:12.380]   But for that Lord we thank you so much, what grace you have given us.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.340]   We also took time to meditate, Lord, the depth of our sin and how deep into the muck you
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.540]   had to travel.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:28.900]   God, to sympathize with our weakness, to experience the limitation, to experience also the many
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.020]   shameful things that happen in this darkness.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:38.060]   But thank you so much, God, that you are willing to experience all of that so that Lord you
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.940]   would deliver us and God that you would rescue us.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.820]   Praise and worship be to you.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.500]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name, amen.
