[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.520]   God, that you would lead our worship of you,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.680]   that you would be glorified in these lyrics as we sing them,
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.120]   that we would reflect on them,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.520]   and that we would lift them up to you
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.520]   as our praise and our worship of you.

[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.580]   Hey, let me take a moment to pray for us,
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:24.460]   and then we'll go jump into the review.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.380]   All right, let's pray.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:30.940]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your precious word.
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:34.100]   We thank you, God, that you grant to us light,
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.020]   you grant to us illumination,
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.380]   and Lord, it's by your spirit,
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.500]   you allow us to feel the conviction, Lord,
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.580]   even if the letter is correcting and rebuking,
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.400]   God, that you grant to us sanctification.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.860]   Lord, ultimately, that you exercise your power
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.660]   to draw us near and closer to the image of Christ.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:56.020]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.540]   Okay.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:58.380]   So,
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:03.300]   I love these last lesson of the series.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.340]   You guys all go all out with your snacks.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.180]   I hope you guys got a chance to actually
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:10.420]   talk about the passage on top of your eating.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.920]   Well, let's take a look at the short segment
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.820]   that we have at the very end,
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.900]   and it says, "And those who will walk by this rule,
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.020]   "peace and mercy be upon them,
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.780]   "and upon the Israel of God.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.420]   "From now on, let no one cause trouble for me,
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.220]   "for I bear on my body the brand marks of Jesus.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.620]   "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit,
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.500]   "brethren, amen."
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:41.500]   When I think about just concluding segments of any letter
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.220]   in the scriptures, it's quite amazing,
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:47.320]   because in just a cursory reading,
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.260]   it just sounds like your typical,
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:54.260]   blessed be God, may he bless you, amen, goodbye, right?
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.500]   But if you look at every letter,
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.460]   the scriptures are so deep,
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.240]   they summarize all the major concepts
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:07.060]   into those few words, and it's no different here.
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.180]   When we take a look just at verse 16
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.320]   and start asking the questions,
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.360]   we know that he's summarizing the fact that
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.500]   the people who are truly blessed, right?
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.260]   The people who receive peace and mercy
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:24.660]   are those who follow this rule, okay?
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.100]   And in a sense, that is the encapsulation
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.180]   of what he's saying, is you guys saw the way of law,
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.780]   you guys saw the way of fleshly righteousness,
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.700]   but I wanted you to see the way of true blessing,
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.660]   which is freedom in the spirit.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.920]   That's essentially the entire letter,
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.060]   just like summarized into one simple sentence.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.520]   But in a more narrow and specific observation,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.740]   we wanna ask the question, what rule is he talking about?
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:54.680]   Okay, what rule is he talking about?
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.900]   Now, I thought the term for rule was quite interesting
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.780]   and worthy of our time, because it's the word canon.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.340]   It is where we get the term,
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.520]   the canon of scripture, so to speak.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.120]   It means anything that is a straight line
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:12.020]   used to examine, to measure things up.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.860]   And so it was used of plumb lines,
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.280]   you hang a weight to make sure that something
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.060]   is straight and true as it's being constructed,
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.660]   or a straight line, like this is the edge,
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.220]   this is the measurement, okay?
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.200]   And so when we think about that,
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:32.200]   it's worthy for us to ask, how would you summarize
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.080]   this idea of the rule that Apostle Paul
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.960]   wants you to live by, okay?
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.200]   Just before this segment, he also summarized
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.520]   what he was saying in a very specific argument.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.440]   He said, you know what?
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.840]   In conclusion, circumcision is nothing.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.760]   As a matter of fact, uncircumcision
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.380]   or circumcision is nothing, but what?
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:57.780]   New creation, okay, a new creation.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.260]   So I want you guys to think about that,
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.900]   the beauty in just that statement, a new creation, okay?
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.060]   A new creation is the rule.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:06.960]   Why do I say this?
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   It's because then, in contrast, just doctrinal assent,
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.840]   all I know, is that enough?
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.380]   No.
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.420]   Just simply being a part of a group,
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:24.220]   oh, I am now part of the crew, I am now part of this camp,
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:28.420]   I am now in this Bible teaching church, is that enough?
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.340]   No.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:33.340]   The power of the gospel is so powerful,
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.780]   it causes an individual who was once
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:38.800]   living according to the flesh, once living in slavery,
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.420]   once living in abject ignorance,
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.620]   to become a new creation in Christ.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.820]   One who was living in anger, one who was living
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:50.080]   in fits of rage, in all the deeds of the flesh,
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.860]   to one who is going to be living in the newness of Christ.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.460]   Anything short of that, you know,
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:01.380]   is not according to the rule, it doesn't measure up.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.840]   So I want you guys to think about that
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.400]   by way of review over the whole book.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.380]   Chapter four, chapter six, if I can actually summarize
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:12.440]   the book in a smaller segment, it would be
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.760]   a nonstop contrast to help you see the difference, right?
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.220]   It was like a, hey, do you know what it actually means
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:25.100]   for you to think that you can abide in this good, holy law?
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:28.780]   Slavery, utter slavery, you can't do it, right?
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.180]   And it was trying to show us, this is the way of the law
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.740]   and this is the way of the Spirit.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.940]   This is freedom, this is bondage.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:38.620]   Do you know the difference?
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.180]   That was the question.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:44.040]   Do you guys remember this sloppy little comparison
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.580]   that I put up many weeks ago?
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.300]   You don't have to write all this down
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.780]   because I know you know it, you guys memorized it
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.660]   weeks ago, right?
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:58.060]   This was trying to show us there has been from long ago,
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:03.060]   ages ago, the way of the flesh, the way of the law,
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:06.740]   the way of man's own decisions, our own solutions,
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.500]   our own resources, and our own timetable.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.340]   And he gave example after example and one particularly
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:17.700]   he talked about, back there was the free woman, Sarah,
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.260]   and the bond slave, right?
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.460]   But all of that to us was very convicting
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.740]   because we knew in ourselves there is a huge difference
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.340]   operating and trusting God versus making my own
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:34.340]   silly, miniature, small, fruitless, empty solutions.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.880]   But can you tell the difference?
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.660]   Can you tell the difference when a false teacher
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.700]   comes to you and say, you gotta be about this new movement
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.100]   of secret friendly, this and this, and this is how
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.120]   you really make the church go, and you're saying,
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.200]   really?
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.540]   All we need to do is have lights?
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.400]   All we need to do is have a handsome man
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.740]   preaching short sermons?
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.940]   Where is Christ?
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:58.660]   This is how we're gonna solve the woes of the society.
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.740]   Is there this and that?
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.460]   All we need to do is be about justice and this?
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:05.180]   Can you tell the difference with all the movements
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.060]   and all the false teachers that exist today,
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.020]   what is of the flesh and solutions of man
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.320]   versus what actually necessitates Christ?
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.100]   And I think one of the strongest convictions
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:21.060]   as we review Galatians was if there is anything,
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.580]   anything that takes away from the sufficiency
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:27.720]   and the dire necessity of Christ, that's not faith.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.440]   That's not gospel.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:34.580]   Another example, if even in your own personal life
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.980]   you are struggling with mental health,
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.420]   you're struggling with behavior,
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.500]   you're struggling with this and that,
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.420]   I'm not gonna stand here and say,
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.660]   oh my goodness, all of that is just X, Y, and Z
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.660]   of darkness and demons and the devil, okay?
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.440]   But what I'm gonna say is,
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.700]   so what solutions are you looking for?
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:57.980]   Are you looking for miniature, small, fruitless,
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.060]   empty-vein promises?
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.020]   Or are you looking for greater faith, sanctification,
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.740]   and a newness in Christ?
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:09.260]   That's something I think is such a challenge
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:12.660]   and summary of what the book has been trying to show us,
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:13.660]   right?
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:16.940]   Do you feel like that you simply
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:19.420]   will have such a better life,
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.140]   that you will be secure if only you belong
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.680]   to a certain community?
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.420]   If you weren't oh so lonely?
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:26.860]   If you weren't da-da-da-da-da
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.460]   and you had better job, better this and better that?
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.140]   You have to know the difference.
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.720]   What is the fleshly solution
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.580]   and what is necessity of Christ, amen?
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:41.180]   Okay, then in the next, staring at verse 16,
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.600]   so we're looking at the rule.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.540]   The rule is new creation in Christ, this is the rule.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:49.420]   The freedom comes from being in the spirit,
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.960]   walking by the spirit, and it has to be the spirit
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.900]   because it's by faith, and it's by faith because of Christ.
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.660]   Christ is all, and therefore, that's the rule,
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.220]   that Christ is all.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.500]   Now, in looking at this then, he says,
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.140]   in summary, peace and mercy be upon those then
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.660]   who understand this, that who understands
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:13.500]   looking at Christ is freedom.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.740]   Now, on a just brief question,
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:18.260]   we have to ask the question also
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:23.160]   of what peace and what mercy is he talking about, okay?
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.700]   Now, we know that this book in the latter chapters
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.500]   has been talking about application
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.620]   that we need to walk in the spirit,
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.160]   and by walking in the spirit,
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.820]   we're gonna bear the fruits of the spirit, right?
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.220]   So, one of the repeat themes that we hit week after week
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:43.220]   was this idea that we are going to reap
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.580]   the fruit of the spirit, and here and now,
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.760]   the focus is going to be the peace of God
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.420]   and the mercy of God.
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.180]   As you recall, in Galatians 5,
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.500]   it says the fruit of the spirit is love,
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.480]   is joy, is peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.740]   faithfulness, gentleness, self-control,
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:02.540]   against such thing there is no law.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:07.540]   Question, do you as a Christian genuinely value, okay,
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:13.220]   the treasure of your sanctification and maturity
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:17.220]   more than anything else, okay?
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.820]   And you would have to put that as like,
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.340]   huh, I've never thought about it this way.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.160]   Some of you guys are in grad school,
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.060]   you've paid tons of money, okay,
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.560]   went into the red to get this degree.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.560]   Do you value the treasure of your own spiritual maturity,
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.260]   your heart condition of I know how to be content,
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.520]   I know how to have peace, I know how to go through struggle.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.120]   Do you value the growth of your mind, your faith,
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.100]   so much that that is worth more
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.420]   than any degree you could ever earn?
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:55.840]   Well, scripture says, you know, your sanctification,
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.180]   your spiritual growth is so valuable,
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.220]   it's worth more than any amount of gold.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.860]   Look at 1 Peter chapter one.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.500]   It's so valuable, bring on all the suffering,
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.180]   because if that produces the treasure and gold
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.740]   of your sanctification, amen.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.380]   It has proved to be worthwhile.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.860]   That's the perspective of the Christian.
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.140]   And this book in Galatians,
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.980]   so far in this applicational section,
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:23.940]   has been all about these fruits must be evident in you,
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:27.880]   and primarily these, peace and the mercies of God.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.260]   Remember in Philippians, it says,
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.960]   rejoice in the Lord always.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.200]   Again, I say, rejoice.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.840]   Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   The Lord is near, be anxious for nothing,
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.440]   but in everything by prayer and supplication.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.640]   With thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.180]   And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension,
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:52.180]   will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.140]   How valuable is that?
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.820]   To be able to have joy in all situations,
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.940]   and to be able to have a resource
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:03.640]   where we can take all our anxiety at the foot of the cross.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.060]   And so he says in verse 12,
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:08.420]   I know how to get along with humble means.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.920]   I also know how to live in prosperity.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.020]   In any and every circumstance,
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:16.080]   I have learned the secret of being fulfilled.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.520]   Going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:25.880]   May this be the treasure that is blessed for the Christian.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:33.480]   When we are parents, we want our kids to have all things.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.500]   We want them to have good education,
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.200]   we want to have physical health,
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.740]   and sometimes parents are most worried
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:43.320]   about their kids having good friends.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.120]   So much so, I'm guessing,
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.100]   that some of your parents went overboard, right?
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:50.320]   Overboard, and started asking kids,
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.360]   like, can you be friends with my son?
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.840]   Can you be friends with my daughter?
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.720]   And you're like, mom, what the heck?
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.400]   You can't artificially make them,
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.180]   force them to be my friends.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.340]   But the love of the parents do that, right?
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:05.560]   That is earthly love.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.940]   We don't fault that because we get it,
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.980]   but it's just so earthly.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:13.940]   If you think about, if you think about Galatians,
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.560]   it's interesting because the major problem
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.720]   that is facing this church
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.200]   is a temptation to compromise the gospel, why?
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.720]   Because they thought they were gonna be ostracized.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.500]   They weren't gonna be accepted.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.600]   They weren't gonna be holy people.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.780]   It's really interesting, right?
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.600]   But may it be our ambition,
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.040]   just like Apostle Paul's ambition,
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.500]   that the greatest blessing would not be
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.440]   that we, or our brothers and sisters,
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.200]   or even our children,
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.520]   be blessed simply with acceptance from the world,
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.400]   but rather, they would know this secret, amen?
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.560]   Next.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.880]   In verse 16, there is this interesting portion
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.880]   where it says, be upon them,
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.760]   and be upon the Israel of God.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.800]   Now, initially, I was gonna just say like a statement
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.400]   on this, but I was very curious.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.180]   So please, as I ask you,
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:13.840]   let's do audience participation, okay?
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:17.120]   Who is the Israel of God?
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.200]   I'm not gonna call on anyone specifically,
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.920]   'cause that'd be kinda messed up,
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.240]   to be like, give us your answer, right?
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.400]   But let's take a vote.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.320]   Cast your vote, okay?
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.920]   I want you guys to raise your hands.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.540]   Oh, I just realized my numbering's off,
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.800]   because that was another one that I erased.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.120]   Anyway. (laughs)
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.240]   Number one, okay?
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.320]   Does the Israel of God mean all believers,
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.060]   Jews and Gentiles, meaning the New Testament church,
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:47.140]   or does it mean the elect specifically,
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:50.180]   the descendants of Abraham physically,
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.940]   elect Israelites who will be saved?
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:56.180]   Those who think it's number one, raise your hand.
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:58.420]   Okay, okay.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:18:59.940]   There's a good number of you.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:03.460]   Those who think it's number three, raise your hand.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.300]   Okay, okay.
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:07.420]   And then a bunch of you did not heed my request,
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.780]   and you did not participate, okay?
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.100]   Okay, actually, if you saw the hands,
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.420]   there was a good amount of people who thought it was one,
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:17.460]   and a good amount of people who thought it was three.
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:21.300]   I am going to take five minutes to talk about this,
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:23.340]   because in the book of Galatians,
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:24.700]   this is like an interpretive point,
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:29.700]   but also, this particular passage, chapter six, verse 16,
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.180]   is used by those who believe number one
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.900]   as a primary passage,
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.280]   meaning it's one of the most common passages
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.020]   that they point to, saying, see?
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.300]   We are the new Israel, we're spiritual Israel, okay?
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.940]   However, whenever you're taking a look
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:46.720]   at interpretive struggles, you want to look at, first,
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.840]   the specific passage itself.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:53.360]   You do analysis of the immediate text, okay?
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.940]   So we take a look at this, and we ask this question.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:00.940]   So clearly, here, sorry,
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:07.860]   we have those who take this rule and walk by it,
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.840]   as many as, okay?
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.280]   So who is it referring to?
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.440]   If we're talking as many people who would do this,
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:17.160]   believe on Christ as the only way to be a new creation,
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.040]   to be sanctified, which is the promise of the gospel.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:25.040]   We're then talking about probably Gentiles, anybody, right?
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:30.480]   These, okay, them, may peace and mercy be upon them,
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:34.160]   and on the Israel of God, okay?
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.240]   So you have this Greek term, and,
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.480]   which is just a conjunction, and then the Israel of God.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.900]   My point being, would be, my argument to you
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:45.360]   on the analysis of this text,
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.140]   that the and actually creates a distinction, not a unity.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:54.640]   The and puts two categorical references,
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.680]   and then says, here they are,
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:01.200]   which means that there are as many as, and Israel,
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.240]   which means there are two separate people.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.320]   Does that make sense?
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.080]   Just like, as an example, if I say,
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:10.000]   Mark and Bia are blessed as one in marriage,
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.280]   you would never say that Bia is the new Mark.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:17.920]   Yes, even though she is my better half, and all of that,
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.560]   and yes, spiritually we are one, because before God we are,
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:25.280]   and yes, we are joined together in an unbreakable covenant,
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.240]   we are still two distinct people, yes?
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:31.720]   So I think the immediate text actually shows us otherwise,
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.840]   otherwise it would be very redundant.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.600]   If I say, as many as, okay,
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.080]   meaning both Jews and Greeks, I mean, Jews and Gentiles,
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.800]   and also the Jews, that would be redundant
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.180]   in a weird way of saying it.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:49.360]   The other way that you would expect it to be read is,
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:54.160]   as many as, right, namely, Israel,
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.540]   or you wouldn't even see a conjunction,
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:00.740]   you would just have like a parenthetical statement, okay?
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:02.520]   Now, the reason why I bring this up,
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.200]   because in the book of Galatians,
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:07.120]   it's always good to take a look at the letter,
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.520]   the whole book, right?
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.800]   Not just one passage, but the whole letter.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.560]   It says a lot about this whole idea
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.640]   of is the New Testament church Israel?
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.920]   Abraham, while being physically the father of the Israelites
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.620]   is genuinely spiritually the father of those who believe,
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:26.480]   is a statement found in Galatians, namely here.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.520]   Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.120]   who are sons of Abraham.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.120]   100% agree, why?
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.720]   Because it's the Bible.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.940]   I believe if you are of faith,
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:41.040]   you are in the line of Abraham, why?
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.520]   Because the scripture said
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.680]   that God would justify the Gentiles by faith
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:48.640]   and preach the gospel beforehand to Abraham,
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.460]   saying all the nations will be blessed in you,
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.080]   so then those who are of faith
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:56.160]   are blessed with Abraham, the believer, right?
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.300]   And the scripture tried to show us
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:01.400]   that Abraham actually, before he was even circumcised,
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.680]   was already accredited because of his faith,
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.380]   and therefore, if you're of faith, you are in his line, yes?
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.540]   The other passage in Galatians chapter three said,
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:14.140]   for you are all sons of God through faith in Jesus Christ,
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.180]   and therefore, verse 29, if you belong to Christ,
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.420]   then you are Abraham's descendants,
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.860]   heirs according to promise, 100% agree.
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.940]   You have the blessing, you have the heir,
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.220]   like sonship, you have therefore the promises.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:36.040]   Those are all yours without any doubt or hindrance.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.340]   Praise the Lord for the gospel.
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:41.960]   Other parts of scripture, now what we do is a systematic.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.100]   Do other parts of scripture agree with this?
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:45.220]   Yes.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.360]   In Romans chapter two, it tells us he is not a Jew
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.060]   who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision,
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:53.100]   which is one outward in the flesh,
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:56.640]   but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, yes?
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.060]   What is he saying?
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:00.220]   That not all physical descendants of Abraham
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.160]   are spiritual descendants, why?
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.620]   Because you have to have faith, right?
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:09.140]   There is no individual who's gonna be a descendant
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.660]   who does not have faith, okay?
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:14.500]   But here then is the big question.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.700]   This is the way that the question will phrase itself
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.300]   or how the argument will set up.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:24.300]   Since we are spiritual children of Abraham by faith,
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:27.480]   and two, not all physical descendants of Abraham
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.420]   are actually spiritual descendants of Abraham,
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:33.960]   then is the New Testament church the new Israel, okay?
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.160]   And the answer is no, you went too far.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.560]   You drove way too far with it, okay?
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.000]   It's too far for you to say that therefore
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.640]   the church absorbed or fulfilled or superseded
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.520]   or replaced Israel.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.020]   To make that argument is to follow this diagram.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:55.040]   The blue circle is all of Israel, okay?
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.340]   Clearly, they're not all saved.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.520]   But within Israel, there is a remnant
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.800]   who will believe upon the gospel.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.600]   These little dots represent the nations.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.300]   Gentiles just means ethnic.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.700]   They're different people groups.
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.920]   They come into the big house, the church,
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.760]   which is now the New Testament entity.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.980]   This, therefore, here is the new Israel, okay?
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.320]   But that's not the case.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.440]   We have not proven, there's so many things
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.040]   that we did not prove.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.440]   We did not prove that God has spiritualized
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.600]   all of his physical promises to the nation of Israel.
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.080]   He had promise of blessing.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.280]   He gave them promise that they'd be a great nation.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.560]   He promised them land.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.580]   He promised them that they would have a leadership role
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.300]   in the kingdom of God.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.280]   Are all of these things realized?
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.360]   Or were they simply absorbed in the church
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.480]   since the church is a new Israel?
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.100]   None of those passages prove any of that.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:57.080]   There are 73 references to Israel in the New Testament.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.160]   None of them call the church the new spiritual Israel.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.560]   We did not prove that God absorbed Israel
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.700]   into the general body of believers,
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.360]   or we did not prove that God has no other plans
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.080]   for that particular nation in the future.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.920]   We proved none of that.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.940]   Why does this matter?
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.800]   Why am I taking time to do this?
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.440]   It's in line, it's in line
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.080]   with the nature of the book of Galatians,
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   which is we have to have such a gratitude
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:31.640]   of the greatness and the grandeur of the mystery.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:36.840]   God gave specific promises to a chosen people,
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:40.440]   and he allowed you and I, who are far off,
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.920]   to come get blessed, right?
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.120]   Ephesians chapter two says,
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.480]   you know, you had no commonwealth of Israel,
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.800]   you had no God, you had no hope, yes?
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.840]   You had nothing.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.760]   But we were able to receive the blessings,
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.160]   we were able to receive the promises of the inheritance,
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.560]   and you were brought near
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.760]   because the incredible gospel message
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.520]   that you too can be adopted into the household of God.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.420]   But it would be strange, it would be too far
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:11.560]   for the adopted child to look at the natural born,
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.200]   firstborn, and say, you know what?
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.680]   I'm actually the firstborn.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.920]   I'm natural and you are not.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.520]   That would be strange, yes?
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.520]   And the reason why this matters
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.400]   is because this question was actually addressed
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.340]   in other parts of scripture.
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:28.520]   Now, I'm gonna read to you a last couple of verses,
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.360]   and then I'll summarize that point.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.760]   In Romans chapter 11, after Apostle Paul
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.120]   makes this long argument
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.320]   that salvation is by the sovereign choice of God
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.180]   because it's by mercy, right?
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:47.400]   Then he starts to describe how the Israelites he rejected,
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.520]   the Israelites rejected God.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.800]   He says, I stuck out my hand all day long
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:52.820]   to an obstinate people.
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.480]   They're the ones who rejected me.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.560]   And there's this question.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.920]   So then, God has not rejected his people, has he?
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.400]   Who is he talking about?
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.560]   Physical Israel.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.400]   May it never be, for I too am an Israelite,
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.320]   a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.160]   He's talking about his biological, physical lineage.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.760]   Number two, or verse two.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.780]   God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:18.860]   Or do you not know what the scripture says
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.740]   in the passage about Elijah,
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.780]   how he pleads with God against Israel.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:25.680]   Lord, they have killed your prophets.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.940]   They have torn down your altars, and I alone am left.
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.940]   And they are seeking my life.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:33.860]   But what is the divine response?
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.500]   I have kept for myself 7,000 men
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.580]   who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.500]   In the same way, then, there has also come
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.180]   to be at the present time, a remnant,
[01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:47.980]   according to God's gracious choice.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.660]   Following down just a little bit longer
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:52.580]   into Romans chapter 11, verse 17.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.660]   Okay, Romans chapter 11, 17.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.700]   This is what he says.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:59.460]   But if some of the branches were then broken off,
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:03.800]   and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them,
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.700]   and became partaker with them
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:08.180]   of the rich root of the olive tree,
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:12.020]   do not be arrogant toward the branches.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.100]   But if you are arrogant,
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.620]   remember that it is not you who supports the root.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:17.940]   The root supports you.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.800]   You guys follow along what he's saying, right?
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:24.660]   You are a wild branch from another tree
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:27.780]   who has been grafted into the main tree.
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:31.780]   And if you all of a sudden think we are the main stem,
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.940]   you're actually being arrogant.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:35.420]   Verse 19.
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.340]   You will say, then, branches were broken off
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:39.260]   so that I might be grafted in?
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.460]   Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief,
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.620]   but you stand by your faith.
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:47.000]   Do not be conceited, but fear,
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.580]   for if God did not spare the natural branches,
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:51.820]   he will not spare you either.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:56.240]   Behold, then, the kindness and severity of God,
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:00.040]   to those who fell severity, but to you, God's kindness.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.580]   If you continue in his kindness,
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:04.140]   otherwise, you will also be cut off.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:06.900]   Verse 27.
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:08.620]   This is my covenant with them.
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.860]   When I take away their sin.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.260]   From the standpoint of the gospel,
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:14.220]   there are enemies for your sake,
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.420]   but from the standpoint of God's choice,
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:19.460]   they are beloved for the sake of the fathers.
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:24.460]   For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.660]   Who is he thinking about?
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:30.420]   The fathers to whom he has made promise.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:33.780]   So the promises of nation, the promises of land,
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:37.100]   the promises of a role within God's kingdom,
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.780]   he actually has those in mind.
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:39.620]   Why?
[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.820]   God doesn't have to spiritualize anything.
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:42.660]   Why?
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:44.540]   Because he will actually keep them.
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:45.660]   Verse 30.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:48.700]   For just as you were once disobedient to God,
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.340]   but now have been shown mercy
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.260]   because of their disobedience,
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:54.700]   so these also now have been disobedient,
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.940]   that because of the mercy shown to you,
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:59.380]   they also may now be shown mercy,
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:02.180]   for God has shut up all in disobedience,
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:05.780]   so that he may show mercy to all.
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:07.460]   Earlier I said this matters.
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:08.460]   Why?
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.860]   Because there's supposed to be in our hearts,
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:12.500]   particularly as Gentiles,
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:16.140]   an incredible, like, mind-blowing, say what?
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:21.660]   Here is this tree which is symbolic of the nation of Israel.
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.020]   To them are the blessing.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:24.420]   To them are the inheritance.
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.700]   To them is the promise.
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:28.220]   And we get to be grafted into them.
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:31.100]   That's the humble posture of appreciation
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:32.780]   for adopted children.
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:34.660]   It should look like this.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.620]   We had earlier the arrow pointing the other way.
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:42.100]   They need to come into this new entity.
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.020]   But scripture actually says,
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.620]   "No, no, no, you don't understand.
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.540]   "You get to be a part of their plan."
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.060]   Does that make sense?
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.540]   The arrow goes reverse.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.100]   And so that's why the scripture said in Ephesians,
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:58.220]   "This is an incredible mystery of God."
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:02.980]   That the Gentiles could approach God.
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:05.980]   The Gentiles could actually have God through Christ,
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:09.980]   a relationship, where yes, just like a son,
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.140]   I could go to my father.
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:14.380]   I could look forward to the promises
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.300]   that I would have fulfillment in everything in Christ.
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:18.860]   That is a true, true blessing.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.020]   And so with that said,
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:24.100]   I wanted to just highlight that
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:28.420]   because if you think about the book of Galatians
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:30.180]   in grand summary,
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:33.460]   he was trying to show us just what a treasure
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:36.620]   our salvation is in Christ.
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:41.620]   That no other temptation of glory, good showing,
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.260]   of approval of man or anything,
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:47.140]   even the world, could have any sway on us, amen?
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.020]   And so that being the case,
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:51.060]   I wanna wrap up with verse 17.
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.940]   Sorry, that was a long detour, okay?
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:59.140]   In verse 17, he makes this statement,
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:04.060]   "From now on then, let no one cause trouble for me,
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:08.620]   "for I bear on my body the brand marks of Jesus."
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.660]   I have a question for you.
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:11.580]   How did you take that?
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:13.780]   What is he actually saying, right?
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:17.060]   "From now on, let no one cause me trouble."
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:18.940]   How did you picture him saying that?
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:20.900]   I will be honest, this is the way I read it.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:24.700]   "Don't mess with me, I'm crazy, you see?"
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:28.500]   And he's just like showing them his scars, right?
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.740]   It kinda sounds like don't mess with me, right?
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:33.100]   You don't wanna know how serious I am.
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:36.580]   Now, in some sense, he could say that.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:40.420]   I mean, Apostle Paul was so gung-ho.
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:43.300]   Apostle Paul is the apostle, you know?
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:46.460]   Planter of churches, missionary to afar.
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:48.180]   And in some sense, he has every right to be like,
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:50.380]   "You know what, all you guys, you guys need to be quiet.
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:52.540]   "I'm done talking about this."
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.020]   And in some sense, in other parts of scripture,
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:57.300]   he actually commands, "You know what?
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.740]   "If anybody is teaching a different gospel,
[01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:02.340]   "make sure they stay quiet."
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:04.700]   And any defiance of teaching is so bad for the community,
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.980]   it's like gangrene, rebuke them harshly,
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.020]   and the second time they do it, kick 'em out, right?
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.360]   So is that the message?
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:15.740]   I think another way to look at it is
[01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:19.140]   because he particularly, or I guess specifically says
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:22.820]   that he, right, "I don't want you to trouble me,"
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:27.340]   for, "because I have the brand marks of Christ,"
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:30.060]   he is actually saying something a little different.
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.780]   Close, but a little different.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:37.220]   The emphatic point is, "I belong to Christ," right?
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.340]   The emphatic point is, "You can try.
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:42.020]   "Don't test me.
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.540]   "You already have, actually.
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:45.160]   "Look at my back.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.000]   "You've pushed me.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.900]   "You've tried to bend me.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.520]   "I don't belong to you or the world.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.140]   "I belong to Christ."
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:54.300]   Wow, what a challenge.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:57.300]   I pray that we would have the same kind of conviction
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:58.220]   where we can say with him,
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.720]   "I have been crucified with Christ.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.420]   "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.440]   "The life which I now live in the flesh,
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.500]   "I live by faith in the Son of God,
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:10.580]   "who loved me and gave himself up for me."
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:14.740]   This, he says, is his identity.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:19.160]   "I have been identified by the brand marks of Christ.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.860]   "I so belong to Christ.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:27.940]   "I so belong to the Lord that I bear his branding."
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:30.460]   That's an amazing statement.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:33.900]   And again, I go back to this idea.
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:36.840]   How many times throughout our study did we talk about,
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.800]   "Hey, do you guys struggle with the fear of man?"
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.000]   You remember back when we started talking
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.720]   about Apostle Peter and how he succumbed to the pressure
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.600]   and he's like, "Yeah, maybe we don't eat with them."
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.500]   He started withdrawing.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:52.040]   And then we think about the pressures of the people,
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.980]   how he would say those false teachers,
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:55.640]   they just like making a good showing,
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.000]   so what are they concerned with?
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.120]   The eyes of the people.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.400]   But Apostle Paul, remember, way at the beginning
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.440]   in chapter one, verse 10, he said,
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.400]   "Am I now trying to be pleasing in the eyes of men
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.700]   "or of God?
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.160]   "If I were trying to be pleasing to men,
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:12.120]   "I would not be a servant of Christ."
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.600]   Wow.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.840]   I pray that this book was challenging to you.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:21.960]   In however you want to present yourself to the world,
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:24.000]   in however you want to be accepted at school,
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.120]   at work, and in your family, and even at church,
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:30.480]   I pray we would be so bold.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.320]   My identity is in Christ.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.960]   And let that be the power that we live by every day.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:36.840]   Amen?
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.840]   Let's pray together.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.560]   Heavenly Father, Lord God, actually, if we feared you more,
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:50.560]   but what's another way to put it, God,
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.980]   if we just loved you so much,
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.940]   and if we experienced the satisfaction
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.480]   of being in Christ in such a way,
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.480]   God, we know the secret of being content
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:02.920]   in every single situation.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.480]   Lord, there would be a lot of drama
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:06.920]   and a lot of pain we could avoid.
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:11.920]   In this letter, they're receiving so much harsh rebuke,
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:16.440]   a tone of urgency, and in many ways, a shaking up,
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.440]   because, God, they succumb to the pressures
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.200]   of wanting to belong to a certain sect
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.280]   of self-righteous people.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.960]   I pray, Father God, that we would be humble enough to know
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.440]   we are all susceptible to that.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.640]   And then, God, in humility, help us
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.640]   just to pursue Christ with everything we have.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.800]   I ask that, God, we would voluntarily
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:41.140]   and we would readily be identified with Christ,
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.480]   whatever consequences it may mean.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.520]   And in that way, Lord, I pray that our church
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:47.680]   would be pleasing in your sight.
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.600]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:54.440]   Listen, because we hit upon a couple different things,
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.520]   I am gonna take just like two, three minutes of questions.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.720]   Do you guys have any questions
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:01.020]   about the stuff we covered today,
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:05.600]   including the, you know, are we the New Testament Israel,
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.200]   or things like that?
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.420]   The passage in the Book of Galatians
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:14.080]   that was difficult for you guys?
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:21.400]   Please know that, yes.
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:27.260]   Go ahead, just yell it out, I'll hear you.
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:30.260]   (faintly speaking)
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:31.260]  , yeah.
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:34.180]   (faintly speaking)
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:02.020]   Yeah, so do you guys hear the question?
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.660]   Back in the portion where it was giving us
[01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:08.700]   the trail of thought, we have like freedom,
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:12.040]   there's Hagar, there's et cetera, and then he mentions,
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.180]   but if you think about it,
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:16.540]   like you follow the context of that line he was saying,
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:19.580]   there is a physical Jerusalem, right?
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:21.980]   But also there's like physical Mount Sinai,
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:23.920]   physical da-da-da-da-da.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:27.460]   And if an individual, that line is talking about,
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.420]   there are people who believe, like having, right?
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:32.780]   Like physical blessings,
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.860]   there are people who believe in solutions of,
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:37.340]   if I take a trip to the Mecca, you know?
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.740]   It'd be very similar to seeking earthly blessings
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.380]   and finding earthly security
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:44.900]   because you have earthly things.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:46.060]   And he's trying to make the point,
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.740]   you're free from all that.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:50.540]   There is a heavenly mindedness, a spiritual mindedness,
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.440]   right?
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:54.100]   So the point that I'm making is,
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.900]   if you want to use that argument to, let's say,
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:01.900]   draw an analogy to why the New Testament church is Israel,
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:04.660]   there's like a need for a greater line
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:07.900]   because those two thoughts are actually quite separate,
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:08.740]   right?
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.100]   The point that he's making
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:13.820]   versus the question of our identity,
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.680]   they're two separate lines.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:16.780]   Does that make sense?
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:20.980]   Okay, we could talk after.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:22.720]   Okay, cool.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:25.440]   Well, you know, how about we do it this way?
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.040]   If you guys have questions and stuff like that,
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.060]   please feel free to ask.
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:33.060]   That's kind of a quite long running question and debate,
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.860]   right?
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.740]   And in some sense, in my mind, it's very simple, right?
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:43.560]   We get to receive the blessings.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.240]   Amazing, right?
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:48.360]   God fulfills all of his promises to them.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.520]   Amazing.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:50.460]   That's it.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.400]   But the questions,
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.060]   because we're trying to reconcile so much of scripture,
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:57.480]   I understand there's room for debate there.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.780]   Please know that our doors are open to you, okay?
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:02.680]   Well, I'll turn it over to Pastor Peter for announcements.
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:14.000]   Can we thank Pastor Mark for leading us this?
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.160]   [audience applauding]
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.560]   It takes a lot to prepare just for the Bible study,
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.900]   so when you guys get a chance,
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:30.180]   please say thank you to Pastor Mark
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:33.320]   for leading us through the latter three chapters.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:35.580]   This is our final Bible study,
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:38.560]   so I do have a few announcements to make,
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.940]   and then just a couple reminders, okay?
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:45.580]   The FAM245 Barbecue is this Saturday,
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.460]   so if you guys have been married three years and under,
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:49.240]   that's for you.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.620]   The Women's Softball, the fellowship is on Sunday,
[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:54.200]   but there's been a change.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.380]   It isn't at T. Winkle Park.
[01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:01.340]   It's at Steve Ambrese Park in Orange,
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:03.700]   so if you guys, if you're a lady
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.900]   and you already were planning to do softball,
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:07.100]   you guys should already know this.
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:11.860]   If not, just go on our app and then find the contact people,
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.940]   and then they'll let you know.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:17.340]   Next week, we aren't meeting on Wednesday for Bible study,
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:20.020]   but we are gonna meet for praise and prayer,
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:23.220]   and the praise and prayers weren't just
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.940]   for like a break from the Bible study.
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:28.900]   It was actually a time where we get together, really,
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:32.440]   to pray corporately for things,
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.500]   so it's just as important as the Bible study, right?
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.420]   And this year's theme is pray in the spirit,
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:42.180]   and so not just for the summer, but going forward,
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:45.780]   if there's a praise and prayer, please do prioritize that,
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.440]   'cause that's the only time that we really get together
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:51.740]   on a monthly basis just to lift up the needs of the church.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.900]   (silence)
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.060]   (silence)
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.220]   (silence)
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:00.380]   (silence)
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:02.540]   (silence)
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:04.700]   (silence)
