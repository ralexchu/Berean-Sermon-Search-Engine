[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.160]   Hi, I'm Joni, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.520]   Growing up in the church, I said yes in accepting Christ as my Savior when my dad asked me in
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.560]   elementary school, but there was no true repentance and knowledge of God.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.960]   I did my devotion worksheets, memorized verses, served in ministries, and went on mission
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.040]   trips, but I was caught up in Christian culture.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.560]   I knew all the right answers and all the external things a Christian should do, but I did not
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.880]   have the right heart and intention in rendering my life as a living sacrifice to God.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.280]   And since I grew up in the same church, I had the same core group of friends for over
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.360]   a decade, until my family moved and started attending a different church.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.960]   I started to not want to attend fellowship or Sunday service.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.160]   It was here when I realized that I'd only gone to church because of friends and not
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.640]   because of a desire to worship God.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.760]   However, in my senior year of high school, my family still commuted to my former church,
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.760]   and it was in this year that I got baptized, but I continued to view church and the Christian
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.880]   life as a Sunday activity.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.520]   Fast forward to my first year in UCI.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.280]   I wanted to find a local church that taught the Bible and consisted of believers who worshipped
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.200]   and loved God, and as one that finds comfort in the people she knows and doesn't like meeting
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.160]   new people, it is truly God's grace that I first had the desire to find a new local church
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.820]   that loved God, his word, and his people, and it's his grace that I attended Berrien.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.120]   So in my first small group in sophomore year, we read Holiness of God, and it was here that
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.600]   I came to understand that I was at the hands of a wrathful and holy God who sees my sin
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.480]   as utterly repulsive.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.840]   I did not deserve to be saved, as it is written, "There is none righteous, not even one," in
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480]   Romans 3:10.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.200]   My sin is cosmic treason against him, and I deserve his wrath.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.400]   And then I saw the beauty of the gospel.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.560]   The almighty God sent his son, Jesus Christ, to save this world, making a way for sinners
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.240]   like myself to be reconciled to him.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.520]   No amount of works or biblical knowledge could make me worthy or better.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.600]   Only faith in Christ's death and resurrection and turning away from my former life could
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.540]   allow me to have a relationship with God.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.260]   From here, there was a difference in my heart because I sought to live for the Lord and
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.720]   die to myself.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.520]   I began to do my spiritual disciplines in wanting to know him more.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.440]   I loved those around me and sought to love others because of God's love, as it says in
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.860]   1 John 4:19, "We love because he first loved us."
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.120]   My heart's shift in not seeking validation from man, career, or success, but living for
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.400]   the Lord aligned with Paul's heart in Philippians 3, 8-9, when he says, "More than that, I count
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.280]   whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish so that I may gain
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.360]   Christ."
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.400]   So I'm getting baptized today because I don't think I truly repented for my sins before
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.520]   I got baptized in high school.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.740]   My younger self did not deny herself, take up her cross, and follow him as Christ commands
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.320]   in Matthew 16-24.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.000]   She did not see her depravity, her need for the Savior, nor submit to him.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.880]   But this conclusion was three years in the making because I was scared to talk in front
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.360]   of people and prideful and not wanting to admit that I was peer-pressured into getting
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.520]   baptized and that I'm a newer Christian.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   It was when I was asked recently if I was baptized after I became a Christian that God
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.280]   pressed into me what the meaning of baptism is and that I have been buried with him through
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.560]   baptism into death so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.480]   so we too might walk in newness of life, Romans 6-4.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.080]   Since my life hadn't reflected one who died to sin, it meant that my previous baptism
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.080]   was done in vain and avoiding believer's baptism would mean disobedience.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.400]   So as I wrestled about this throughout these past months, God humbled me and reminded me
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.960]   of his grace in reconciling me to himself and that he is my king.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.560]   Getting baptized now doesn't nullify my justification three years ago, but I want to be baptized
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.920]   to be obedient to my heavenly Father, that I praise him for saving me, continually working
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.180]   in me, and that my testimony glorifies him.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.680]   For he rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.880]   son, Colossians 1-13.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.560]   And it is here that I love and proclaim him as my Lord and Savior and that I have been
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.880]   Thank you.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.320]   [APPLAUSE]
