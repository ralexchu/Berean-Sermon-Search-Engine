[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.420]   We ask that you would search our hearts and the things that we've gleaned and shared already
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.800]   would make a deeper impression in our hearts, Lord God, to understand your grace and the
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.660]   people that you have chosen to bring the gospel to us.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.660]   We pray for your blessing.
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.920]   We pray for soberness.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.200]   Help us, Lord God, to be physically awake, to be able to listen and to digest the things
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.200]   that we have studied.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200]   Amen.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   All right.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.840]   So, we're looking at the last passage for the book of Colossians.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.560]   Next week is our overview study.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.760]   So, I have questions on the bottom, which I'm going to review with you before I finish.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.060]   So next week, just kind of, you know, just follow the directions and try to answer as
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.360]   much of these as you can on the bottom.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.000]   But today we're going to be finishing up the book of Colossians.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.560]   It's probably weird that we're taking a whole Bible study that's just to study the last
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.080]   three verses or three, four verses just filled with names.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.080]   But again, typically when we go through these names, we don't really dig too deep because
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.220]   you just think, well, just Paul's saying bye.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.040]   But these names are on there for a purpose, right?
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.740]   And so the reason why we're taking, you know, taking some time to go through these names
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.700]   by step by step is because we see what the early church was like when you see the testimonies
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.580]   of these people.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.880]   And so these are things that typically that when you mention Titchicus or Archippus or
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.000]   Nymphus, you know, you mentioned that, that that doesn't even come up in Bible trivia,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   right?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.520]   Most people don't know these names, but they are people's names on the Bible for a reason.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.880]   So today I broadly divided the section that we're looking at into two parts.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.440]   And the two main parts is insight that we gained from this, what the early church was
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   like.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   Okay.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.640]   And then the second part is the writing and spreading of the New Testament letters.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.060]   Okay.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.560]   Writing and spreading of the New Testament letters.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.920]   So we get some insight through this last part of Colossae, what the early church was like.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.160]   So the first thing, the church that he mentioned, the Laodicean church.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.440]   Again, we want to jump into it more specifically, but Laodicea is one of the churches that are
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.360]   mentioned in the seven churches in the book of Revelation, right?
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.000]   Well Colossae is the very next city right underneath that.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.680]   So the closest city to Laodicea is Colossae.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.440]   So Paul addresses the Laodicean brothers, but the Laodicean, if you remember, what was
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.680]   the Laodicean church known for?
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   Lukewarmness.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.040]   But what was the cause of the lukewarmness?
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.200]   Do you remember?
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.560]   Their riches, right?
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.020]   Because they said, you say you are rich and I have become wealthy.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.840]   And then, and then Jesus basically turns that around, but in actuality you're really poor
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   and wretched.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.800]   And he turns the table around and says, your self-reliance has actually made you dull to
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   him.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.260]   And then, so the indictment against them was lukewarmness.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.200]   So Laodicean church was considered a very wealthy church and Colossae was right underneath
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.000]   that, right?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.680]   And Colossae also was a very prominent city.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.120]   So again, the lot of activity was taking place right around that area.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   Do you remember?
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.120]   Right?
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.080]   What was the primary thing that was going on?
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.720]   What is that area called?
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   Something minor.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   Asia minor.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.320]   Asia minor, okay?
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.540]   So in Asia minor, there was a lot of activity.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.220]   There was a, what was the, one of the main things that was going on in this area that
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.780]   Paul, Apostle Paul was concerned about?
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.780]   What?
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.460]   Paul's teaching.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.820]   Anything in particular?
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.980]   The Judaizers.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.340]   The Judaizers were having a huge impact in this area.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.040]   And so Paul was very concerned about Laodicea, Galatia.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.340]   In fact, when he writes Galatia, he says the same thing, to make sure that you spread this
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.540]   letter that everybody reads it.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.540]   Okay?
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.380]   Nympha was probably a wealthy person.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.220]   Okay, let me...
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.420]   Okay, I forgot one.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.700]   The churches were usually a small in number and met in people's homes until the early
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.140]   third century, meaning they were house churches.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.320]   So even if they had big homes, they wouldn't have been able to fit hundreds of people.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.640]   So most churches that Paul is referring to is probably house churches that may have fit,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.080]   if it was big, maybe 20 people, right?
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.280]   And that would be considered a big house.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.280]   Most average homes at that time probably only could fit about 10 to 15, right?
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.960]   Kinda like the churches in India, if you go to the villages, they'll say, "We have three
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.720]   churches in this area," and they're probably only talking about 30 people, 10 in each home,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.720]   right?
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.000]   And so when the churches are written, most of these letters are written to a very small
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.440]   group of people, right?
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.640]   So again, it gives us insight into the early church.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.360]   What happened in third century that brought about the building of buildings?
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.320]   Early third century.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.080]   Anybody know what happens in third century?
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.680]   Constantine becomes the emperor, and then he supposedly becomes a Christian, and then
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.600]   he makes Christianity the state religion.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   So all of a sudden, they enjoyed peace for the first time.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.320]   So for 300 years, Christians couldn't get organized because they were constantly running
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.640]   for...
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.920]   From persecution, right?
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.540]   Part of the reason why there was this turnaround attitude toward Christian was because the
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:57.320]   persecution by a guy named, I think, Diocletian, okay, I'm butchering his name, but there was
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.620]   a guy who was before Constantine, the persecution was so intense that the non-Christians started
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.360]   to have sympathy for Christians.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.040]   And so it was right around that time, he said, "Man, we're really treating these people poorly."
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.460]   And then Constantine comes into power and actually rides this overwhelming sympathy
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.280]   toward Christians and says that he became a Christian and then allows freedom for Christianity.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.120]   And that's when the churches get organized, that's when the Catholic Church, as we know
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.240]   it, first gets organized.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.200]   First church assembly happens at that time, and then the church buildings start going
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   up.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.380]   And then if you look at church history, where all the divisions and the problems actually
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.080]   start coming in is around third century.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.400]   It's for the first time when they enjoyed peace, okay?
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:51.060]   So until then, most of the churches are meeting in people's homes in small, small numbers.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.540]   "Nympha," that he mentions here is probably a wealthy person because they were meeting
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.380]   at her or his home.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.660]   People don't know if it was, it's a he or her, okay?
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.700]   Some of the translations are different.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.140]   Though they were small in number, the churches seemed to have shared information and fellowship
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.340]   together early on.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.840]   So these letters were written, and again, these churches knew of each other, and there
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.920]   seems to have been interaction that was going on.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.400]   In other words, they were not isolated.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.760]   "Archippus," as another man mentioned, was called to fulfill his ministry and not to
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.940]   simply take the title.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.520]   Church tradition says that Archippus became the Bishop of Laodicea and eventually became
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.000]   a martyr for his faith.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.200]   So again, these are just names that are mentioned at the end of the letter, but these were very
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.160]   prominent, significant people in the first century.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.120]   So probably in the first and early second century, if you said Archippus, most of the
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.980]   people there probably would have known him.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.820]   Like today, if we said John Piper, right?
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.680]   And if you're in evangelical community, you would know his name.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:11.440]   Archippus was probably one of those people that they would have universally known.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.400]   The early church was not perfect.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.560]   Almost every New Testament letter addresses some issues that they had in the church.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.320]   What issue was mentioned in Colossae?
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:29.440]   He mentions it in chapter two.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:36.280]   Archippus' relationship with the Archippus was not perfect.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.040]   We already mentioned one, the Judaizers.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.980]   They had both problems, the Gnostics and the Judaizers.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.120]   So it was twofold in this church.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.560]   And so typically people say, "We need to have an early New Testament church," or people
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.120]   would oftentimes refer to Acts chapter two as the ideal church.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:04.320]   But if you look at the early church, almost every single church had problems.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.660]   You can understand why.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:11.640]   Even though the Holy Spirit was working and apostles were there, these are human beings.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.000]   These are people who used to hate each other, all of a sudden gathering together and worshipping.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.760]   So when the Holy Spirit wasn't prominent, in other words, if they were kind of lax or
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.480]   maybe spiritually not sober, their flesh would get in and then they would have problems.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.200]   And so that was one of the big problems in the early church.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.520]   So if you read any letter in the New Testament, I can't think of a single letter that doesn't
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.560]   address some problem.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.800]   So the fact that the early church was not perfect is universal.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.260]   The early church was organized.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.600]   It wasn't just a bunch of people saying, "We're two or three gathered together, there am I
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   in the midst."
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.520]   A lot of times you hear that in parachurches.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.560]   Organizations are not necessary.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.840]   Early church was very organized.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:03.640]   Archipest was called to fulfill his ministry because he was called to that purpose.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.800]   There was elders, there were deacons, there were qualifications, there were sacraments,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.920]   there were ways to deal with unruly people, how to deal with sin.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.520]   The church was very organized.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.560]   The Book of Corinthians talks about being orderly in the way that they were worshipping
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.960]   in the church.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.240]   So the church gathered together, but it wasn't just free for all, did whatever they wanted.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.120]   It was a very organized church.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.360]   This is the part that you probably may be a little bit more interested in.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:43.120]   You should be interested in all of it, but this is hopefully a bit more interesting.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   The letters.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.480]   How did we get the letters and how do we have confidence?
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.360]   Again, we're not going to be able to get into the inerrancy and how we got the letters and
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   all of it.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.200]   But we get a glimpse of how the early church gathered the letters and how it was passed
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.480]   down throughout the years.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.320]   The letters were written in small groups of people, but was immediately copied and circulated
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   to other churches.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.600]   Paul says here that make sure that you get this and then you share this letter with other
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.840]   churches.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.880]   So right off the bat, even though the letter was addressed to Colossae, there was an understanding
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.440]   that the content of this letter was meant to be applied universally.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.760]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.440]   It wasn't just a personal letter to Colossae, only dealing with Colossae, right off the
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440]   bat.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:34.240]   It came to them authoritative, not only to Colossae, but to all the churches.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.200]   Now why is this important?
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.940]   Because we have the letters.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:50.900]   It was meant right off the bat for them to be receiving it from the apostles from God.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.620]   Though the letters were written to specific churches, the content was meant to be consumed
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.620]   universally.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:03.020]   It was circulated to the churches and it was consumed universally.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.700]   The Bible was not accessible to most people, so they were dependent on letters being read
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.460]   out loud at the churches.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.540]   So again, if you go to India, many of the people are illiterate.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.580]   And so because of that, there's a lot of gatherings where there's a lot of singing and there's
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.100]   a lot of memorizing and a lot of teaching going on because they don't have Bibles for
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.100]   themselves.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.840]   They can't read it for themselves.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.740]   But on top of that, at this particular period of time, people did not have access to the
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.820]   scrolls themselves.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.780]   You'd have to be filthy rich or very high-powered person to have some kind of access to the
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.780]   scrolls.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:41.340]   And when Paul says to Timothy to devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, it was
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.420]   literal.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.940]   Literally stand and literally just read verse by verse.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.580]   Because that was the only way that they were able to consume the Bible.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:57.940]   And that was true in the early church, in this church.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.380]   Paul ends this letter by saying, "I signed this with my own hands to authenticate authority
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.380]   of this letter."
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.980]   And he says this in two other places.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.020]   In 1 Corinthians and in 2 Thessalonians 3.17.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.740]   Now why do you think he goes out of his way to authenticate this letter and these other
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.980]   two letters?
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.140]   Anybody?
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:28.620]   What's going on in Corinthians and what's going on in 2 Thessalonians and what's going
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:39.700]   on in Colossae that Paul goes out of his way to authenticate that this is from him?
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.540]   When in Corinthians we know what's going on, right?
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.940]   The church is divided, people are questioning his apostleship, who is this guy?
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.180]   And so it was utter chaos.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.700]   So Paul, I can see why Paul would say, "I'm writing this with my own hand."
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.140]   So that they can see that it's coming to them authoritatively, the apostles writing it.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.020]   Second Thessalonians, anybody know what's going on in 2 Thessalonians?
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.740]   False teachers are going out and saying that Jesus already came.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.020]   Remember he talks about the man of lawlessness?
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.300]   And so he gives a whole doctrine of that all these things have to happen before Jesus comes.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.460]   So don't be rattled because some false teacher comes and tells you that the day of the Lord
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.460]   has come.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.580]   It has not come.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:26.140]   So Paul is addressing a very serious issue in the early church where false teaching was
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.140]   going around.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.780]   People were saying that they're apostles and then they're speaking for God.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.260]   So Paul wanted to make sure, right?
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.860]   That what you're hearing is coming from me, it's my own hands.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:40.140]   And again with Colossae because of the big issue going on in Asia Minor, right?
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:45.820]   False teachers have penetrated Ephesus to Laodicea, to Colossae, Galatia, and they were
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.900]   ruining the church.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:53.180]   So Paul had to make sure that they understood that this was coming to them authoritatively.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:15:00.260]   So I want you guys to, let me do one more.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:06.860]   It was imperative that the early church be able to distinguish what was and was not authentic.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:12.180]   In the early church recognized immediately by the Holy Spirit that what Paul was writing
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.840]   was from God.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.380]   Peter himself says that in 1st 2nd Peter 3 15 to 16.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.100]   Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation just as also our beloved brother Paul according
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:28.100]   to the wisdom given to him wrote to you as also in all his letters speaking in them of
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.940]   these things in which are some things hard to understand which the untaught and unstable
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.740]   distort as they do all the rest of scriptures to their own destruction.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.260]   So Peter himself calls Paul's letters scripture, right?
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.380]   So you understand, Apostle Peter understood that Paul's letters were coming to them with
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.460]   authority.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.340]   Now why is all this important?
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.660]   How do you know that the Bible that you have is God's word?
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.800]   We're spending all this time digging and studying the word of God, but can you defend why you
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.580]   believe that?
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:09.500]   Again when you live in a bubble, you know, in the Christian community, like, well it
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.860]   says it and you're supposed to, it's important, but because we don't think, again if we're
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.540]   not careful, we don't think critically until you get out to the world and people begin
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:23.220]   to pluck holes in your thoughts, you don't really ask and think about it.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.060]   Like why do you believe this is God's word?
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:33.040]   What is a typical accusation that liberals or non-Christians throw against Christians
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.620]   about the Bible?
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.620]   Written by man?
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.620]   Didn't the church put it together in 380 some AD?
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.620]   Right?
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.820]   It was almost 300 some years after it was written, the church got it together.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.260]   So clearly it was written by man.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:54.420]   How do you know 300 years later that this was what they had?
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:59.340]   Because they didn't authenticate it, the church didn't ordain it until more than 300 years
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.980]   later after it was written.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.660]   I mean 300 years.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.980]   How do you answer that?
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.380]   We see clearly from the scripture itself that from the moment that they received it, it
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.980]   wasn't just a normal letter.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.700]   We see it just in this text.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.700]   They received it with authority, they shared it with other churches, and it was meant to
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.220]   be consumed universally.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:27.060]   So what happened in the early church is when they got the letter, they most likely copied
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.060]   it.
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.500]   And they probably kept the letter and then they sent that copy to the other church.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.620]   When they read it, they probably sent it on to somebody else.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.640]   And that's how these letters got circulated.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.140]   And the accumulation of the 27 letters that we have in the New Testament are the 27 letters
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.100]   that was authenticated by the church as soon as they received it by the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.580]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.540]   So it wasn't 300 years later.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.780]   It was from the very get-go they had a collection of letters.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:18:02.180]   And so we have a list of these, a whole collection, a list of these as early as 105 AD.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.420]   So again, we're not going to go through the history of all of this, but we know that right
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.260]   off the bat, it wasn't 300 years later, they said, "Well, let's comb through these letters
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.780]   that we have and see which one we're going to accept and which ones we're not going to
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   accept."
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:20.740]   So one of the main criterias that they used to determine which was and which was not a
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:26.580]   collection of this canon of the New Testament was, which are the ones that was ordained
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.740]   by the early church from the get-go?
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.940]   And the 27 letters that we have in the New Testament were those.
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:36.580]   Does that make sense?
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.580]   We should turn the AC on.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.820]   You guys look extra tired today.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:49.300]   Okay, so the New Testament, again, I'm going to ask you guys for some of the review questions.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:56.860]   For discussion questions, I'm going to go back to it later on.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.700]   Let's look at the review questions for next week.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.780]   Can you look at it on the bottom?
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:06.740]   It's on the bottom.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.180]   Review the overview outline of Colossians.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.580]   So go back and take a look.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:20.180]   Remember how the book of Colossians is outlined, the large outline?
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:25.700]   Chapter 1 and 2 are the indicatives, and then chapter 3 and 4 are the imperative.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.340]   This is who God is, what he has done, therefore you should do this.
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.560]   So within that outline, what are the details?
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.580]   So try to say, if I say, "Chapter 2 in Colossians, what is Paul arguing?
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.620]   Chapter 3 in Colossians, what is Paul arguing?"
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.820]   So try to get a large overview outline of the book of Colossians so that you don't go
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.900]   back and forget what we studied.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.220]   Number two, what are the major themes in each section?
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.460]   So in the indicatives, what was the primary thing that he brings up?
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.420]   And in the imperatives, what was the primary application?
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.860]   Remember the put off and the put on?
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.820]   What are we to put off and what are we to put on?
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:10.260]   In the indicatives, what aspect of the gospel is emphasized in Colossians?
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.940]   So try to get some of that out of your overview.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.940]   What verse?
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.300]   Okay, single verse, not a paragraph.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.280]   What single verse captures a key thought in Colossians?
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.620]   If you are able, put it to memory if you can.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.420]   The reason why that helps is, years later when you say Colossians, you're not going
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.420]   to remember all of these details.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.540]   I'm going to say Archipis and you're going to say, "I remember that name somewhere."
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.380]   And you're going to flip through and you're going to find it in Colossians, but you're
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.180]   not going to remember all the details.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.780]   You might remember the large outline, but if you have a key verse, that'll kind of trigger
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.580]   your memory to other things.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.760]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.100]   So even if you can't memorize it, if you know which verse they are, it'll help you to retain
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.060]   some of the stuff that you've already studied.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.700]   What interpretational tools did you glean from this study?
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.660]   Again, this is the hermeneutic stuff that we learned.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.460]   Make sure that scripture interprets scripture.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:12.420]   Make sure that you ask a lot of questions, observations, and what is something that you
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:19.140]   learned that maybe you didn't know how to practice before this study?
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.580]   Review all your notes to answer the following questions.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.840]   What new insight did you gain about God?
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.720]   What new insight did you gain about Jesus and the gospel?
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.500]   What new insight did you gain about yourself and what new application did you make through
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.620]   the study of this letter?
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:37.180]   So these are questions that you should probably be asking every study at the end, right?
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.580]   Because the end goal is not simply to know, but through the book of Colossians, what did
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.580]   you learn about God?
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.540]   What did you learn about Jesus and the gospel?
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.860]   What did you learn about yourself in light of that?
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.960]   And what application did you make in light of all of that?
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:59.180]   So if you miss that, all it'll become is adding knowledge to knowledge to knowledge, okay?
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.820]   Because you've missed the whole purpose of the study, okay?
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.040]   Studying the Bible ultimately is a pursuit of knowing God.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.120]   And then finally, how faithful were you in doing your weekly exegesis on your own?
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.340]   Not just coming to the Bible study and listening to the people.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.380]   How well did you engage in it?
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.920]   How can you improve for the next study?
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:31.220]   Now, if you've never studied the Bible before, I would prefer you coming than not coming,
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.400]   right?
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.380]   Because you'll gain more from coming than not coming.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:41.340]   But if you really want to improve your walk with God and really be impacted by the things
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:46.080]   that you're studying, you have to get in front of the word by yourself.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   You have to.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:56.860]   I mean, your understanding, motivation, focus, soberness is directly linked to how much time
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.960]   and how much effort you put in to staying sober, right?
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:08.480]   So if you're in the habit of just being there, right, it will be reflected in your soberness.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.260]   It will be reflected in your walk with God.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.040]   And you always wonder, "How come I feel so distant from God?"
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.880]   And all your priorities tell you that this is not important.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.220]   So if this is important, then you have to make it important in your time, okay?
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.120]   So again, if that was not a regular habit of yours, I strongly, strongly encourage you
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.440]   next time when you sign up for Bible study, don't sign up to attend Bible study, but sign
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.080]   up to do Bible study, okay?
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   So that's the question.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.840]   Okay, let me jump to the discussion questions for today.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.440]   How confident are you that the 66 books of the Bible are the authoritative and inerrant
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.880]   word of God?
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:55.760]   Typically, if you ask somebody, right, you're having a discussion and you quote the Bible,
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.240]   and you can see in their eyes what kind of authority the Bible has, right?
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   You can say it.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.480]   I mean, you can say the Bible is authority, it's the word of God, but the proof of the
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:14.040]   authority over their life is when the Bible is quoted, how do you react, right?
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.360]   When the Bible is quoted, oh, does that settle the argument?
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.520]   Or it's kind of like, "Well, I mean, I know the Bible says that," right?
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.520]   Is it authoritative?
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.240]   Do you believe that this is God's word, right?
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   Again, we talked about this before.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.960]   People fantasize if God spoke to me audibly, I would take my faith a lot more seriously,
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   right?
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.400]   If God would just speak to me, well, he's speaking through his word.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.240]   And so if we ignore his word, we are ignoring his voice, right?
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.920]   So how confident are you that this is God's word, right?
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.040]   And if you're not, why not, right?
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.080]   What are some hangups that you have?
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:59.640]   I remember my professor in seminary used to say that he used to have to take so much time
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:05.440]   from students who come from secular universities and took religion, religion course, and basically
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.800]   they took a whole year of being attacked about where the Bible came from, why you shouldn't
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.000]   rely on it, and then he had to go back and re-educate them because they were thrown prejudice
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.140]   and they couldn't defend it, right?
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.280]   So much information that we're getting is completely off from prejudiced people who
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.400]   are trying to attack the Bible, right?
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.360]   So it's important for us to at least be confident.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.360]   Why do you believe?
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:33.320]   What caused you to come to conclusion that this is God's word, right?
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:40.380]   Because until you come to that conclusion, everything that you're studying is just nice.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.820]   It's not a command.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.880]   It's not coming from God, right?
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.600]   Because I kind of believe it, not believe it.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.560]   So that's really where our struggle really needs to begin.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   If you're not confident about that, then even the Bible, whatever the Bible says, just doesn't
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.320]   have the same authority over your life, okay?
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.720]   So that's the first question.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.600]   Number two, if what you read in the scriptures contradict your sense of fairness or what
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.840]   makes sense, what is your usual way of dealing with those thoughts?
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.960]   Does your reason have the final say in what you accept as truth or does the Bible have
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   the final say?
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   Okay?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.760]   Do you understand the question?
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:20.380]   Does the end product of what you believe to be true, is it your sense of fairness?
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:25.840]   Do you judge the Bible to be fair or does the Bible judge us to be fair, right?
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.640]   What has the final authority?
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.840]   Three, how can you be sure that your interpretation is correct when there seems to be so many
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.680]   different opinions on any given text?
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.000]   And I'm talking about within the church, right?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.640]   What are some things God has given the church and to us individually to discern the right
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.520]   meaning of any given text?
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:51.740]   That's a common objection that I hear from people who don't study the Bible, right?
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.740]   That's a common objection.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.800]   Well, how can I study the Bible when there's so many interpretations?
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:03.120]   Well, did you ever study the Bible to see if all the interpretation seems reasonable?
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   Right?
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.440]   Majority of the time when people make that objection is because they haven't studied
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.040]   it for themselves.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:15.440]   If you study the Bible for yourself, you'll see majority of the opinions don't make sense.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   Right?
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.200]   Again, you may look at that and say, "Ah, you sound like, you know, like you got it
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   all figured out."
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:28.440]   But one of the most interesting things that I found in studying the Bible is that no matter
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:34.720]   what denomination you are, if they study the Bible verse by verse, book by book, chapter
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:41.440]   by chapter, and no matter where they are, I almost always sit down and we have a great
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.440]   conversation.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.200]   There's almost a universal agreement on majority of what the Bible says.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   Right?
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.920]   If you actually read the Bible.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.480]   Don't take my word for it.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.480]   Do it for yourself.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   Right?
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.240]   Study the Bible for yourself and then test me.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.280]   Read the Bible carefully, exegete it for yourself, and then listen to what I say.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.400]   See if what I say contradict what you see.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   Okay?
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   That's the first step.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.440]   Study the Bible for yourself.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.440]   Don't say everybody has different opinions so we can't know it.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.800]   You'll be surprised how much of that is smoke screen.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.600]   Study the Bible for yourself and you'll be surprised how united we become.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   There's almost a fear.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:26.640]   There's this like satanic fear that was thrown on the church that if you take the Bible too
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.000]   seriously we're going to be divided.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.720]   I find that exactly the opposite.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.520]   We're divided because we don't know the Bible.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.560]   The more we study the Bible, the more united we become.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.560]   Right?
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.400]   Because it is not simply what it says.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.160]   The Holy Spirit guides us.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   Right?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.960]   Again, don't take my word for it.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.840]   Study it for yourself and then examine what I say.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840]   Right?
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.560]   To see if I'm going off.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.560]   Okay?
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.040]   What are some other tools that God has given us in the church?
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.040]   Right?
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.680]   To be able to interpret the Bible correctly.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.760]   Fourthly, how often are you in the word of God?
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.000]   How does your frequent or infrequent interaction with God, God's word, affect your ability
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.720]   to discern truth?
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.920]   Okay?
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.000]   Discerning truth is not just about knowledge.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.760]   Discerning truth is also about the condition of your heart.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   Right?
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.140]   The truth is spiritually concerned.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.420]   So if you're not spiritual, meaning that if your heart is not in the right place, you
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.940]   may know the knowledge, but your heart may lead you astray.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.940]   Right?
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.140]   So if you're not regularly being judged, your thoughts and intentions are not being regularly
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.380]   judged by the word of God.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.700]   Right?
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.700]   Even your opinions, even your thoughts can be tainted.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:41.900]   So the ability to discern truth is directly linked to studying the word of God and allowing
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.500]   the word of God to judge us.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.500]   Okay?
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.940]   So if you think your pursuit of God is reflected in the way you pursue greater knowledge of
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.660]   God's word, can't explain.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.660]   Right?
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.660]   All right.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.660]   So it's pretty explanatory.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.020]   So if you can take some time with your small group as you discuss this, and again, next
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.940]   week, please, please, please come prepared for the overview study.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.420]   So let me pray first and then I'll dismiss you to your group.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:12.020]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:19.180]   Father, help us, Lord God, to know that these are your words, Lord God, your very breath
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:24.060]   that you put in, that it comes to us with authority and that through it that we do not
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:30.500]   read the letters of Paul or for other men, but from you.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:35.100]   Help us, Lord God, in our discussion to have greater insight, greater conviction, greater
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.980]   confidence, Lord God, to know that what we have is from you.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.980]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:39.980]   Amen.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.980]   Amen.
