[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.320]   If you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews 11, verse 22.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.840]   We're going to go back into Hebrews one verse at a time.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.160]   All right, at least for this week again.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:29.680]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 22.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.680]   Reading out of the NASB, "By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.560]   of the sons of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones."
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.560]   Let's pray.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.920]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would anoint this word, that your sheep may hear your voice
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.040]   and follow you and you alone.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.240]   Help us, Lord God, to give you worship that you are pleased with.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.440]   May your name be honored and glorified.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.960]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.160]   Some of you guys know that our church's 24th anniversary is coming up.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.440]   Time has gone by so quickly.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.120]   People often ask, "What was the catalyst?
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.080]   What caused you to want to plant the church?"
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.960]   Our church was not a typical church plant because there was no planning involved.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.120]   There was no desire to plant the church.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.920]   It just kind of happened because the church that I used to serve at in Irvine, I left
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.200]   the church for about a year and I got a phone call and they said that they don't have a
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.160]   pastor here and we need you to come back and help us.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.320]   So I went really to kind of fill in the gap, hoping to help out.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.360]   And then once I got there, the new pastor on the Korean side had a vision that we didn't
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.760]   fit into.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.800]   And so basically he asked us to leave.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.520]   And there's a lot of different things that happened, but we didn't want to leave.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.420]   We couldn't leave because we just had a newborn child at home, an infant, and our church members,
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.880]   we had maybe one working person at the time, and our offering could not sustain us because
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.560]   the people who were with us in the very beginning, they were actually, who are still here, they
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.200]   were actually, most of them were still high school students.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.560]   So they were juniors in high school and those juniors in high school are now turning 40
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.840]   this year, you know, or 40, 41.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.360]   So we were a very young church and there's no way anybody in their right mind would plant
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.880]   the church with that group.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.760]   And so that's exactly what my friends were saying, "Peter, what are you doing?"
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.840]   You know, and again, we didn't plant this church because we wanted to, you know, our
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.080]   typically when you plant the church, you know, you plan and you have, you know, you have
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.160]   the core members that you get together, you have some funding, what's our doctrinal statement,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.600]   what are our bylaws, what denomination are we a part of?
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.800]   And so all of these things are planned and then you execute and you hope to reach these
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.280]   people with this kind of thing and none of that happened in our church, you know.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.560]   So whenever you plant something, you make sure that you got the soil ready, you got
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   the feed ready, you know, and then you water it and you make sure it's out in the sun and
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.280]   you get enough rays and then you go and check up on it.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.640]   Well, none of that happened.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.360]   Like for us, our church plant was kind of like taking a seed and just throwing it out
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.880]   the window and then expecting it to die and then on the way back, we realized, "Huh, they
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   didn't die."
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.560]   That's kind of like the, that was kind of like the genesis of our church.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.120]   And so we got planted out of necessity, just not trying to die.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.680]   That was really the early parts.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.800]   And first year that we had our church retreat was about six years into the church because,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.040]   you know, obviously I was busy taking care of our family and I had to get an extra job
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.000]   to pay for bills because the church couldn't sustain us in the beginning.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.680]   And so for the first six to seven years, we were really just on a survival mode.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.160]   And it was a running joke in the church that whenever one person visited our church, it's
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280]   like revival, you know, because nobody knew who we were, you know.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.080]   And then even our name was weird, Berean.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080]   And then they would say, "Oh, Korean."
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   "No, Berean."
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.680]   You know, and I remember being so frustrated.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   "Berean, read your Bible.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   Berean."
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   Right?
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.440]   And so that's kind of how our church started.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.040]   It's been 24 years that our church has, you know, like come this far.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.120]   And you know, if you ask us the first five or six years of the church, I don't know how
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.840]   many times we thought we're not going to make it.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   We're not going to make another year.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.080]   We're not going to make another year.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.000]   And I was so tempted to, like, I can't do this anymore.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I got two kids.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.800]   I got three kids, you know, and it's just not going to happen.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.880]   But in the totality, 24 years looking back, obviously God's hand was upon it.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.760]   It wasn't necessarily anything that we did.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.000]   And if anybody asked me, like, "What did you do in the early church?"
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.280]   And the only thing I can give you is I didn't quit.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.880]   There was no elaborate planning.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.640]   There wasn't like, "Oh, you know, we sought God and we did this."
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   It's like, no.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.260]   We just didn't want to die, really, in the early church.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.480]   And so clearly, as difficult as the beginning was, God's been faithful.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.280]   And I know that there are, you know, people that I can think of throughout the years that
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.100]   came to faith as a result of us just persevering through all of it, you know.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.720]   And the reason why I share all of this is because it made me think about Joseph.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.880]   Obviously, you know, nowhere near what Joseph's experienced, but Joseph, the man of faith,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.040]   his whole life can be summed up in what his brothers meant for evil, God meant for good.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.700]   That's his whole life, right?
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.340]   We typically think that when bad things are happening, we say, "Well, is that from God
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.140]   or is that from Satan?
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.460]   Is it good or is it evil?"
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.640]   Because we naturally think if it is evil, then God's not there.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.360]   And if we think that God's in control and God's doing this, then we automatically think
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.900]   then evil is not there.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.800]   But from our own personal experience and from what we see in Scripture, what may have been
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.560]   meant for evil, that God meant for good.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.900]   And so evil and God's goodness is working simultaneously at the same time.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.620]   And so we talk about the sovereignty of God, and I don't think anybody has a problem pointed
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.880]   to God's sovereignty when we look back in our life, in history, right?
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.620]   In the past tense, God orchestrated this and this is how I met my wife and God brought
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.440]   me to this and God, you know, allowed me to be a part of this.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   And so even if you're an Armenian, you'll look back and say, "Oh, clearly God directed
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.960]   our lives in this past."
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.840]   But our problem is not past tense, it's future tense, right?
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.200]   Do we believe in the sovereignty of God in the present?
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.960]   Whatever is happening now, do you understand that a sovereign God that you worship is in
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.880]   control and that whatever happened in the past, whatever happened is in the future,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   that whatever was meant for evil, God means it for good.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.080]   Just like it says in Romans 8.28, "God causes all things to work together for good for those
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.040]   who have been called according to his purpose."
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.000]   There's no better example of that than Joseph's life.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.880]   Hebrews chapter 11.22 says, "By faith, Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of Exodus
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   of the sons of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones."
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.840]   Now if you look at that verse, if you know anything about Joseph's life, that doesn't
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.720]   really capture Joseph's life, right?
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.680]   There's so many things that we can talk about and we're going to get to it in a minute.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.920]   But of all the things that Joseph went through, in fact, 13 chapters of the book of Genesis
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.480]   dedicated to Joseph, 13 chapters.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   And of all the things that the author could have highlighted, he said, "When he was dying,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.720]   he made mention of the Exodus and then about his bones."
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.600]   I'm not going to answer that until we get to the very end.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.200]   So the point of this sermon is really going to be at the end.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.120]   But in order to understand the impact of what he's saying here, I think it's good for us
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.680]   to understand his life.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.320]   So if you look at the first part of Joseph's life in Genesis 37, up to 17 years of his
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.700]   life, I mean, he lived a life of bliss.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.480]   He was the youngest child of Jacob and the scripture says that he was beloved by him.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.360]   Imagine, he grew up in a family that was filthy rich because God blessed Jacob and he was
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   loved.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   In fact, if you look at Joseph's life, there is really nothing negative mentioned about
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   Joseph.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:28.000]   The only negative mentioned that we see is in chapter 27, maybe verse 3, it says, "And
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.520]   Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father."
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.640]   Meaning that as he was working out in the field, and that in and of itself isn't bad
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   either.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.380]   Maybe the brothers were cheating other people, right?
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.320]   Maybe they were doing something negative and say, "You know, my dad needs to know about
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   this."
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.480]   And this is the only negative mention about Joseph.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.480]   But he was beloved.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.080]   The very next part says, "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because he was
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.920]   the son of his old age and made him a varicolored tunic."
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.680]   You know, that wasn't very wise of Jacob, right?
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.280]   Not only did he love him, he put on, you know, multicolor, you know, the tunic over him so
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   that his brothers every time, not only were they jealous of him, he highlights him, right?
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.520]   It's almost kind of like putting, you know, like a, like fluorescent light on him so wherever
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.160]   he moves, there's that kid, right, that our dad loves more than us and he made it very
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   clear.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.760]   And so they're already jealous of him.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:33.400]   And it says, 37, 4-3-8, the author of the book of Genesis wants to make it clear how
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.600]   much Joseph was hated.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.260]   And the reason why he was hated was because he was so loved.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.560]   Not because he did anything wrong.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.580]   Starting from verse 4, "His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.680]   and so they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms."
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.080]   They couldn't stand being around him.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.080]   That's what that's saying.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   They didn't just dislike him.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   They hated him.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.400]   They couldn't stand being around him.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.880]   Verse 5, "Then Joseph had a dream."
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.680]   It wasn't bad enough for him to be walking around with a multicolored tunic and they
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.720]   couldn't stand his presence because for whatever reason, Jacob made it very open that that
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.640]   was his favorite child, Joseph on top of that has this dream.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.700]   Now he doesn't, he's not making this up.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.440]   God gave him this dream.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.880]   But you know, if anything that it's a flaw of Joseph is he seems a little bit oblivious.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.080]   His brothers hate him and they're jealous of him and he has this multicolored tunic
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.280]   and he said, "Guess what?
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.880]   I had a dream."
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.680]   And he's excited to tell them about this dream.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.660]   He said, "For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field and lo, my sheave rose up and
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.680]   also stood erect and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheave."
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.920]   I don't know what he was thinking if he thought his brother was like, "What?
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   That's awesome."
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.800]   Obviously, that's not what happened.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.360]   And his brother said to him, "Are you actually going to reign over us or are you really going
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   to rule over us?"
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.760]   So they hated him even more for his dreams, for his words.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.760]   They hated him already.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   They couldn't stand him.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.480]   They said they couldn't speak to him like normal.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.560]   And then he tells them this dream on top of that and he said, "Man, on top of that,"
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.960]   right, he hated him even more.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.680]   But his dream didn't stop there.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.640]   His elevation didn't go above his brother's.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.160]   It went above his parents.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.720]   He has a dream where even the sun and the moon is bowing down and he tells this to his
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   father.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.520]   And his father, as much as he loved his son, he said, "Dad, are you serious?
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.320]   Not only are you going to rule over your brothers, you're going to have us bow down before you?"
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.520]   So Jacob rebukes him, but he never forgot.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.560]   And then it says, verse 11, "His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept this
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.020]   saying in mind."
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.800]   Even though he rebuked him, he said, "Could that possibly be from God?"
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.240]   Because Jacob knows from his own life experience, could this be from God?
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.760]   Well, you know what happens, right?
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:06.160]   Because Jacob was so hated, his brothers are off and taking care of the land and he's there
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.920]   by himself and his father said, "Hey, Jacob, instead of just, you know, moping around at
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.600]   home, why don't you go join your brothers?"
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   And sends them off.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:18.360]   So not only is Joseph oblivious, it seems like even Jacob is a little bit oblivious,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   right?
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.520]   He doesn't realize that he's sending his beloved son to his brothers who just could not stand
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   him.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.240]   So he follows and his brothers have a plan that when he comes, they wanted to actually
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.080]   kill him, not just to sell him off.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.720]   They hated him so much, they wanted him gone.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:43.960]   The only reason why Joseph survives is his oldest brother decides that it's not a good
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.320]   thing to kill our brother, shed his blood.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.440]   So he said, "You know, I suggest that we dig a hole and put him in there," you know, with
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.880]   the plan that maybe after his brother's angers have subsided or he can come back at night
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.600]   and rescue him.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.200]   But by the time Reuben comes back, the brothers have sold him off to the Islamites and the
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:10.300]   Midianites and then they end up selling him to Potiphar, the captain of the guard in Egypt.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.080]   And that's how he ends up in Egypt.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:20.280]   And so his life of misery starts after he has that dream, you know, because he was loved
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:26.640]   by his father, because he was targeted by God's covenant love.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.800]   You would think that after he has this dream, the next stage of his life would be glory.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:40.920]   Instead, this 17-year-old ends up oblivious, being sold into slavery, and he wakes up again
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.040]   as a 70, right?
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.160]   I can understand as an old man, you lived your life and you find out, so you're going
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160]   to ride it out, you know?
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.120]   And that's what I noticed, that the older I get, things don't bother me as much, you
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   know?
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.960]   I remember the first time the doctor told me that I shouldn't be playing basketball anymore.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   I was devastated.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Because basketball, outside of ministry, basketball was the only other thing that I gave my life
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.240]   to, you know what I mean?
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.440]   So when they said, "No more basketball," I felt like, "I'm done.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.080]   What am I, what else am I going to do?"
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.280]   But the older I get, bad news I get, I say, "Okay, I'll ride that out."
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.720]   I live longer than I'm going to live, so, you know, it's okay, it's no big deal.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.640]   But he's 17 years old.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.520]   This guy just started his life, so even a year for him is a long period of time.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:36.320]   So imagine Joseph living as the precious child of the covenant, you know, recipient, his
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:44.200]   father, a rich home, all of a sudden because of his hatred, wakes up as a slave, as a result
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.120]   of his dream that God gave him.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.440]   You would think that he'd wake up just bitter and angry.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.560]   But this is how he's described in Genesis 39 to 2 to 6.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.840]   The Lord was with Joseph.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.920]   What a weird thing to say.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.920]   After being sold into slavery, after his brothers wanted to kill him, in the very next stage
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   of his life as a slave, the Lord was with him.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.840]   Who would ever think?
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.680]   Who would ever think that the Lord was with him?
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.600]   If the Lord was with him, he wouldn't be in this situation.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.480]   If the Lord was with him, that doesn't look like glory.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.320]   Look what he says.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.160]   So he became a successful man and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.360]   Now his master saw the Lord was with him and how the Lord caused all that he did to prosper
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   in his hands.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.760]   Not only was Joseph clear that the Lord was with him, even his master saw that.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.520]   Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant and he made him overseer
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.560]   over his house and all that he owned he put in his charge.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.000]   It came about that from that time he made him overseer in his house and over all that
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.200]   he owned.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   The Lord blessed the Egyptian's house on account of Joseph.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.680]   Because the Lord's blessing was upon all that he owned in the house and in the field.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.780]   So he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge and with him there he did not concern
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.400]   himself with anything except the food which he ate.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.120]   So if you look at that, it's pretty clear that the author is trying to tell us how blessed
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.560]   he was.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.200]   Everything he touched, he was successful.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.120]   And even his master recognized that.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:27.640]   Now if you didn't know where he came from, if he was a born slave and he's being elevated
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.160]   in Potter's house, Potiphar's house, we would agree with that.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.480]   But in the context in which he came here, who would say he was blessed?
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.440]   And I think any one of us would look at his situation and say, "Lord, if you are with
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.400]   me, get me out of here."
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:55.680]   See, what they meant for evil, God is working good simultaneously.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.860]   After that you would think, "You know what?
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.200]   He went through some hardship.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   That was tough.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.800]   He was sold as a slave but he remained faithful, therefore God elevated him and he became the
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.200]   right hand man of Potiphar."
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.360]   And this is a very rich, prominent man in Egypt.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.880]   However, as rich as Jacob is, they're still nomads.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.200]   They don't own any land.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.040]   Compared to this top official in Egypt, they're still poor.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.560]   But he became the right hand man and everything he did, he just left it all up to him.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.120]   He said, "Oh, now the dream is being fulfilled."
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.280]   You would think that's what happens but that's not what happens.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:41.400]   You know what happens in chapter 39 verse 6, Potiphar's wife gets in the picture.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.200]   And here's his problem.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.080]   Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.800]   There's his problem, right?
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:57.520]   If you live in this fallen world, being handsome is a curse.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.100]   So I feel bad for all of you, right?
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.400]   He said he was handsome in form and appearance.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.680]   In form and appearance, he's not talking about just your physical appearance.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.920]   In fact, the word for handsome, it's a generic word for being beautiful because the way we
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.760]   say handsome, we're typically talking about someone's appearance.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.800]   But word for handsome really is more of a generic word meaning beautiful.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.360]   And the reason why he says he was beautiful in form and appearance is like saying he was
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.160]   beautiful inside and out.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.320]   And I remember back in college, one of the best dating advice that I got from somebody,
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:39.080]   he says don't look for good-looking people, look for attractive people.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:44.040]   And so the difference is a good-looking person, if they're not attractive inside, eventually
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.360]   they start to look ugly.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.400]   And then you meet somebody who's very attractive inside, eventually they start looking beautiful.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.080]   Well, Joseph didn't have this problem.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.280]   He said Joseph was beautiful inside and out.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.400]   There was no flaw in this guy, right?
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.480]   No wonder everybody hated this guy, right?
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.400]   He was handsome inside and out.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.920]   And Otterfer's wife notices this and she starts lusting after him and literally begs him to
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.480]   sleep with her.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.480]   He resists.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.880]   And the scripture says that she kept on doing it over and over.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:24.280]   She was literally desperate and begging him and he was able to resist, right?
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.320]   Now, some people may think maybe he was resisting because her eyesight was not good.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.600]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.520]   If you don't know what I'm saying, read the previous chapters, okay?
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.920]   Maybe she wasn't that attractive, maybe her eyesight wasn't that good.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.920]   No.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:47.600]   This is Potterfer's wife, a very rich, prominent man, so I'm pretty sure that she was very
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.080]   attractive and maybe part of the reason why she was so frustrated was because she probably
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.960]   got whatever she wanted.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.200]   Well, she gets so frustrated and she keeps going but he resists.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.600]   And this is what Joseph says in response in verse 9.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.120]   There's no one greater in this house than I and he has withheld nothing from me except
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.280]   you because you are his wife.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.520]   How then could I do this great evil sin against who?
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.760]   Against God.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.560]   Remember why he's here.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.800]   He's here because he had that dream, because his father loved him.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.400]   And so you would think that he'd be bitter and angry, right?
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.920]   Even though he's been elevated, he says he's still concerned because of his loyalty to
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.320]   his master and his loyalty to his God.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.040]   He said, "I can't do this to you."
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:47.080]   Remember, he's a young man just like any other young man with a pretty powerful wife and
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.200]   his life would have been even easier, right?
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.680]   He's a captain of the bodyguard, you know, the pharaoh's bodyguard.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.520]   My guess is that guy's probably never home, right?
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:04.560]   His life, he's already on the top of the hill and he can have whatever he wants but instead
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.560]   because of his loyalty, because of his righteousness, he gets targeted.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.560]   And you know the story.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.200]   Potiphar's wife gets so frustrated and then she makes up a story that this Hebrew came
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.880]   and raped me and Potiphar hears about it.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.720]   And because of his righteousness, because of his loyalty, he ends up going to prison.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.600]   But look what it says about him being in prison.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.640]   Verse 21, "But the Lord was with Joseph and extended kindness to him."
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.640]   How can you write that?
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.800]   I mean, I understand, okay, the first one, we'll sweep that under the rug.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.520]   I don't get it, but how can he do that?
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.840]   But then now he's in prison and he's there for 12 years.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.240]   12 years.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.440]   Now 12 years for somebody who's older doesn't seem that long, right?
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.400]   12 years at 50 or 60 doesn't seem that long.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.640]   For a 17, 18-year-old kid, 12 years is pretty much his life.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.280]   He's putting there 12 years but he said, "The Lord was with Joseph."
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:10.480]   Again, if we don't know the full story, we may look at that and say, "How can the author
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.160]   possibly say that that was God's kindness on him and gave him favor in the sight of
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   the chief jailer?
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.880]   The chief jailer committed to Joseph charge of all the prisoners who were in jail so that
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.320]   whatever was done there, he was responsible for it.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.280]   The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph's charge because the Lord was
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.400]   with him and whatever he did, the Lord made to prosper."
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.680]   Sounds almost identical to what happened when he was at Potiphar's house because the Lord
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   was with him.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.840]   Even though they meant evil, God meant for good and it was happening simultaneously,
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   right?
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.640]   So he spends 10 years in jail in that context and after 10 years, the cupbearer of Pharaoh
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.960]   and the baker has a dream.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.040]   And so he interprets it for them.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.920]   And so he says the cupbearer is going to be released, he's going to be restored back to
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.000]   where his glory.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.120]   The baker actually is going to get hanged and he tells him the story and the cupbearer
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.280]   actually gets released, baker gets hanged.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.640]   As he is telling this to the cupbearer, knowing that he's going to be restored in chapter
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.880]   40 verse 14, Joseph tells him, "I don't ask for anything but one thing.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.200]   Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you and please do me a kindness by mentioning
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.840]   me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.560]   For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and even here I have done nothing
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.240]   that they should have put me into the dungeon."
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.600]   So it wasn't like he forgot.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.880]   How could you?
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.840]   It wasn't like he was some strange, strange person.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   He's like, "Oh, you know, this prison is fun.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.520]   I get to be in charge here."
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:54.720]   He never forgot and that's the one thing that he asked, "Get me out of here."
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   You know the story.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.400]   The cupbearer gets restored and completely forgets for two years.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.720]   So he's in there a total of 12 years.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.680]   Only when the Pharaoh has this dream and no one could interpret and the cupbearer probably
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.480]   for his own benefit, "Oh, I remember this guy who got me out of jail.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   Maybe we can get him and ask."
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:19.400]   And then so Joseph is brought out, stands in front of Pharaoh and Pharaoh asks him about
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.080]   this dream and he interprets it and says, "Your dream basically is for seven years you're
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:28.600]   going to experience prosperity and then for seven years there's going to be extreme famine.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:33.320]   And so during the seven years make sure that you gather all the stuff and be prepared for
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.760]   the next seven years."
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:41.520]   And as a result of this interpretation, he is elevated and he's given charge over this.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.760]   And as he said, that's exactly what happened.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.800]   Seven years of extreme famine or extreme prosperity while everybody was just living their normal
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.860]   life, Joseph made sure that they filled the barns and they were preparing.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:00.400]   So after the seven years is gone, the famine comes in and the second year into their famine,
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   that's when his brothers, they end up showing up to Egypt because they heard that they had
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.560]   food over there.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:14.200]   So Jacob sends his children and they go and they finally meet Joseph for the first time.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.160]   Can you imagine what that meeting would have been like?
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.920]   Joseph, everything that happened to him, every negative thing that happened to him was because
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   his brother.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.040]   He didn't do anything wrong, right?
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.080]   He's like, "What did I do?
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.600]   Why did they hate me so much?"
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:43.200]   And the scene that we see when he finally meets them, that in Genesis chapter 42, 22
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:50.840]   to 24, they're standing in front of their brother and he's kind of toying with them,
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.840]   right?
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.600]   And you can tell there's maybe a little bit of bitterness and anger, but he's not, you
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.040]   know, he had every right to just kind of smash them and done with.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.240]   But instead, he kind of toys with them.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.940]   And then finally, you know, Reuben said, "You see," and you could tell like Reuben was living
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.200]   with guilt all these years.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.440]   And when he sees Joseph coming out harsh, he said, "You see, we're being punished because
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.640]   of what we did to our brother."
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.480]   And this is what happens, 42, 22 to 24.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.920]   Reuben answered them, his brother saying, "Did I not tell you, do not sin against the
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.380]   boy," talking about Joseph, "and you would not listen.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.360]   Now comes a reckoning for his blood.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.840]   They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.400]   He turned away from them and wept."
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:41.860]   It doesn't describe why he wept, whether he was angry, relieved.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.080]   It doesn't describe what happened.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.640]   And I maybe, you know, I don't think maybe he knew.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:59.280]   This is something that he held on in his heart for 12, 13 years, one year in Potiphar's house,
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.160]   12 years in prison, and other nine years go by.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:13.480]   For over two decades, he was forcefully removed from his beloved family, his father and his
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480]   mother.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.840]   And he sees his brothers for the first time, and he just can't control his emotion.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:25.440]   In fact, not only does he can't control his emotion, all throughout chapter 42 to 46,
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.480]   it is repeated over and over and over and over and over again that he kept on weeping
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.840]   and weeping and weeping.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.160]   Up to this point, Joseph seems like Superman.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.600]   I mean, he gets sold into slavery, and he just remained faithful.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.560]   I got to be faithful to God.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.820]   He gets sold into, you know, sent into prison, and then he remains faithful.
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.320]   And then the cupbearer forgets him for two years, and he still remains faithful.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.160]   But when he meets his brothers, he finally can't contain himself, and he just bursts
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   out in weeping.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:05.160]   Chapter 43, 29, "As he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his younger brother
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.840]   from the same mom, he says, 'Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?'
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.960]   And he said, 'May God be gracious to you, my son.'
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.880]   Joseph hurried out, for he was deeply stirred over his brother, and he sought a place to
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.520]   weep, and he entered his chamber and wept there."
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.380]   Then chapter 45, verses 1 and 2, "Then Joseph could not control himself before all those
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:32.520]   who stood by him, and he cried, 'Have everyone go out from here!'
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.540]   So there was no man with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.760]   He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard of
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   it."
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.920]   And this is chapter 45, 13-14.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.880]   "Now you must tell my father of all the splendor in Egypt and all that you have seen, and you
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.480]   must hurry and bring my father down here.'
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.800]   Then he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck."
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   And then in Genesis 46, 29, when he finally sees his father, "Joseph prepared a charity
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.480]   and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:14.880]   As soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time."
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:23.840]   For 22 years, for 22 years, he was removed from his dad.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:32.440]   His beloved family was sitting in prison, sold as a slave.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.000]   Humanly speaking, all you see is evil.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.560]   Humanly speaking.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:46.680]   See, his brothers, after his father dies, they think that maybe Joseph is being kind
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.160]   to them because of his dad.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.920]   He didn't want to sadden his dad.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.800]   As soon as Jacob dies, his brothers are fearful.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.840]   Now, now he's going to get us.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.040]   And it is in that context when his brothers are afraid after the father dies, "Are you
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.040]   going to kill us?"
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.480]   And Joseph, in that context, answers, "You may have meant it for evil, but God meant
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.560]   it for good."
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:16.520]   You may have meant it for evil, but God meant it for good.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:22.440]   You know what that reminds me of in book of Revelations chapter 21 verse 4, when we see
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.280]   a promise of what's coming?
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.760]   It says, "And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes and there will no longer be
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.760]   any death.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.240]   There will no longer be any mourning or crying or pain.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.160]   The first things have passed away."
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.760]   You and I are walking, you know, we're in between.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.160]   We're saved, but we're not in heaven yet.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:53.960]   And I don't know a single person, young or old, who doesn't have pain, experienced some
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.840]   sort of pain.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.840]   Maybe it was recent.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.460]   Maybe it's something that happened when you were younger.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.760]   Maybe it was related to family.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.480]   Maybe it was friendship.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:09.760]   Whatever it was, I don't know anybody who doesn't know some sort of pain, pain of rejection,
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:17.600]   isolation, failure, broken families, whatever it may be.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.240]   What the world meant for evil, God meant for good.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:28.640]   So we can look at sovereignty, and we clearly see sovereignty when we look at the past.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.280]   Because you could see how God orchestrated.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.960]   The only reason why we got here is because God is sovereign.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.760]   But the problem that we have is not the past tense, it's the present and the future tense.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:44.200]   That whatever might have happened, whatever pain you have experienced, if we focus on
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:51.080]   what they did to me and completely forget that in the midst of all of that, God meant
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.280]   it for good, you missed the whole point.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:04.840]   I remember when I became a Christian, I was just in the beginning process of getting into
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.880]   some bad stuff.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.040]   I already had two police records, and I couldn't care.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.520]   I was so angry that my parents moved around so much, that we didn't have money, my dad
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.000]   was a pastor, and I didn't want any of that.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.520]   Came to the United States when I was seven, went to Philadelphia, moved to Kansas.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.760]   And then from Kansas, I didn't feel like I belonged, and I went to Atlanta and really
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.760]   didn't belong in Atlanta.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.000]   Got excited about going back to Korea, thinking I'm going to go back home, and then they kept
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.480]   on telling me to go back home.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.440]   I said, "What?"
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.000]   I thought I was home.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.520]   The second time we came to the United States, I came kicking and screaming.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.640]   I did not want to come.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.280]   I did not want to come.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.120]   And I was crying the whole time.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.680]   The airport, until we got here.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.760]   If I get old enough, I'm going to go back, I'm going to go back.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:00.720]   And I had so much anger inside of me, and people would say, "Hey, Peter, if you do that,
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   you're not going to graduate."
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   I don't care.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.480]   "Peter, if you keep doing that, you're going to get arrested."
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.880]   I don't care.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.440]   "If you keep doing that, you're going to get hurt, or you're going to hurt somebody."
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.720]   I don't care.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:19.040]   So how do you talk to a kid who doesn't care if he dies, who doesn't care if he goes to
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.440]   jail?
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   You couldn't.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:28.920]   There's nothing that you could have said that could have made everything okay until I met
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.480]   Christ.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.540]   What changed me wasn't years of theology, years of counseling.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:45.640]   What changed me was instantaneously knowing that God was in the midst of all of that.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.880]   God was in the midst of all that.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.880]   God did that.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:53.120]   He's the one who did that to me in order to bring me to that spot so that I can meet
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.120]   Him.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:34:00.600]   And so the moment I realized that God was in the midst of that, all of that completely
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   changed.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.560]   They didn't do this to me.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.640]   God did it.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.000]   God brought me here.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.400]   God forced me to be here, or else I would have never met Him.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:18.080]   Instantly meeting the sovereign God who loved me changed everything.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:28.760]   What I experienced as evil all of a sudden became good instantaneously.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.840]   Knowing and believing in sovereign God changes everything.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.560]   It changes everything.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.400]   Let's go back to the original question.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.320]   Of all the things that could have been highlighted in Joseph's life, how he remained faithful
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:52.440]   as Potiphar's slave, that even with injustice, he gets thrown into prison for over a decade,
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.920]   and then he remained faithful and God raises him up and the whole nation of Israel is delivered
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.520]   because of this man.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.040]   None of that is mentioned.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.720]   All that is mentioned is at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the sons
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:13.160]   of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:17.360]   When does exodus happen?
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.680]   Four hundred years later.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.360]   Four hundred years later.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.520]   After Joseph dies, four hundred years pass, another pharaoh comes up and he completely
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.880]   forgets about Israel and what Joseph did, and they go into slavery for four hundred
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.880]   years.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:40.120]   When he is dying, he mentions four hundred years from now, when we leave, leave for where?
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.720]   They didn't have land, remember?
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.920]   They didn't have land yet.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:50.200]   So Joseph is talking about a prophecy that he heard from his father and his father and
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   the father before that.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.720]   Now where did he hear this?
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.940]   Genesis chapter 15, 13-14.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:01.440]   When God was ratifying this covenant that he made with Abraham, this is what God says
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.440]   to Abraham, Abram.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   God said to Abram, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:13.520]   that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.560]   But I will also judge the nations whom they will serve, and afterwards they will come
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.920]   out with many possessions."
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.520]   Do you think Joseph heard that?
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.400]   Yes.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   Most likely.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.480]   And remember, why was Jacob so hungry to receive his father's blessing?
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.280]   It wasn't simply about money.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.120]   This family, this family is established and persevered through hardship because of this
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.200]   covenant promise that God made.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.040]   And I can guarantee you that that was passed down from generation to generation.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.520]   So as Joseph was dying, he doesn't mention about all the accomplishments and everything
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.960]   that he's done.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:55.200]   All he remembers is, God said, "We're going to be imprisoned, and when we leave, take
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.000]   me with you."
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.200]   That's what's highlighted in his life.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   And that's exactly what happens.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.040]   It says, not only are you going to be imprisoned, when you come out, God's going to make you
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.040]   wealthy.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.880]   I mean, these guys were slaves for four hundred years.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.240]   What money would they have?
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.600]   Exodus chapter 12, 35 to 36, it says, "Now the sons of Israel had done according to the
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.840]   word of Moses, for they had requested from Egyptians articles of silver and articles
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.200]   of gold and clothing.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.840]   And the Lord had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.560]   them have their request, thus they plundered the Egyptians."
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.280]   Just like God said.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   Just like God said.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.200]   These slaves, who had nothing, came out filthy rich.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.280]   It doesn't say they just took some stuff.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:47.640]   They plundered the Egyptians, and they came out more wealthy than they ever were.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.160]   Just like God said.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.820]   And just like Joseph asked them to, in Exodus 13, 19, Moses took the bones of Joseph with
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.440]   him, for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, "God will surely take care
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.120]   of you, and you shall carry my bones from here with you."
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.960]   Remember who Joseph is.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:12.160]   Joseph is the second man next to Pharaoh.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:18.460]   If he was going to get any kind of adoration or veneration, it would have happened in Egypt.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:24.080]   Not to go with a bunch of slaves that was being slaves and mistreated for four hundred
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.280]   years, "Make sure you take me with you."
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.160]   In fact, at the end of his life, when he was buried, it says he was embalmed.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   That's not a Jewish practice.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:38.760]   That was only the high officials in Egypt did that.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.400]   And that's why he was preserved, and that's why they carried him along.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:47.360]   In Joshua 24, 32, it says, "Now they buried the bones of Joseph when they entered."
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.920]   Just like God said.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   So you know what this tells me?
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.360]   This whole story about Joseph isn't even about Joseph.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:03.520]   This whole story about Joseph is God's faithfulness to his covenant promise.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.080]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   I don't know.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.600]   It's jaw-dropping to me, but let me conclude with this, okay?
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:18.320]   In Genesis 47, 8 through 10, Pharaoh gets to meet Jacob, Joseph's father, right?
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.400]   And they have this conversation, and this is what Jacob said.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.000]   Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many years have you lived?"
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:32.760]   So Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my sojourning are 130, few and unpleasant."
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.160]   That's how Jacob described his own life.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.400]   Here's a man who wrestled with God.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   He was conniving.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:44.560]   He was constantly maneuvering, make sure that he got the blessing of God, and he gets the
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   blessing of God.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.920]   His life is actually changed as one who contends with God.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:53.600]   But when Jacob sees his life, at the end of his life, this is not in the middle, at the
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.160]   very end of his life, he said, "My years are few and they are unpleasant."
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:05.960]   So did God actually bless this man or not?
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   Jacob understood.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:13.120]   The blessing is not he had a nice house or he lived long life.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.880]   It was actually very unpleasant, he says.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.280]   He held on to the covenant promise of God.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.440]   That even as they were delivered, he said, "No, we're going to go into bondage.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.240]   In 400 years, when you leave, take me with you."
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.120]   He understood.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   You know what's interesting?
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.320]   You know how it ends in verse 10?
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.960]   "And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and ran from his presence."
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.600]   Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.480]   Do you know who Pharaoh is?
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.840]   Pharaoh is worshipped as a god in Egypt.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:49.960]   He, humanly speaking, he's a king of kings and lord of lords.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.720]   Jacob is a guy who would have died.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.400]   It was only because of Joseph interpreting this dream, Pharaoh allowed him, and the only
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:04.760]   reason why he's even having a meeting with him is because he was being generous to Joseph.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.640]   And Jacob meets him and says, "My life is long, you know, short and unpleasant."
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.880]   And then he blessed Pharaoh.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.520]   So if you don't read this carefully in context, it's like, "Oh, he blessed him.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   Went."
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.840]   Do you know how ridiculous this would sound?
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:32.160]   Jacob, almost homeless, is meeting the god of Egypt, and he ends up blessing him.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.840]   Humanly speaking, the audacity.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.600]   Possibly think that he's going to leave, it's like, "The Lord bless you."
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.320]   But what did you just do?
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.320]   Humanly speaking.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:51.600]   Jacob's power was not him, not his wealth, not his vast experience.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.440]   The Lord was with him.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:42:00.720]   From God's perspective, how dare Pharaoh lift his head before his God?
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.200]   This story is not about Joseph.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.000]   None of this is about any of these people.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.240]   They just happen to play a small part in what God is doing in redemptive history.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.440]   And that's why what's highlighted here is that he, at the end of his life, because he
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:23.400]   believed 400 years later when we are free and God fulfills this promise, "Take me with
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.720]   you."
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.240]   That's why that's highlighted.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:36.800]   I don't know about you, but believing in this sovereign God changes everything.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.520]   Everything that happened in the past, everything that's happening now, and whatever may come
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.620]   in the future, it changes everything.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:50.140]   Because the God who loves us is sovereign.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:59.020]   Whatever was meant for evil, God is working for good, for his purpose and his glory.
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:06.740]   So I don't have a neat package and say, "Okay, now go do this."
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:12.140]   But I think the central question that we always need to wrestle with, not just acknowledgment
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.340]   of his sovereignty, but how is his sovereignty affecting you?
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.480]   What are the fears that you have?
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.520]   How is that related to God's sovereignty?
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:30.020]   What bitterness do you hold onto where sovereignty exists?
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.620]   Once we embrace that and truly believe it, it changes everything.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:39.260]   Because no matter what happens, God is going to work it out to take us where he plans to
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.780]   take us.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.060]   Amen?
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.420]   Let's pray.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:53.460]   As our worship team comes up, let's take a few minutes to, again, just thank God for
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.220]   his goodness.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:03.900]   This morning, even before we make any petition, if we're true believers of his sovereignty,
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.500]   think of the worst thing that has happened to you.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.380]   Think of the struggle that you may be in now.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:16.380]   Think about the fear that you have that if this continues, what's going to happen?
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:20.940]   And when you think about his sovereignty, thank him.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:27.380]   Whatever happened, whatever's happening, whatever's going to happen, that God did it.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.720]   God's purpose is in it.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.220]   And he's working for our benefit.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.100]   So let's take some time to thank him, again, as our worship team sets up and leaves.
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.980]   >> Thank you.
