[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   As we begin our service,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.300]   I'd like to read a Bible verse for us.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.840]   It is from Psalm 20, verse seven.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.800]   Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.260]   but we trust in the name of the Lord, our God.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.720]   What a blessing it is that we serve a God who is faithful,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   who is faithful to his promises to himself,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.720]   and he will never fail us.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.440]   And so with that, we will begin our service
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.940]   with the song "Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus."

[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.600]   and ask that after the service is done,

[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.240]   and you'll all see our welcome team members
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.400]   in the blue vest, too.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.080]   We love to meet you, provide any information you may need,
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.020]   so please join us there.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.520]   Likewise, for new visitors,

[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.400]   on what our ministry philosophy is,
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.360]   and if you have any questions,
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.760]   that's a great place to ask, too.

[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.160]   that we've put together.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.320]   If some of you are here
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.400]   and you're not just simply new to the church,
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.080]   you're new to faith,

[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.500]   we're going to be going through just simply

[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.320]   and we'll also have our outreach ministry team members
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.640]   there to ask any questions,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.020]   or answer any questions you may have there.

[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.620]   I want to make mention of a opportunity
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.240]   for fellowship for family ministry.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.880]   On Saturday, the 22nd, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.140]   at Bolsa Chica State Beach,
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.620]   there's going to be this fellowship opportunity
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.540]   where the families can come together,
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.460]   share in a meal, there'll be activities,
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.740]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.280]   So please be on the lookout for that.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.140]   We do want to take a head count,
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.500]   so that will also be on our events portion
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.160]   of the app or the website.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.740]   As a quick heads up,
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.480]   please note that members meeting
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.800]   is going to take place on the 23rd.

[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.760]   the members meeting starts at 1.30,
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.160]   and because we didn't want people
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.920]   just to have too much, I guess, downtime,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.440]   but for some of you guys,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.760]   it may not be enough time to go out and grab, et cetera.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.820]   Just plan ahead, and know that the meeting
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.200]   will start promptly at 1.30.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.440]   Okay, let's take a moment to pray together,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.360]   and then for those of you who have offering
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.980]   in the check form, you can submit that at the entrance,
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.400]   or otherwise you can give it digitally.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   Let's pray together.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.240]   Lord God, we thank you and praise you.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.800]   We thank you, Lord, that to us you grant
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.880]   and give the knowledge from your word,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.000]   and then even then, we recognize that,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.540]   Lord, we're hard of hearing.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.180]   Sometimes our ears, our hearts are dull.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.820]   Lord, we thank you that you give us illumination,
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.140]   you give us understanding,
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.640]   you give us conviction of faith and growth,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.120]   and so, Lord, we praise you,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.880]   and also, today, as we join in worship together,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.680]   we recognize this is a huge privilege for us
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.160]   to come to you praising and glorifying you,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.900]   for there is no greater joy, God,
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.880]   than to exalt and lift you up together.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.040]   We do also just pray that then our hearts
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.320]   would be so desiring to honor you in every way,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.020]   not just a set time on Sunday,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.700]   but in every way that we live our lives,
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.240]   and so, we also pray for the offering
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.900]   to be expressive, God, of our heart's desire for you,
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.420]   our longing to render to you the worship you deserve
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.840]   to give to you, Lord God,
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.780]   and by way of desiring, God,
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.380]   that your kingdom work would continue to go forward.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.420]   So, Lord, we pray for the offering,
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.980]   and again, this time that we have now
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.720]   in worship and hearing of your word and singing,
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.760]   may it be pleasing in your sight, in Christ's name, amen.

[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.540]   Amen, you may be seated.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:24.780]   - Okay, good morning again, everyone.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.820]   Please turn your Bible to Romans chapter nine.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.460]   And as you turn there,
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.020]   just to note again, last Sunday,
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.700]   we hit the first portions of the Romans chapter nine
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:45.620]   and talking about Paul's heart grieving for the lost,
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.500]   then teaching, the word of God teaching us
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.300]   that salvation is by God's choice
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.580]   because it's a merciful, merciful act of God.
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.980]   For today, let's take a moment to read
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:05.980]   verse 22 through 24.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.380]   And it says, "What if God,
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.420]   "though willing to demonstrate his wrath
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.800]   "and to make his power known,
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.980]   "endured with much patience,
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.180]   "vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.480]   "and he did so to make known the riches of his glory
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.820]   "upon vessels of mercy,
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.460]   "which he prepared beforehand for glory,
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.920]   "even us whom he also called,
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.940]   "not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles."
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.780]   Let's pray.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:40.020]   Heavenly Father, as we tackle and hear from your word,
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.980]   we pray, God, that you would grant to us understanding
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.420]   as you have so desired for us to know.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.080]   We hear in your word that it has been your design
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.080]   to make known your mercy, your power, your glory, and more.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.200]   It is our prayer, God, that you would help us see it.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.560]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.160]   So if you were not here with us last week,
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.440]   it was part one of just a two-part series
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.600]   on the doctrines of election,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.400]   but first seeing God's character
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.360]   and heart of mercy in that election.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.180]   That election should be described always
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.780]   with gracious choice of God, okay?
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.100]   And so in that way,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.460]   because it's really pivotal to understanding election,
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.180]   I'll give like the shortest summary of last week's sermon,
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.040]   which is simply that in terms of who is saved,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.780]   the question of who can be saved,
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.780]   that answer is simply God's merciful choice, period.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.920]   God saves based on his merciful choice,
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.840]   and that's the end of it.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.960]   There may be those who wonder and have a difficult time,
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.320]   well, what about my free will?
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.960]   And I'm just going to say pretty bluntly,
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.240]   and then hopefully you can look back at the sermon last week
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.800]   to see the description.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.560]   He gives no consideration.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.960]   He doesn't need man's consent.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.920]   There is no regard for the free will of man
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.980]   when God makes his choice,
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.640]   because it's from eternity past.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.000]   It's from before the foundation of the world.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.180]   It's from the intention of his heart.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.560]   The election is derived from his own character.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.440]   It says it's his purpose,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.800]   and it's a free gift of promise he gives
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.260]   to completely dead people, right?
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.520]   It's something that he gives to individuals
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.520]   who have not the power to exercise something of a,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.500]   oh, I'll grab that life vest,
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.100]   or I'll jump the fence over.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.640]   No, no, no, that's,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.160]   dead people don't jump fences
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.320]   to enter into the next kingdom.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.000]   This is God giving all from his accord.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.060]   And so that's what a lot of the scripture says.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.840]   When we look at the entirety of Romans chapter nine,
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.360]   we began with God has always done this.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.800]   It wasn't just because you happen
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   to have the blood of Abraham,
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.480]   but it was always person that God placed his promise on.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.400]   And at certain points,
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.780]   it happened to even be counter-cultural, counter-intuitive.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.760]   I gave it to the younger brother.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.420]   I gave it to the weak.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.660]   I gave it to whom I desired.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.720]   Why?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.660]   He says, because it's my choice.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:33.460]   God says, I choose graciously whom I will have mercy on
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.900]   and whom I will have compassion on.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.900]   In order to highlight this gracious nature
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.540]   of God's election,
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.460]   or the election that God exercises,
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.540]   I am going to read a couple passages for you.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.540]   One is from Ephesians chapter two,
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.700]   very famous passage on the whole of the summary
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.560]   of the fact that salvation is by grace, right?
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.680]   Reading to you starting from about verse eight.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.300]   Ephesians two, verse eight says,
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.780]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.500]   "It's not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.600]   "Not as a result of works so that no one may boast."
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.280]   When it says no one may boast,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.040]   you can't even boast like,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.240]   oh, I'm so glad I made this choice, okay?
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.640]   I'm gonna explain that a little bit later,
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.800]   but let's say we find ourselves
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.360]   on the side of the kingdom of Christ,
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.880]   and we see across the way those individuals
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.840]   who are in the kingdom of darkness.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.920]   There is no way that we will find ourselves there,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.440]   look at each other and say,
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.080]   aren't you glad you chose this kingdom?
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.520]   Because that's not the way the scriptures describes it.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.260]   He says in verse 10, "We are his workmanship,
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.180]   "created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.880]   "which God prepared beforehand."
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.120]   Another way to look at it
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.900]   is Romans chapter 11, verse five and six.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.460]   Apostle Paul says, "In the same way then,
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.760]   "there has also come to be at the present time
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.160]   "a remnant according to God's gracious choice.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.540]   "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on basis of works,
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.120]   "otherwise grace is no longer grace."
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.600]   If we use the paradigm and the analogy
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.680]   that salvation is simply a gift,
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.440]   an incredible treasure given to you,
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.920]   we have to think of it as purely then
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   it's God and his initiative giving it to again dead people.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   Another way to look at this is 2 Thessalonians 2,
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.300]   13 through 14.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.880]   But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren,
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.240]   for love by God because God has chosen you
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.540]   from the beginning for salvation through sanctification
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.620]   by the Spirit, faith in the truth.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.180]   It was for this he called you through the gospel
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.320]   that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.000]   Last week what I said was
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.740]   that the election and sovereign choice God exercises
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.420]   is an all-inclusive choice of God.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.120]   And what I meant by that was
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.460]   in this passage in 2 Thessalonians,
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.740]   you notice that it's an error for us to think of election
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.940]   as God long, long time ago just saying,
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.220]   "Okay, you can come in."
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.660]   That is not election.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.420]   Election is God choosing you for glory.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.100]   Election is God choosing you to embed his Spirit.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.300]   Election is God choosing to sanctify you.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.060]   He is involved, he is planning, executing
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.280]   every single portion of your salvation.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   And we believe that all of it is of God's mercy.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.520]   If salvation is God's to give,
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.480]   then even the decision, so to speak,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.000]   even the election part of it,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.360]   that too is all gracious.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.880]   And the reason why I'm talking about this
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.480]   is because I still, I think we have, obviously,
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.360]   a difficulty thinking and perceiving that.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.480]   And in some sense, I kind of just jokingly said,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.540]   "Hey, election's simple.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.160]   "Let me just summarize this to you in one sentence."
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.480]   In one sense, election is very simple.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.300]   When God tells us in his word very clearly
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.400]   who is saved and he says, "It's by my choice.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.120]   "My choice stands," is what God says,
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.700]   then that's the end of the discussion.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.320]   The election's true.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   However, obviously, we have questions
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.060]   and we have difficulties.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.640]   And some of these difficulties pretty much
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.680]   have been already anticipated within this passage.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.160]   Those difficulties are like, "Wait a minute.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.600]   "Some of that just sounds very unfair."
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.120]   And I try to reiterate that it is not just
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.680]   some kind of arbitrary decision God does
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.820]   like the way we would.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.800]   We would just pick some numbers.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.820]   We would just do a, "Well, in order to be fair,
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.960]   "I'm not gonna look, I'm just gonna," you know?
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.420]   That is not what God is doing.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.120]   But what's more, another question
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.440]   that Apostle Paul anticipated,
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.100]   or the scripture anticipates,
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:10.100]   is that philosophically, verse 19, Romans 9, 19,
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.160]   he says, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.960]   "You're saying this is your choice.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.800]   "Then that means it's not my fault.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.460]   "If I don't choose God, if I reject Christ,
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.800]   "then that's not my fault.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:26.220]   "How is it my fault if you're that sovereign?
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.400]   "You've already determined who's in heaven.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.740]   "You've already determined the end of the game.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.680]   "How in the world do you still hold me
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.780]   "responsible for that?"
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.420]   But scripture is very, very clear.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.900]   "You are responsible."
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.980]   I will say it in kind of, I guess, some really,
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.740]   what sounds a bit harsh, but just true
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.820]   and blunt true statements.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.920]   Every individual who's going to receive
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.500]   the punishment of hell, damnation, or condemnation,
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.840]   they thoroughly deserve it.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.080]   Any individual who's being punished by God
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.380]   is because they deserve it.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.420]   There is no individual who should have received,
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.540]   who should have received grace but never did,
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.680]   who should have received mercies but they never did,
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.840]   meaning there is no punishment that God is giving out,
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.400]   no retribution, no vengeance that is unfair or undeserved.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.220]   But interestingly enough, this passage strikes us
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.240]   as very, very difficult because again,
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.600]   remember the last time, when God says something like,
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.000]   "But Jacob I loved and Esau I hated,"
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.280]   it just seems so unfair.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.320]   And then if you tell us, "Well, it's my choice
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.200]   "and it's not God regarding my future decision,
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.320]   "but it's all God and his own initiative,"
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.640]   then it's fair to ask.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.960]   And I wanna say that I too join with you in thinking,
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.420]   man, that's weird because I feel like
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.260]   I'm making a decision.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.020]   I know I made a decision.
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.220]   I went to the floor and cried when I received Christ.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.140]   I responded to the gospel.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.820]   Isn't it me?
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.260]   And then what about my, the genuineness about my response,
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.380]   my emotions, my volition?
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.960]   Isn't that real?
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.980]   As you guys probably know of John Piper,
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.060]   what's really interesting is upon this topic,
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:25.060]   he said, "Romans chapter nine is his most studied passage."
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.180]   The reason why is because really interestingly enough,
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.180]   this individual by John Piper,
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.020]   when he was 22, graduated college
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.100]   and decided to go into seminary,
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.380]   he said he was 100% on the side.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.300]   No, we make decisions.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.820]   God doesn't touch this place
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.500]   because he wants this to be a real reaction, right?
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.900]   And so he said he actually challenged his professor.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.420]   He grabbed his book and said, "Look at me.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.060]   "I am a free agent making my choices."
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.120]   And he dropped this book and said, "I dropped it."
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.700]   And he was defiant towards his professor saying,
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.940]   "If you're trying to tell me that God
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.220]   "predetermines these choices in me,
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.280]   "then show me because I make decisions today.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:13.080]   "Remember, the truths that God is revealing to us,
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.400]   "these are precious mysteries of God
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.900]   "we would never come to conclusions on our own.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:24.960]   "They're precious mysteries of God trying to show to us.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.200]   "Do you have any idea," and I'm gonna rephrase it,
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.220]   "how secure your salvation really is?
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:36.560]   "When you say, 'If God is for us, who can be against us?'
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.680]   "Do you have any idea what you're saying
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.740]   "when you say that statement?
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:47.200]   "Do you have any idea how deeply I love you?
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.000]   "Do you have any idea how vast are my thoughts of you?
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.020]   "Do you have any idea," you know,
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.960]   parents will say this certain times, right?
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.360]   "Do you have any idea what it did for you
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.920]   "when you were younger, you know?
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.600]   "When you were just a toddler,
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.660]   "when you were just growing up
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.520]   "and you were that rebellious teen,
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.980]   "do you remember when God can say to us,
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.760]   "Do you have any idea how from long ago,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.580]   "before your form, before your structure was even made,
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.320]   "I already knew you?"
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:21.860]   God's sovereign election and sovereign choice to us
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:27.380]   was given to us to show us,
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.120]   when you worship me, this is how powerful I am.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.480]   When you trust me, this is how trustworthy I am.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.780]   You would never know because you were never there.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.780]   Let me tell you, your salvation I prepared from long ago.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.060]   That's what you should hear.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.600]   The doctrine of election is not a harsh reality
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.060]   by which we're supposed to just,
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.740]   oh, woe is me, then maybe I'm not one of them.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.460]   Oh, woe is me, maybe then I just sit back
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.840]   and let things happen.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.460]   We have people out in Korea sacrificing time, money, energy,
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.140]   putting all of their efforts just to plead with somebody,
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.500]   be reconciled to God, why?
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.940]   I don't know, that's not why God gave us this truth.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.380]   This truth was introduced from Romans 8.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.060]   Your salvation is so secure.
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.720]   Apostle Paul says, "I am convinced nothing will separate me
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.660]   "from the love of God."
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.500]   Why?
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:32.260]   It's because God in his sovereign choice gave it to you.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.440]   So with that said, today from Romans chapter nine,
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.740]   there's a second theme.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:44.500]   This passage to us presented the truth of election
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.700]   from the standpoint of mercy.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.500]   And all through chapter nine, if you read it,
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.120]   you'll just see it again and again.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.060]   You don't understand.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.660]   You keep thinking of it as like,
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.480]   I'm not being fair to policy.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.140]   I'm exercising mercy.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.060]   Chapter 11 will say the same thing.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.500]   You don't understand.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.100]   You think these people are just lost
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.540]   and these people are done
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.540]   and these people will never ever make it
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.140]   and you guys are better.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.300]   They'll squash all that.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.280]   None of you would have ever come to this conclusion
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.460]   because I'm exercising mercy.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.980]   But then there's a second theme that God embedded
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.140]   into this portion of questions and rationale and reasons,
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:27.660]   which is the election shows God's power.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.600]   And so today, there isn't a whole lot of practical,
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.940]   you know what you need to do this week?
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.540]   You know what you need to say to unbelievers?
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.100]   Today is just gonna be a whole lot of like,
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.980]   I know God is powerful.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.540]   I've heard it before.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.780]   I know he's majestic.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.280]   I know he's up here.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.820]   But I'm gonna try to challenge you.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.820]   How high, truly how majestic is God in your perspective?
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:58.200]   How powerful do you really think he is?
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.900]   Let's take a look at the very first point
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:04.740]   I want to highlight to you.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.160]   And the very first point is we must appreciate
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.100]   God's infinite power in his authority.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:17.320]   First point, you must appreciate God's infinite power
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.420]   in his authority.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.220]   Power and authority go hand in hand,
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.420]   pretty much very synonymous.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.720]   But authority is something more unique
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.240]   and we can describe it, especially just from the passage
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   that we were looking at.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.580]   We take a look at this passage and it says,
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.500]   well, verse 19, you will say to me,
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.980]   why does he still find fault?
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.480]   Like, why is he treating me like it's my fault then
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.180]   if he's so sovereign, right?
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.500]   And then it asks this question, who resists his will?
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.980]   The answer to that is kind of interesting
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.860]   because we would answer, yeah, we believe from Scripture
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.340]   when there is sin, when there is rejection,
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.620]   it is your fault.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.920]   If there's hardening of heart, it is your responsibility.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.360]   But the other side of that question,
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.000]   who can resist his will, is nobody.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.840]   And then so they're stuck in a hard place
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.000]   and you're like, then what gives?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.960]   How do you reconcile this?
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.000]   And to that question, how can you reconcile this?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.880]   God gives this interesting answer,
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.040]   which is not really an answer.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:21.160]   He doesn't give us a reconciliation of those two thoughts.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.360]   He just asked the question, who are you?
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.020]   You know how sometimes throughout the Scriptures,
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.940]   there are moments when there's questions asked,
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.020]   but rather than getting an answer, you get questioned back?
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.180]   And this question back, we can describe it as
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.620]   a kind of like radical wake-up call.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.980]   Before you ask even your question,
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.220]   there is so much ignorance bound up into the question,
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.660]   I have to have you think about your entire paradigm.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.300]   Within our worldview, in a box,
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.620]   if you think about our mind,
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.380]   there are big, big pieces.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.300]   The biggest piece should be God, what you know about him.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.420]   The next piece is how this world works and its laws,
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.380]   right, and its pattern.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.260]   How the world works, there's principles of life.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.020]   And then in your picture in your mind,
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.020]   there should be you understanding yourself
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.620]   within this world, within how this world turns,
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.140]   you place yourself.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.060]   Well, by the perversion of the sin of man,
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.700]   one of the greatest things that we do in our sin is
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.100]   we become so huge in the box
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.220]   and God continues to diminish, right?
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.300]   That's a perversion and sin in our minds.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:33.260]   This question asks, who do you think you are?
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.620]   How big did you make yourself in this picture
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.100]   that you are now questioning God, right?
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.220]   How big do you think you are?
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.900]   Do you find yourself maybe thinking
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.260]   like you're one of the senators
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.940]   and he happens to be another senator
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.860]   and you wanna reason with him and be like,
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.700]   hey, let's make some bipartisan, dual, mutually,
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.100]   like synergistic policies here.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.340]   Why is it just all you, right?
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.500]   Maybe.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.900]   I don't think any of us would talk to God that way.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:09.500]   But by the questions itself, God says, wait a minute.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.740]   Who do you think you are, old man,
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.460]   who answers back to God?
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.340]   The thing molded will not say to the molder,
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.900]   why did you make me like this, will it?
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.420]   Or does not the potter have a right?
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.140]   Right there is where I meditated and thought,
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.540]   man, to us in our minds,
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.020]   we have to challenge ourselves to ask and think.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.940]   I know God has authority, he's God.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.980]   I know God has his right over us to do as he pleases.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.060]   He's God, right?
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.060]   And what's more, in synonymous terms, God's the creator.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.860]   He has so much power, he's so powerful.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.540]   He spoke and then it was.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.060]   He spoke and then it wasn't.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.460]   Like, he has so much power,
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.140]   he can execute things just by the word of his voice.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.820]   And then we're gonna talk back to God?
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.320]   No way.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.780]   And a way to think about this is,
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.580]   we know synonymously scripture talks about God
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.900]   as both maker, designer.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.540]   Here, he's saying potter, he is author.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.220]   And so in a kind of silly analogy,
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.900]   think about an author writing his novel.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.260]   He has a beautiful kind of interplay in his plot
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.220]   and he has obviously the villain, he has his hero,
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.620]   he even has the damsel in distress.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.300]   He has people in crisis moments
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.980]   and he has a peak in the drama,
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.460]   but all of a sudden, the villain's like,
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.980]   "Hey, wait a minute, I don't like this role.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.420]   Why do I always have to be the villain?"
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.100]   Right?
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.420]   And nowadays you have people trying to
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.820]   make different spoofs of movies.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.700]   In order to make sense of this,
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.220]   I'm trying to ask you this question.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.740]   In your mind, when it comes to authority,
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.820]   there are different types of authority that comes.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.460]   God has so much authority,
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.540]   he has every authority just from who he is,
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.940]   just from his abilities.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.740]   You know how we use the kind of term authority like this?
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.860]   If you happen to be the PhD holding expert in the room,
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.740]   you are the authority just based upon your knowledge.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:14.800]   Yes?
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.460]   God has that kind of authority.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:21.020]   You know, one of my favorite analogies
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.380]   to try to help us understand the chasm
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.020]   between creator, maker, author
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.780]   versus the creature trying to ask,
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.220]   "Why did you make me like this?"
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:30.720]   Right?
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.300]   Was a famous individual named Amos
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.060]   that Pastor Peter Chung likes to use.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:39.340]   Pastor Peter Chung likes to bring up this individual Amos
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.660]   and his last name is Amos Kitto.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.300]   So this is a little mosquito that he has
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.820]   and then I took it from his office.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.460]   It's a mosquito, okay?
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.700]   And I remember the reason why I love this
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.340]   because all of the analogies were spot on
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.860]   to spiritual reality.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.660]   A mosquito is already despised.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.140]   It's already condemned.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.500]   What do I mean by that?
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:05.260]   By the audacity of a mosquito entering into my presence,
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.060]   he must die.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.500]   If he comes into my room, right?
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.940]   Just his venture into my room deserves his death.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.340]   And nobody would tell me like,
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:16.140]   "What did you do?
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.860]   Why did you do that?"
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:17.900]   You know what you guys would do?
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.420]   You guys would be like, "Thank you so much."
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.500]   Right?
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.100]   If you were my family member
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.220]   and you were in my house,
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.700]   you would thank me for killing the mosquito
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.260]   because it becomes hostile to me.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.700]   And imagine if this mosquito had a voice
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.500]   and it says, "No."
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.640]   Right?
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.140]   You don't understand.
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.580]   I'm so poor.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.300]   I have no money.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.820]   I have no place to stay.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.100]   And I'm like, "Oh, really?"
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.940]   And I would kill it as it's begging me for mercy.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.000]   Why?
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.740]   Because it's a mosquito.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.260]   Okay.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.180]   But this analogy still fails
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.020]   to highlight the chasm between creator and creature.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.380]   Because this analogy is just between me,
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   a human being,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.460]   who is but one of billions,
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.260]   to a mosquito.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.640]   Right?
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.500]   The analogy that the scripture gives to us here
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.820]   is an inanimate object of clay.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.140]   And yes, that should automatically make us feel kind of like,
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.460]   "He's calling us dirt."
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:18.960]   You know?
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.540]   He's...
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.100]   We are.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.140]   We are but dust that returns to dust.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.300]   He formed us from the earth.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.140]   He formed us from the dust.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.100]   And he talks about...
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.940]   He talks about creation.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.220]   He talks about inhabitants.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.780]   You have no idea that God,
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.460]   when He sees inhabitants,
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:37.500]   it is but His creatures.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.340]   Yet at the same time, because of Him,
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.020]   because of who He is,
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.540]   He's graciously embedded on it value.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.380]   He's graciously embedded onto us,
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.900]   created us in His image.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.620]   And so it would be like me taking this mosquito
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.380]   and then saying, "I know I could kill you,
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.940]   but instead I will house you in my home.
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.820]   I want you to dwell with me.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.940]   And then I'll give you a name, Amos."
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.440]   Right?
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.700]   "And I will love you.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.820]   And you'll be with me forever and ever."
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:06.320]   Right?
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.580]   It's just so weird.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.580]   And so likewise, last week I said,
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.620]   "The question to us should be strikingly
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.140]   and painfully in our hearts,
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.460]   why does He choose even one?
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.180]   It's like saying,
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.860]   'I know I have dust on my feet.'
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.620]   Naturally speaking, He should have wiped it off.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.620]   But He saves the remnant.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.940]   He saves the few.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.860]   How dare we say,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.860]   "How can you not save everybody?
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.420]   Why don't you make your grace for everyone?
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.580]   How come these people are dying?
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.540]   Are you as gracious as you say you are?"
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.560]   You know?
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.180]   And He's saying, "You cannot do that
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.340]   because you don't understand
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.740]   the height of God and the lowness of man."
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:55.900]   And that's why God is able to say,
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.540]   even of us,
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.860]   just as a reference,
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.940]   Ecclesiastes chapter 5, verse 2,
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.660]   "Do not be quick with your mouth.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.020]   Do not even be hasty in your heart
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.700]   to utter anything before God.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.820]   God is in heaven and you are on earth,
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.540]   so let your words be few."
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.820]   Does that shock you as offensive?
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.220]   Definitely if you said that in our current culture,
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.820]   you're going to have somebody with sass,
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:22.380]   you know,
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.940]   sorry, I can't move my head like that.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.980]   You know, somebody who does,
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.460]   "Uh-uh, I will not be silent."
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.140]   You know, "You're going to hear me."
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.140]   I feel like that's our modern culture right now.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.220]   I have freedom of speech.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.580]   You know, "You can't silence me.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.700]   I have rights, you know."
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.220]   And God's in there, "Okay, yeah.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.100]   You and your wicked generation,
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.180]   you and your, you know, American culture, sure.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.420]   But when you come in my presence,
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.100]   I am in heaven."
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:55.500]   Like, we have to remember that.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.140]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.620]   We have to remember and appreciate His power.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.580]   And so what's more, what I'm saying,
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.580]   related to this idea of election then is,
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.940]   election is showing us this authority
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.700]   and this power that He's exercising
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.220]   and He's revealing to us.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.900]   We dare not try to even challenge that authority
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.220]   with words that I don't even know
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.420]   what I'm really talking about.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.020]   Because truthfully speaking,
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.980]   just the element of timing election,
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.580]   I don't fully comprehend.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.980]   You do realize that when God talks about your election,
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.180]   He says, "He seated you in the heavenlies in Christ.
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.660]   He's glorified you already."
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.300]   He talks about it like it's already done.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.060]   That's the power of God
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.500]   and His sovereign choice of you.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.020]   It's mind-blowingly powerful.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.140]   That's what I'm trying to say.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.740]   Point two, we must appreciate God's infinite power
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.420]   in His dominion, okay?
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.780]   We don't really use the term dominion a lot.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.580]   But the reason why I chose that term
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.820]   is because again, if you go back to our text,
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.540]   let's take a look.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.700]   It says, "So what if," okay?
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.540]   "What if," it's a hypothetical question,
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.700]   but He's using it to tell you,
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.260]   "Do you have any idea what God's trying to do?
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.300]   He's trying to show His power and glory."
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.260]   And then so He says,
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.020]   "He is willing to demonstrate His wrath
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.500]   and to make His power known."
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.580]   Earlier He said, "Do you have any idea
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.620]   how powerful God is?"
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:25.580]   Pharaoh of Egypt thought,
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:28.140]   "Oh my goodness, I'm Pharaoh.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.780]   Bow down to me," making statues of himself,
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:34.060]   like taking slaves, taking, as a ruler,
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.300]   taking slaves and making them his own,
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.300]   making people bow down to his idols
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.260]   and stuff like that.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.220]   And he's sitting there saying,
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.300]   "Who is God that I should listen to Him?"
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:42.800]   Right?
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.740]   And then God says, "You fool, I raised you up."
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.960]   Whoa.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.660]   "I raised you up to show my power."
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.540]   The term for power is the Greek word kratos,
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.540]   and it has lots of variation.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.220]   You know when Scripture talks about,
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.900]   "And Christ is the Almighty,"
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.420]   it's that word for power.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:02.700]   But what's really interesting is,
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.380]   if you look up the definition,
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.540]   yes, it means strength, it means might,
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.140]   but it says more specifically,
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.340]   this is in the dictionary,
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.100]   more specifically,
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.460]   "manifested power of dominion and control."
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.140]   There are different vocabularies,
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.340]   you know, synonyms,
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.820]   for power that's general power of presence,
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.700]   clout, aura, you know,
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.140]   like strength and might.
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.820]   There's different synonyms for that,
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.420]   but this specific term is more specifically used
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.300]   to the manifest power to execute.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.060]   And I want us to appreciate that and say,
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.940]   God is exercising His full control
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.420]   down to the precision,
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.700]   down to such a thoroughness of His salvation.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.380]   When we think about election,
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.980]   please, please do not think of it as God sat there,
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.860]   and then we were over there going,
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.780]   "Please let us in.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.220]   Please let us in."
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.100]   And then He decides,
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.140]   "Okay, is that election?"
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.980]   Or another way, again, I said,
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.860]   "Well, God does not, at least I want to save some."
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.540]   So He told His angels, like,
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.260]   "Go grab a few."
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.340]   Some people think of it that way.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.060]   They just like,
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.860]   "God is this high being that doesn't want to deal with us,
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.260]   sent His angels, sent His messengers,
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.300]   and says, 'Bring in a few,'
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.820]   especially the poor ones outside."
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.520]   No.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:27.660]   God exercises intricate, precise dominion.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:31.340]   He executes His will and purpose.
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.500]   That's the way Scripture talks about it.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:37.500]   In this passage,
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:42.380]   please take a look at Romans 9, 24.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:45.580]   When He starts quoting these passages,
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.540]   look at what He's saying.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:50.780]   He says, "Even among us whom He has called,
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.220]   not from among the Jews only,
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.300]   but also from the Gentiles,
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.140]   He says also in Hosea,
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:59.340]   'I will call those who are not My people, My people.'"
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.860]   Okay, so already He is exercising something
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.940]   that is a fulfillment of the promises,
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.660]   dating back all the way when God told Abraham,
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.100]   "I'm going to give you offspring.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.380]   I'm going to make you numerous.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.580]   I'm going to bless you with land.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:14.060]   And I'm going to make you a blessing to them."
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.620]   He already told them from long, long time ago,
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.140]   all that He was going to do.
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.700]   And He's executing it down to the T.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.220]   Starting from verse 27, He says,
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.940]   "Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.700]   'Will the number of the sons of Israel
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.380]   be like the sand of the sea?
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.460]   It is the remnant that will be saved.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.140]   For the Lord will," what?
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:36.140]   "Execute His words on earth thoroughly and quickly."
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:44.540]   I think, I really believe that subtly sometimes,
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.820]   we, because we don't see Him physically
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.260]   and we can't touch Him,
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.300]   and because with our eyes,
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.100]   we only see the day-to-day just moving forward,
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.860]   we see our God kind of like the way
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.540]   we see the King of England.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:01.580]   What do I mean by that?
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:05.180]   Who here even knows, like, who currently is the King?
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.740]   It's King Charles, okay?
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:10.380]   We get news on the sons and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.660]   And I'm like, "No, I don't like them."
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.540]   You know?
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.740]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:17.500]   In the old days, when it began with,
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.860]   you know, like back in the early thousands
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.420]   or whatever in England about who was like monarch king,
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.620]   their word was like gold.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.700]   It was almost as though God was speaking,
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.700]   and whatever they said, it happened, right?
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.060]   If they said, "You died," boom,
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.340]   they would be put to death, okay?
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:36.220]   But right now, what kind of power does King Charles have?
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:41.740]   Aside from, you know, the pomp and ceremonial stuff,
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.700]   aside from people gathering together
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.060]   and paying some homage,
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:48.140]   what kind of say and clout does he have?
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.980]   He's more representative.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.380]   He's more ceremonial, right?
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.580]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.860]   For us, we're like, "No, no, no.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.820]   "He exercises dominion as King
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:00.220]   "intricately involved in our lives."
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.020]   Yes?
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.140]   And I want us to make sure that
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.940]   if any of us have struggled to think about,
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:07.580]   "No, where is he?
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.020]   "Why does he allow this stuff to happen?"
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.460]   And we have these questions.
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:14.940]   Know that God is a God who exercises intricate dominion.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.500]   It says here, "Exactingly, thoroughly, swiftly."
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.780]   Point three, we have to appreciate God's power
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.020]   even in His wrath, okay?
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:29.340]   We have to appreciate and really accept
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.420]   and know God's power even in His wrath.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.300]   So one of the things that popped out to us
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:38.460]   was God saying, "You do realize that I am willing
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:41.340]   "and I have in the past and I will in the future
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.140]   "exercise my righteous judgment."
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:46.300]   That's power.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.060]   There are people right now in our day and age
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.340]   who are mad as can be.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.900]   They're raging, they're upset,
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:54.940]   and they have every right to be.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:57.100]   There are a lot of things that are going sour in our day.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:02.380]   But do you think that their crazy rants
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:06.220]   and the speed of their keyboard, brr, you know?
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.740]   That it's really gonna have a deep, deep effect
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.460]   on the trajectory of the way things are going?
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.100]   We see godlessness happening,
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.620]   we see things that are backwards,
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.820]   so many selfishness, tons of pride,
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:22.060]   lot of hate, lots of bitterness.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:26.140]   There are people who feel righteous but have no power.
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.220]   God, He says, "I am willing to demonstrate my wrath."
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.780]   When He says that, there's a righteous judgment.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.980]   And for that, we say, "Whoa."
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:41.580]   That is your power, that is your justice,
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.180]   that is your wrath, that's to your glory.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.940]   You know, last week I mentioned,
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:51.980]   if God, He says, "I have this choice
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:55.580]   "to make out of clay what I want to."
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.420]   And so from clay, I can make vessels
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.940]   for noble and useful purposes,
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.820]   or I can make it specifically for destruction.
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:07.020]   If He built clay discs so that He can shoot them
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.100]   and He can take a shotgun and then shoot them,
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.620]   shoot them, shoot them,
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.660]   would we sit there and be like,
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.540]   "What are you doing?"
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.460]   No, we would actually be impressed.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.460]   Wow, your accuracy is so good.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:22.060]   God's wrath is so exacting.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.420]   He says, "Do you know that every careless word,
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.860]   "everything you thought that nobody saw,
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:33.340]   "every thought that you raised up against God,
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.540]   "your fellow man, every hatred and bitter thought
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.020]   "that you had this murderous intent in your heart,
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.380]   "maybe you didn't act on it.
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:44.380]   "God says, 'Do you have any idea how precise my wrath is?'"
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.700]   And the thing about it is in Scripture,
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.380]   it makes us feel really awkward,
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.220]   but there are lots of portions of Scripture
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.460]   where the saints praise Him and say,
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:58.460]   "Glory to God, because this God is fully capable
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.340]   "and will be exacting in His punishment of the wicked.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.980]   "He won't let things slide.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.820]   "He's not a respecter of people."
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:07.260]   That is to God's glory,
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.540]   that is to God's glory,
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.420]   and it shows us His power.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:14.060]   But you know what else, what I was thinking about?
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:17.340]   This passage is interesting because he says,
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:19.900]   "So God is willing to demonstrate that wrath,
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.860]   "but He endures with patience."
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.980]   And then I asked myself, "What is He enduring?
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:28.540]   "Is He suffering at the hands of men?
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:33.100]   "God is ultra annoyed by the rebellious,
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.100]   "by the pagan people that have existed
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.540]   "all through the generations.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.700]   "What is He enduring?
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.140]   "In what way is He being patient?"
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:45.660]   And I remembered, you know, even of us,
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:49.020]   Scripture says in Proverbs 16
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:53.260]   that He who is able to exercise self-control
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.700]   has more power than those who control cities and kingdoms.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.000]   Why?
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.660]   Interesting question.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:03.340]   Who can stay God's hand?
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:06.300]   If God's about to come
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.220]   and He's about to exercise His judgment,
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.300]   who can be like, "Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.220]   "He's not ready yet."
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.100]   Something like that.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.380]   Who can go to God and be like,
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.060]   "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you have to wait."
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.020]   The answer is nobody.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:23.420]   God's power is shown in His patience
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:26.700]   because God is a God of incredible precision
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.220]   and self-control.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:31.900]   God is showing us His power through this
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.300]   in His patience, in His endurance,
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.780]   that although He could and He would be willing
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.740]   and although He had designed and had done in the past,
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.300]   that He will exercise His wrath and judgment,
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:46.700]   that He Himself will show powerful self-restraint.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.780]   And so finally, we must appreciate then
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.700]   His glory in all of this.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.540]   Okay?
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.820]   His glory in all of this.
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.740]   Today was just thinking through
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:01.740]   the fact that election was not meant to be for us
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.180]   like, "Huh?"
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.740]   "Wait, I don't get it."
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.420]   It's probably not true.
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:10.540]   I feel like some people approach it like that.
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.180]   Or, you know, some of us say,
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.100]   "Oh, you dummy, you don't want no election."
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.980]   Or just getting discouraged like,
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.540]   "Oh my gosh, I said today, maybe I'm not elected."
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:24.060]   That wasn't the purpose of how and why He showed it.
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:27.020]   The purpose I'm trying to tell you
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.020]   is He wanted to show us His glory.
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:33.340]   And so do you have any idea how powerful I am?
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:38.140]   And so I want us to turn to a passage in Daniel chapter 4.
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:39.260]   Turn your Bibles there.
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.220]   And we're going to read about Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:46.380]   Because Nebuchadnezzar had a realization.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:50.300]   He had one of those, you know, reckonings.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.260]   He had one of those, "Oh my goodness" moments.
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:57.180]   And he had a vision of the power of God.
[00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.380]   And he realized, "I must appreciate the glory of God
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.140]   because the reality is God is so powerful,
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.140]   I can't even describe it."
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.440]   Okay.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.500]   So go in your Bibles to Daniel chapter 4 verses 30.
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.140]   And King Nebuchadnezzar, as you know,
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.980]   his kingdom was huge.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.180]   King of Babylon, right?
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.620]   And what he says is the king reflected and he said,
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.500]   "Hoh, is not Babylon the great,
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.620]   which I myself have built as a royal residence
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:30.300]   by the might of my power for the glory of my majesty."
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.060]   Pause there for a moment.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.420]   That's some gross arrogance and pride, isn't it?
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.100]   But I'll tell you what,
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.060]   is that very, very far from what we're susceptible of?
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.900]   You know, I feel like for me, I get humbled.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.300]   There are times when I'm like,
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.900]   "Yeah, to be a pastor."
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.100]   I did. I took a vow like,
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.580]   "I'm going to be God's slave," for crying out loud.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.580]   "I don't need money. I don't need cars.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.780]   I don't need anything."
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:55.280]   You know?
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.740]   All I need is Christ and that's it.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.460]   And then there are moments when God,
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.300]   like prior to becoming a pastor,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.900]   I worked as a real estate agent.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.420]   I worked at a sales agent.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.460]   I worked at a, you know, electronics, excuse me,
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.660]   electronics company down here over at Ben Q.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.060]   And when I was a young man and I made my first, like,
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.700]   I guess you can say expendable cash, whatever,
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.900]   my arrogance showed in the way that I spent it.
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.380]   It was my money, I made it.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.020]   It's like, "Huh, I'm pretty good at this," you know?
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.860]   I actually think I would be pretty good in sales.
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:27.740]   I actually thought that, like,
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.980]   "If I put my mind to this, I can make probably a lot."
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:34.300]   Is it too far from us to say just simply,
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.140]   "This is mine because I did it.
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.500]   I'm the one who put in the time.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.700]   I'm the one who put in the energy.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.020]   I'm the one who put in the blood, sweat, and tears,
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.860]   and I put in my expertise into it."
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.300]   It's not so far.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.860]   But take a look at this in verse 31.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:50.460]   It says, "While the word was in the king's mouth,"
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.940]   Whoa, right?
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.500]   "While he was saying that stuff,"
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.340]   and he was just murmuring probably to himself,
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.460]   like, "This is great."
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.260]   "The voice came from heaven saying,
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.140]   'King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.060]   Sovereignty has been removed from you,
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.460]   and you will be driven away from mankind,
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.580]   and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.780]   You will be given grass to eat like cattle,
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.180]   and seven periods of time will pass over you
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.820]   until you recognize that the Most High
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.860]   is ruler over the realm of mankind
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.180]   and bestows it on whomever he wishes.'
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:31.740]   Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled,
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.660]   and he was driven away from mankind
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.300]   and began eating grass like cattle,
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.940]   and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.820]   until his hair had grown like eagles' feathers
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.140]   and his nails like birds' claws."
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:44.640]   Gross.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.740]   He looked like a beast, an animal.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.420]   His nails grew.
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.020]   He had to look like all, got all furry.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.180]   He was walking around.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.660]   He went from the highest palace to the field with the beasts.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.660]   But take a look at this in verse 34.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.340]   "But at the end of that period,
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.780]   I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven,
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.780]   and my reason returned for me.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.620]   I blessed the Lord Most High,
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.940]   praised and honored Him who lives forever."
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:13.580]   Why?
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:16.380]   "For His domain is the everlasting domain,
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.340]   and His kingdom is dures from generation to generation.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.260]   All the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing,
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:27.340]   but He does according to His will in the hosts of heaven
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.580]   and among the inhabitants of earth,
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.860]   and no one can ward off His hand or say to Him,
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.380]   'What have you done?'"
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.980]   Amen.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.460]   "From the mouth of a wicked king,
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.540]   mouth of a wicked ruler,
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:43.980]   God received glory for His power."
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.380]   And to us as Christians,
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.220]   this is at the beat of our heart.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.660]   I want to give glory to God.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.060]   I want to see His power.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:55.100]   And He says, "In your salvation, yes,
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.460]   by the power of God, so many mysteries.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.620]   How is it that I live today,
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.060]   but my life is now joined with Christ because of faith?
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.700]   How does two individuals' lives get merged together
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.540]   in such a mysterious and powerful way
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.780]   that the resurrected life is mine?
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.300]   I don't know."
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.480]   Right?
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.780]   How is it that my sins that I commit today,
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.380]   I can lay at the feet of the cross
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:22.380]   and it gets crucified upon Christ?
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.500]   How is it that He becomes our unrighteousness?
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.700]   I don't know.
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.580]   But Scripture says,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.180]   "By the working of His might,
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.220]   by the power of God,
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.940]   your life is secure."
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.180]   And then so He reveals to you
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.060]   even the very conception of it happening.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.380]   God predestined it.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.900]   You are chosen.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.340]   I pray that that would be encouraging to you.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.220]   That when you say,
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.460]   "I can't, I can't lose my salvation
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.460]   because that wasn't something I said
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.900]   that would be a great idea."
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.340]   No, God said,
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.980]   "I will give it to you."
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:04.220]   And so King Nebuchadnezzar in verse 37 says,
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.980]   "Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt,
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.260]   honor the King of heaven,
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.660]   for all His works are true.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.100]   His ways are just
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.940]   and is able to humble those who walk in pride."
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:19.660]   What God desires for us to do,
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.380]   the way that we're going to glorify God
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.540]   is through our humility.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.840]   Yes?
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.260]   It's through our humility of recognizing,
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.300]   "Lord, in you, everything.
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.700]   In me, nothing.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.820]   You literally told me verbatim,
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.980]   I can't do anything apart from you.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.580]   What am I doing?
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.460]   Why do I keep going to these things
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.820]   and turning to these people
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.820]   and trying to have, you know,
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.900]   cool things that I develop
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.420]   and I produce and I...
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:55.100]   No, Lord, I want to be humble before you.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:58.060]   You have marked out a path for me.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.420]   I want to be used for your kingdom.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.020]   I want to be used for your glory.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.420]   And the Lord of heaven has told me,
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.740]   He told me to preach
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.260]   because He has elected people.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.100]   He told me to go
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.940]   because there are people there that are His.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:12.560]   Amen.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.160]   Amen.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.260]   In humility, then,
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.740]   we're not going to be arrogant about our choices.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.020]   We're not even going to be arrogant
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.140]   about what we can produce.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.340]   Interestingly enough, in Romans chapter 11,
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.740]   when Apostle Paul is like concluding
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.660]   this little section about what about Israel,
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.940]   he tells the Gentiles, "Don't be arrogant."
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.860]   He says, "Don't be arrogant towards the branches.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.620]   Don't be arrogant as Israelites."
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.140]   We can't look back and say,
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.700]   "You know, these dummies."
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.260]   They're bowing to wood.
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.140]   They're bowing to Astropole.
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.420]   He says, "Don't be arrogant."
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.300]   This hardening, this partial hardening,
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.820]   I put a stupor over them.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.380]   You know why?
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.100]   So that you would receive mercy.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.100]   And then when you receive mercy,
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.820]   you know what I'm going to do?
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.780]   I'm going to be faithful to my exacting promise
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.780]   that I will save Israel.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.420]   That question of what about Israel
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:10.860]   is 100% God does not change His mind.
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.140]   It will happen.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.940]   Therefore, for you today, brothers and sisters,
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:18.860]   if any of you do struggle with assurance,
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:23.580]   don't look for answers just by staring at yourself.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.940]   Be like King Nebuchadnezzar, look up.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:31.500]   I looked upon heaven and realized God is the King.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:31.980]   Amen.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:36.060]   I want to conclude by saying the doctrine of election,
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.900]   I do not claim to know it all.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.740]   Huge question marks.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.980]   If you ask me, I'm just going to be like, "Hmm."
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:42.480]   You know?
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.460]   But look at this passage in Romans chapter 11,
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.580]   the way he ends it.
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:51.100]   Oh, the depth and riches,
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.820]   both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:57.500]   How unsearchable are His judgments,
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.100]   unfathomable His ways.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.140]   In this way, the acceptance of the doctrine of election,
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.380]   100%, very, very straightforward.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.820]   Oh, it's His.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.420]   It's His thought.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.380]   It's His mind.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.660]   It's inscrutable.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.340]   I'm not going to try.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.180]   He's given it to me.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.780]   Bless the Lord.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.260]   For who has known the mind of God
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.700]   or who became His counselor?
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.540]   Who has first given to Him
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:22.300]   that it might be paid back to Him again?
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:27.100]   For from Him, through Him, and to Him are all things.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.500]   To Him be the glory forever.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:29.980]   Amen.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:30.540]   Let's pray.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:36.060]   God, I pray that for us as your children,
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.260]   we would be so encouraged to know
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:44.060]   your power is so beyond our imagination.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:48.380]   Your way is so beyond our counsel.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.060]   And even if we wanted to hear an explanation from you,
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.020]   we know, God, that you are high in heaven
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.220]   and we are here on earth.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.620]   And so what we do, God, is to say,
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:01.100]   God, you're so powerful, we trust you.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.460]   You knew before that because you were the author,
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:07.820]   you wrote the end before the middle was even said.
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:10.540]   You wrote the beginning and the end, Lord.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.900]   And so, God, this day, we want to glorify you by saying,
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.740]   we trust you with all our hearts.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.060]   We trust you with every part of our lives.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.860]   There is no piece of us where we're wondering, God,
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.740]   what's going to happen?
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:22.540]   What's going to happen?
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:26.060]   But God, because we have you as our sovereign king,
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.900]   we are secure.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.180]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:29.680]   Amen.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:36.240]   -
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.800]   Let's rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:48.640]   Just one moment.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:10:01.200]   (gentle music)
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:19.760]   (gentle music)

[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.960]   God, truly as we sing just now,
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.760]   there is no one like you.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.860]   You are uniquely God.

[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.960]   that through the weak Lord, we'll be so convinced
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   you're the almighty,
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.460]   so that, God, we would not be tempted to do otherwise,

[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.860]   I pray, Father, that we would have deep security
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:26.760]   and conviction that we will trust you in our everyday walk,
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.760]   that we don't turn to our own devices
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.660]   and turn to the devices of the world.
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.560]   And I pray, Father, God, by us fully coming to you
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.860]   with full confidence and faith,
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:41.660]   Lord, we will show the world just how satisfying you are.
