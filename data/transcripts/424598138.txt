[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.360]   All right, again, we're eagerly anticipating for the church to come back, and I think if
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.080]   there's any, you know, one good thing that came out of all of this or is coming out of
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.280]   all of this is a greater thought about the corporate gathering of the church.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.640]   And I know because of the internet, many of the churches have been wrestling with the
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.440]   idea of going online and how to minister to people and reach out to people online.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.200]   But along with that came the challenge of the loss of the importance of the physical
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.800]   corporate gathering of the church, and more and more people have been just kind of nonchalantly
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.200]   taking the corporate gathering.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.120]   And I think this has at least caused the conversations to happen to take a deeper look into what
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.380]   the corporate worship really means.
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.680]   Why do we need to have to get together?
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.120]   What is the purpose of the Sabbath?
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.600]   What is the difference between having service in your own living room versus the physical
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.240]   gathering of the church?
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   And hopefully when we gather together, not only in our churches, but other churches,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.540]   that that may be restored and a high view of God and high view of worship may be restored
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.540]   in the churches.
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.920]   We're going to be jumping into Hebrews chapter 7 again, and I'm just going to read the first
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.240]   verse before we jump in this morning.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.120]   And I'm going to take some time, usually I don't talk about political things, but this
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.400]   morning I'm going to jump into a bit before we get into the text itself.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.600]   Because of many things that are going on around the world right now.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.640]   So let me read verse 1.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.720]   For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham as he
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.800]   was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.600]   Let's pray.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.480]   Father, we thank you so much for who you are.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.480]   None of us are worthy to call you Abba Father by our own merit.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.240]   We are here, Lord God, as sinners who are forgiven.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.080]   We are here, unworthy Lord God, to be in your presence.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.000]   And yet we come to your throne with boldness because of the blood of Christ.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.400]   I pray that that truth would convict us.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.440]   Renew our faith, renew our passion, renew our love, and whatever it is in our thoughts,
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   our emotions, in our lives, Lord, that we have been entangled with.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   I pray, Father God, that that truth may deliver us.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.480]   May our focus be you and you alone.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.740]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.080]   I think all of us know what's going on to a certain degree.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.800]   Some of you guys may be following what's going on in the news probably more closely than
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   other people.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.440]   And obviously we had the COVID-19 fear, which we're not out of the woods yet.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.240]   It seems like it is getting better.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.620]   But as a result of that, the churches have shut down.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.360]   Many people who are in businesses, some of you have been furloughed.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.800]   Maybe some people lost their jobs permanently.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.160]   And so there's a lot of stuff that's going on behind the scenes.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.480]   Politics, whose fault is it?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   Who did what was wrong?
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.720]   Who is doing right?
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.680]   And every day we have, especially in this country, we have two parties who are eager
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.040]   to blame each other and point fingers, thinking that maybe the solution is in their party.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.380]   We have financial crisis, international affairs.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.040]   We have issues with what's going on in China, with Iran, with North Korea.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.740]   There's problems going on even between China and India.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.840]   And so if you're watching the news carefully, it almost seems like it's just ready to blow.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   And then on top of all of that, you know very well what's been going on around us in Los
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.680]   Angeles and even in Irvine today, I heard news that there's going to be a protest happening
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.480]   at the civic center.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.280]   And so again, we want to caution you not to drive in that area because they have planned
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.160]   protests in that area.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.960]   What happened this week with the racial tensions, the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:23.280]   I think we've all seen videos, and I haven't talked to a single person who wasn't outraged
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.160]   of what they saw.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.720]   If what they are saying is true, it must stop.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.760]   Protests are a good thing, again, within reason.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.840]   We're not talking about like burning down buildings, but again, to make sure that some
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.960]   of these things that are happening, that policies need to be changed, there needs to be accountability.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.360]   And I think we are all in agreement with that.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.920]   But we must not conform to the pattern of this world.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.600]   Romans chapter 2, 12 verse 2, it says, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.720]   by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.560]   is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.520]   So when he's talking about not to conform to the pattern of this world, he's not simply
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.440]   talking about pornography and murder and killing.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.080]   It's just the way what we value, how we respond to things, how we react to things, that we
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.320]   don't react and think and implement things just like the world because our values are
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.540]   different.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.160]   What is important is different.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.080]   Our answer, what we believe to be the answer to human problem is different.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   Politics isn't going to solve it.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.100]   Just because you change laws, it doesn't change the heart of men.
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:53.400]   So this racial tension that has been simmering for years, probably decades, you know, it's
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.120]   beginning to explode.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.000]   Tinder has always been laying there, but what has happened in the last few weeks has basically
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.200]   put that into flames.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.760]   Let me make this very clear.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.120]   And there's a few things that I want to say about racism, and this isn't completely disconnected
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.560]   with what we need to talk about this morning about Melchizedek.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.880]   Racism is sickening.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.200]   Is sickening.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.400]   You know, I think all of us, to some degree, no matter what national background you're
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.640]   from may have experienced some of that, some more than others.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.200]   I remember when I first came to the United States, we were so excited because Korea was
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.680]   a third world country in the 70s.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.960]   And so we barely ate meat.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.360]   You know, I could remember a few times where we had candy, you know, at least that's what
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   I remember.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.440]   You know, eating fruit was a huge treat in the 70s.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.360]   And so coming to the United States basically meant that we thought we were coming to heaven
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.000]   on earth.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.760]   We moved, my parents moved to Philadelphia, and my earliest memories of Philadelphia was
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.440]   my parents working their tail off, coming home at 10, 11 p.m. at night.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.560]   And me and my brothers, basically, we were latchkey kids, you know, and my younger brother
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.040]   Phillip coming home, walking home from school when he was five years old and losing him
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   one day.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.860]   So, you know, all of these things are memories of my childhood.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.160]   And we also moved to Kansas.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.720]   And I remember being in Kansas, we were so weird in Kansas.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.320]   Not only were we the only Asians, we were the only minorities, period.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.820]   So we had three Asians in the school, me, my two brothers, and that was it.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.880]   And I remember back then, because she couldn't pronounce my Korean name, my teacher would
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.160]   actually call me China Boy.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.680]   And so it wasn't weird because it's like, oh, China Boy, I'm the only China Boy in the
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.040]   class, so she must be referring to me.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.200]   And again, as a third grade student, didn't think much about it, you know, that's just
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   the way it is.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.800]   And then we moved to Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.400]   In Atlanta, Georgia, in the South, in the 70s, I mean, racism was blatantly out in the
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   open, not just the teachers, but even the students.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.320]   And I remember every single day, somebody calling me chink.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.200]   And so, unlike my brothers, I didn't just absorb it.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.360]   So I got into fights, you know.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.600]   And so every day I went to school, I thought, maybe today I'm going to lose it.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.080]   So even to this day, I don't like wearing slippers outside.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.240]   Because mentally, mentally, even though those are decades and decades and decades ago, mentally,
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.680]   I think maybe something's going to happen today.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.400]   So I don't want to be wearing slippers.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.520]   Even though it's irrational, that's embedded, yes or no.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.040]   I don't like wearing slippers outside, right?
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.440]   For that reason, just in case something goes down.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.840]   When my parents decided to go back to Korea, I thought, okay, finally, we're going to go
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.720]   back to my home country where I belong.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.080]   Because clearly, I don't belong here.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.960]   And I was made very aware of that when I went back.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.880]   But I realized that I didn't belong there either.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.120]   That short time that I was here in the United States, about four or five years, I was Korean
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.120]   American.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   I wasn't Korean anymore.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.320]   And so I remember being in Korea, constantly being told to go back to my country.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   My country.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.320]   Where is my country?
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.400]   Because I thought I was in my country.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.720]   And that's when I realized that I didn't have one.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.560]   I didn't belong there, and I didn't belong here.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.200]   And right around that time, I was about 12, 13 years old, and going through an identity
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   crisis.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.240]   And when my parents decided to come back to the United States, I came back kicking and
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.440]   screaming because it wasn't going back to heaven on earth anymore.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.040]   I knew exactly where I was going back to.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.800]   I was going back to a place where I didn't belong, where I'm going to have to fight just
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.120]   to be a part of a school wherever my parents went to.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:57.400]   So even to this day, when I see racism, it reminds me of all of that.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:04.280]   And if there's one thing that I hate, one sin that I truly, truly hate, is racism.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.260]   Because it scarred me deeply when I was young.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.760]   But when I say that, I'm not talking about just anything.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.960]   Because sometimes the way that we call racism cheapens that sin of racism.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.520]   There's a difference between people being insensitive.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.280]   There is a huge difference between people being ignorant.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.260]   They don't have evil intent.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.880]   It's just that they haven't been around other people who are different than them.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.920]   And so they say things that they would say with their race or the people that they're
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.920]   familiar with, and they don't realize that this may be offensive to somebody else.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.560]   And I don't consider that racism.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   Not just being ignorant.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.440]   You know, oftentimes being very insensitive.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.200]   Racism is sickening at the core when it is true racism.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.840]   But racism is also universal.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.340]   It's not local.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.840]   Racism doesn't just exist in one group of people.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.000]   Because at the core of it, it's prejudice.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.400]   And every single one of us is prejudice.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:13.640]   So if I say Chinese people are, or Koreans are, black people are, Mexicans are, we have
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.400]   certain thoughts.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.160]   Some of us are careful not to express it.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.440]   But we all have certain thoughts.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.240]   People in Irvine are.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.760]   People in Santa Ana are.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.040]   People who are short are.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.400]   People who are big are.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.920]   We all have certain prejudices that we have inwardly, and we know how to temper that because
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.600]   we know how it will be perceived.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.240]   But at the core of prejudice, or racism, it's prejudice.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.400]   And every single one of us is guilty of that because the sin of prejudice resides in all
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   of us.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.480]   Because at the core of prejudice, we elevate ourselves above other people.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.640]   And at the core of human rebellion is wanting to have glory.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.320]   That's why we work hard to be better than other people, to get better jobs, to have
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.520]   better houses, to better career, better schools.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:12.360]   And all of that innately feeds into, if we're not careful, at the core root of our rebellion.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.800]   And prejudice is a byproduct of every human being that is trying hard to be better than
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.840]   other people.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.080]   It's just racism is just the fastest way to get there.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.440]   And that is not isolated in certain people, certain parts of the country.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.960]   It's everywhere, universal.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.080]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:42.000]   So I want to ask you to be careful to not to react to racism as if we are completely
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.120]   exempt.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:51.120]   That if we legislate and we get rid of those people, and if we isolate those people, that
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.160]   we will be free from prejudice.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.440]   Racism is in us.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.000]   And we have to be careful that in the way that we deal with racism, that we ourselves
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.800]   don't become racist.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.240]   That we don't just make blanket statements.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.360]   When somebody says white people are racist, that's also racism.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.820]   When those people are like this, that's also racism.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.520]   So we need to be very careful and precise.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.120]   You know, one of the things that I noticed of, again, doing church ministry for so many
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:33.080]   years is that people come to church, and if they have a bad experience with a few people,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:39.400]   they will leave the church and they will say, "Berlin Community Church is like this."
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.320]   And if you sit and talk to them, usually it's because they've had a bad experience with
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.720]   one or two people.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.520]   But our tendency is when we're hurt, when something negative happens to us, we're not
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.160]   precise with our criticism.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.900]   We usually throw bombs.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.240]   Just kind of like what's happening with the riots.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.600]   Why are they burning down buildings?
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.720]   Why are they looting people, especially in their own neighborhood?
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.720]   But we have a tendency, when we're angry about something, when we're hurt and we feel injustice,
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.200]   our tendency is to throw bombs.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.440]   We don't have to participate in riots physically to be rioting in our hearts.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.120]   Because when we're hurt, our natural tendency is to, they're like this, even between husband
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   and wives.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   When we're angry, we don't say, "Why don't you help me with dishes?"
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.040]   We say, "How come you never help?
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.600]   How come you're always like this?"
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.920]   Because that is our natural tendency.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.000]   When we are upset and when we're hurt, we have a tendency to throw bombs.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.560]   So we need to be careful that in the way that we deal with racism, that we ourselves don't
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.760]   do more damage than good.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:57.360]   But fourth and finally, racism, the answer to racism is always Jesus, is regeneration.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.260]   Because at the root of racism is our human rebellion.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.920]   At the root of racism is our sin.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   And so as much as we want to cry out and say, "We don't want what happened to that black
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   brother.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   From what I heard, he was a Christian."
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.560]   To ever allow that to happen again.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:30.600]   That in our protest, I pray that the Christians will see the proclamation of the gospel as
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.920]   more important.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.540]   That we don't just simply point out what is bad.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.240]   That we don't just get outraged and say, "If we just change the law, if we just lock up
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.120]   a few people, this would be a better society."
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.080]   You and I are here because we believe that that is not the case.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.120]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:57.880]   Police department, Asians, blacks, whites, Hispanics, all have sinned and fall short
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.480]   of the glory of God.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.560]   Democrats, Republicans, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.400]   Americans, Chinese, Korean, Indians, Mexicans, all have sinned and fall short of the glory
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.200]   of God.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:19.560]   So the only remedy to sin that you and I believe is a regeneration that happens by the blood
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.880]   of Christ.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:30.320]   So before we pour so much energy into changing the politics, again, I think we live in a
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.400]   free country where they give us the right to vote, right to protest, and so when we
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.480]   see evil, we should point that out.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.500]   But in the process of pointing evil, that we make sure that we give the remedy along
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.540]   with pointing out the evil.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.960]   That the remedy is Christ and Christ alone.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:57.160]   You know, dealing with racism is very tricky, especially if you faced racism before.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:04.920]   I remember years ago, I had an African-American friend who I was driving around town and I
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.960]   was in Buena Park.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.240]   And he was sitting to my right and I was driving around, we were trying to look for something
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.680]   and I got pulled over by the police.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.720]   And when we got pulled over, I was like, I wasn't speeding, you know, and I, or at least
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.160]   I didn't think I was, so what did I do wrong this time?
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.720]   So they pulled us over and they told my friend, his name was Michael, to get out of the car.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.280]   And again, he was an African-American brother.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.520]   He went out and I was sitting in the car and a police officer came over to me and asked
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.520]   me, are you doing okay?
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.200]   And I said, yeah.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.760]   So what's this about?
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.860]   He's like, okay, we just have to ask some questions.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.240]   So they had a list of questions that they asked him.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.720]   Then I got out of the car, I said, because I began to realize what was happening.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.400]   And so I got out of the car and I said, officer, did I do something wrong?
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.760]   He said, no, no, no, no, no, we just wanted to double check.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.840]   And I asked him, what are you double checking?
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.080]   I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.640]   So I said, what do you mean?
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.760]   He said, don't worry about it.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.760]   And then asked him a few questions.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.760]   He said, okay, you can go.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.680]   And then we got back into the car.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.400]   And so I realized the only reason that we were pulled over was because he was black
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.920]   and I was Asian and maybe it fit some profile.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.320]   Maybe there was some report or they were looking for somebody.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.280]   And I asked Michael, Michael, does that happen to you often?
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.920]   And he said, I'm used to it.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920]   That's what he said.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.600]   Now, again, I'm also a minority, right?
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.400]   But I don't experience that.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.080]   So he just kind of blew it off as like, I'm just used to it.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   And he didn't make much of it.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.920]   I was upset for him.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:49.440]   And I was also very confused because the officers pulled us over for my protection.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.360]   They were doing their job.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.640]   They pulled me over because their duty is to protect.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.160]   And they thought maybe if this is not, maybe it fits some profile.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.440]   And then they really was trying to protect me.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.500]   So in one sense, I was thankful that they were doing their job, but I was also upset
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.720]   because of my friend.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:23.640]   Problem with racism isn't black and white because it's not about policy.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:30.920]   It's not about changing programs and getting rid of certain people.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.560]   But all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.360]   The answer is not that simple, at least in the eyes of the world.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:46.040]   You think, oh, if we can get Republicans to run four more years, we'll have a great country.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   If we can get the Democrats in office, things will get so much better.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.880]   That is the lie that Satan tells year after year after year after year.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.960]   And if you live long enough, you know, like the politicians that come and give all these
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.600]   promises, these are all promises.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.320]   And if you've been watching politics, following for any period of time, you know that the
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.080]   politicians are not as powerful as they think.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.640]   Now what does this have to do with the passage that we're looking at?
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.880]   The letter that is written to the Hebrews are drifting back to their old life because
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.600]   they took their eyes off of Christ and whatever problems that they were having in life, they
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.000]   thought it would be easier if they can just go back to the majority, if they went back
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.800]   to Judaism.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.120]   And they weren't outright doing it.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.580]   They were just kind of drifting back because that was the easiest path to take.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.480]   And so the author is reminding them to be anchored in Christ.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.820]   Have you forgotten your confession?
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.920]   Have you forgotten why you come to worship?
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:57.160]   Have you forgotten that Christ and Christ alone is your refuge?
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.860]   He's the only one who can change our hearts.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.660]   No amount of hard work, no amount of discipline, no amount of discipleship is going to weed
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.800]   the sin that has corrupted our very being.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.920]   That's why Jesus said to Nicodemus, "You must be born again."
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.640]   He didn't say, "You need to work harder.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.720]   You need to go to the temple.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.880]   You need to memorize more of the Old Testament."
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.440]   He said, "No, everything that you've done until you are born again is useless."
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.760]   "Well, how can a man be born again?
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.060]   How do I do that?"
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.060]   You can't.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.240]   It's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.120]   Where he comes, where he goes, no one knows.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   He's like the wind.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.880]   In other words, we're completely helpless.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.840]   We're completely helpless until Christ comes and saves us.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:53.460]   And so that's the underlying tone of the whole book of Hebrews, to not to drift, to be anchored
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.740]   in Christ so that we would look to Him and not to run to the world.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.200]   That's why he says in Hebrews 7.4, "Observe how great this man was to whom Abraham the
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.980]   patriarch gave a tenth of the choice's spoils."
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.480]   Observe means to intently look.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.640]   And obviously, he's not saying to look at Melchizedek.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.800]   He's saying to look at Melchizedek because Christ comes in the order of Melchizedek.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.920]   Again, at the tail end of the book of Hebrews 12, you can say that summary of everything
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.160]   that he's been trying to say in chapter 12, verse 2, says, "Fix our eyes on Jesus, the
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.440]   author and the perfecter of our faith."
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.440]   Not only is he the one who begins our faith, he's the one who's going to continue to sanctify
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.120]   us.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.080]   You don't just begin with Christ and end with hard work.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.360]   You don't just begin by grace and then end with work.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.760]   He says, "No, it is by grace you are saved.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.000]   It is by grace you are sanctified.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.200]   It is by grace that you will be glorified."
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:02.480]   So it humbles us that we are always desperate, whether you've been a Christian for one year,
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.760]   whether you've been a faithful Christian for 40 years.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:13.040]   Until the day we die, we meet Christ, we are all desperately in need of Christ.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.360]   He says, "Christ is different than the other kings.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.040]   Christ is different than the other priests.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.720]   Because he is a king priest."
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.800]   Now king priest doesn't sound like much, but if you know the Old Testament, it was prohibited
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   for kings to be priests.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:37.480]   Malchus in 7.1, it says, "Malchus is the king of Salem, priest of the Most High God."
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.240]   God prohibited the kings of Israel to be priests, and the priests were not able to be kings.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.160]   And there's a specific reason for that.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.040]   See, the kings of Israel had limited power.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.020]   They're not like other kings.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:55.440]   So if you were the king of Egypt, if you were the king of Babylon, king basically meant
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.760]   that you created the law.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.000]   In fact, if anybody is immune to the law, it would have been the king because the king
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   creates it.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.240]   If you broke the law, you can say, "Well, today that's the rule."
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.600]   King of Israel did not have that kind of authority because there was a king above that king.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.680]   And God made that very clear to the nation of Israel.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:21.220]   Deuteronomy 17, verse 14 to 20, God was preparing the nation of Israel to get into the Promised
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:28.100]   Land, and He foretold that when you get in, one of your primary problems that you're going
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.540]   to run into is that you're going to put your hopes on the kings.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.380]   So He gives them restrictions.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.980]   Verse 14 to 20, "When you enter the land which the Lord your God gives you, and you possess
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.460]   it and live in it, and you say, 'I will set a king over me like all the nations who are
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.460]   around me.'"
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.700]   In other words, they were looking for leadership.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.700]   We want what they have.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:56.720]   And He says, "You shall surely set king over you whom the Lord your God chooses.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.940]   Even the one you choose," He said, "No, I will choose him, one from among your countrymen
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.180]   who shall set as king over yourselves.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.900]   You may not put a foreigner over yourself who is not your countryman."
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.580]   So even the selection of the king, God Himself said He's going to do it.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.780]   In other words, there's a God above this king.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:20.180]   Secondly, verse 16 and 17, "He shall not multiply horses for himself, nor shall he cause the
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:25.020]   people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, since the Lord has said to you, 'You shall
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.260]   not again return that way.'
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.460]   He shall not multiply wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away, nor shall he
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.260]   greatly increase silver and gold for himself."
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.780]   Let me stop right there.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.420]   Well what's the benefit of being a king?
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.260]   I mean you would think that if you're the king of the world, king of the country, of
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.900]   course you're going to have wealth beyond everybody else.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.060]   But God says, "You will not multiply your wife.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.580]   You will not multiply the horses."
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:26:02.780]   So this king was, in a sense, he was an under shepherd because it didn't belong to him.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.620]   I mean, what king?
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.820]   What king has these kind of restrictions?
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.260]   If you're the king, you're the owner of the palace.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.340]   If you're the king, you're the owner of every possession in that land.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:20.540]   But he said to the king of Israel, "You shall not have many horses, or silver, or gold."
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.420]   So you know, people often ask, you know, look at King Solomon.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.660]   He had many wives and God was not pleased with him.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:35.020]   You have to be careful that we don't extrapolate things that are happening in narratives and
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.580]   say, "Well, God is okay with it."
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.340]   No, God clearly spelled out, "He is not okay with it."
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.940]   And part of Solomon's sin was he went astray and he disobeyed God.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.100]   He goes on in verse 18, "Now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of the kingdom,
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.580]   he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.620]   priests."
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.940]   So even the law itself, the king didn't create the laws.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.140]   God gave him the laws.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.380]   So he couldn't will himself.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.940]   He had to be chosen.
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.900]   He couldn't get many wives or he couldn't become wealthy for himself.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.260]   And even the law, he couldn't create the laws.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.980]   God would give him the laws.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.760]   This doesn't even sound like a king.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.300]   But he said the nation of Israel, "Because you're asking for a king."
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:31.060]   He said, "I'm going to give a king to you, but this king is going to be an under shepherd."
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:36.860]   And then verse 20, "The reason for all of this is that his heart may not be lifted up
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.720]   above his countrymen."
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.260]   Think about that statement.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:50.020]   So that the king may remain humble like the rest of the subjects.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.660]   The king.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.940]   So that the king of Israel will not become proud and he thinks that he is somehow better
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.500]   than the subjects.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.260]   Compare that to any other king.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.940]   Even the king of the smallest country in the world.
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.180]   Even the most insignificant, a country that you've never heard of.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.860]   If you say he's the king of that country, you would automatically assume he's the richest
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.860]   guy.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.860]   He's the most powerful guy.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.620]   He's the most honored guy.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.660]   And yet the kingdom of Israel, he says, "So that your heart may not be lifted above his
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.460]   countrymen and that he may not turn aside from the commandments to the right or to the
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:36.740]   left so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel."
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:44.540]   So Israelites kingdom was unlike any other kingdom because there was only one true king.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:51.100]   And all the other kings in Israel's history were supposed to represent the true king.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.660]   And God put limitations on them.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:29:00.060]   And one of the limitations that he put is that the king could not be a priest.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:06.780]   He is not, he wasn't allowed to occupy both offices.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.940]   We see in 1 Samuel chapter 13, King Saul breaks that commandment and as a result of that,
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.720]   he loses his kingdom.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.020]   We also see that in 2 Chronicles chapter 26.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:24.160]   King Uzziah, King Uzziah becomes a great king.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:30.280]   And as a result of that, of all of his accomplishment, it says in chapter 26 verse 16 that he became
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.400]   powerful and that when he became powerful, he became proud.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:40.140]   And as a result of this pride, he said his kingdom was going to be lost.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.140]   Just like he said.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:48.300]   In fact, we see a clear picture of what kind of king Israelites had in 2 Samuel chapter 12.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.620]   Remember King David?
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.180]   He commits this horrendous sin.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.180]   He commits adultery.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.560]   He takes someone else's wife and in order to cover that up, he murders him.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.660]   This is a man after God's own heart.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:09.900]   Now in any other nation, any other king, that would have been perfectly fine.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.780]   As outrageous as that may be, who's going to contest him?
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:15.780]   Who's going to call him out?
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.560]   He's the king.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.180]   He could just come out and say, "You're my wife today," and that's it.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.500]   Because he makes the laws.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.740]   All the wives are going to be my wives.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.020]   Who's going to say anything?
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.420]   He's the king.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.740]   He could take their land.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.660]   He could take their wives because he's the most powerful.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:39.140]   But in the nation of Israel, the kings were not like the other nations.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:44.980]   That's why when the prophet Nathan comes and confronts him about his sin in 2 Samuel chapter
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:54.020]   12, David couldn't do anything other than repent because he recognized his sin.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:59.220]   And what's interesting about the way he repents is Psalm 51 verse 34 says, "For I know my
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.740]   transgressions and my sin is ever before me."
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.500]   Because he knew that there was a king above him.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.660]   "But you and you only, I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight."
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:18.560]   Now that seems like a completely immoral thing to say because he committed adultery.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.420]   He killed a man who was faithful to him.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:27.060]   And yet when he repents, he says, "You only, I have sinned and done what is evil."
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.860]   What are you talking about?
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.300]   You sinned against your kingdom.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.900]   You sinned against Bathsheba.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.980]   You sinned against her husband.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.740]   What do you mean, "You only, I have sinned"?
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.420]   Now he's not saying that I'm innocent of his blood, I'm innocent of adultery.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.260]   He's not saying that.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:55.340]   But as the king of Israel, the only law that he broke is God's law because he was the king.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.860]   And that's why he was saying, "I've broken your law."
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:07.260]   As a king, I could do whatever I want, but as the king of Israel, I've sinned against
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.260]   you.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:13.740]   See, Israelites' kings were not like any other kings.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.980]   God establishes kingdom.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:22.340]   God established kingship and authority even in the secular world for the purpose of carrying
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.660]   out punishment for evil.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.940]   That's what it says in Romans chapter 13.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.780]   And that's why we are called to submit to those who are in authority.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:34.340]   See, the priesthood was given in order to reconcile sinners to God.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.980]   So the kings were to carry out the law.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.220]   They couldn't create the law, but they were to carry out the law that God gave them.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:47.060]   The priests existed so that when they broke the law, that there would be a remedy.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.380]   And God said that these two offices cannot come together.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.420]   Now why is that?
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.260]   Why did God do that?
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.060]   Now I'm going to get to that in a minute.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:05.300]   But Jesus fulfills what he prohibited in the nation of Israel because the kings were under
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.780]   shepherds and the priests were also under shepherds.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:16.180]   And he kept these two things separate because it was reserved for Jesus and Jesus alone.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:21.660]   So when he says Jesus comes in the priesthood of Melchizedek, he's saying that Jesus is
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:29.860]   also king and priest, which was not allowed in the nation of Israel.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.060]   When Jesus came and he said, "I did not come to abolish the law, but I came to fulfill
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.060]   the law."
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.540]   To fulfill the law means two things.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.720]   One, he obeyed it completely.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.900]   Whatever God told him to do, he did it completely.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.780]   But secondly, what it means to fulfill is to take it to completion.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:51.260]   That whatever God gave him the law, what his intent was, he said it pointed to him.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:58.460]   And so he came to fulfill the prophecy that your Messiah is going to come as a king priest.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.460]   So Jesus came to fulfill that law.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:05.420]   In Zechariah 6.13, "Yes, it is he who will build the temple of the Lord and he who will
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.540]   bear the honor and sit and rule on his throne."
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.140]   In other words, he's going to be the king.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:17.900]   "Thus he will be a priest on his throne, which other kings were punished for doing, but he
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.060]   said your Messiah is going to come as a priest on his throne."
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.900]   And the council of the peace will be between the two offices.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.060]   In other words, he says when the Messiah has come, he's going to bring those two offices
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.740]   together.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:34.740]   The only other place Melchizedek is mentioned in Psalm 110 verse 4, "The Lord has sworn
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.100]   and will not change his mind.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:42.740]   You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:49.100]   Now why is this so significant?
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:55.700]   And I think hopefully this will help out.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:05.180]   Imagine if Jesus was just king and his role is to carry out justice.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.420]   Where would you and I be?
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:15.700]   We wouldn't be here because we all broke the law.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:22.360]   So if Jesus is king of kings and Lord of lords, you and I would be crushed.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.360]   We have no opportunity.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.420]   It is not a throne of grace that we approach.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.020]   It's just the throne.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:34.860]   And when you approach the throne, a God who is holy, holy, holy, just like everything
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:39.020]   in the tabernacle said, if you come with any sin, if you're tainted in any way, if there's
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:45.940]   any disobedience in you, you will be consumed by my holy wrath.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:52.380]   If Jesus was only king, you and I have no hope.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.160]   But he's not just king.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:02.140]   He embraced priesthood and the purpose of priesthood was to reconcile sinners to God.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:08.460]   But if priests, priests never, they didn't carry out the punishment.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.580]   Priests did that because they were the ones who were in authority.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.060]   The priests were always receiving the gifts and to reconcile.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.060]   We're all reconciled.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.940]   Your sins are forgiven.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:23.540]   Now if Jesus was only priest, which many people forget that he is also king and we only see
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:31.760]   him as a mediator who's always mediating for us, one saved, always saved, and our sins
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.480]   are always forgiven.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:40.560]   It doesn't matter what we do because all we see him as is a priest.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.040]   And so because only see him as a priest, there is no lordship.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.920]   It's not necessary because they don't know him as king.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:57.040]   The Bible tells us that Jesus Christ came to fulfill that office that was reserved for
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.160]   him and him alone.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.600]   He was king priest and he was king priest perfectly.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.840]   In Psalm 110 verses 1-4, the Lord says to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.280]   your enemies a footstool for your feet.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.440]   The Lord will stretch forth your strong scepter from Zion saying, 'Rule in the midst of your
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.440]   enemies.'"
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.080]   In other words, you're going to be established as the king.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.120]   "Your people will volunteer freely in the day of your power."
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:34.240]   In other words, your kingship, you're not going to rule in fear.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.440]   You're not going to rule in judgment.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.720]   You're not going to carry out justice because you're going to slap them.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.480]   He said, "They're going to come to you because you're also the priest."
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.000]   And he said, "They're going to offer up worship to you freely."
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.160]   So his kingdom is unlike any other kingdom.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.940]   He's not just a king, he's also the priest.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:59.600]   And the way he reconciled us to himself, he's absorbed our sins upon him before he sat on
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   his throne.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:07.100]   You know, I heard a great illustration this week about what happens.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:13.240]   In order to make something clean, you have to make something unclean.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.680]   Just like we're trying to sanitize everything and in order to do that, we have to pick up
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.680]   a rag.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.300]   And you don't use dirty rags if you want to clean things.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:26.020]   You take a clean rag and then you take the dirty surface and then you wipe it down.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:31.200]   And so when you wipe it down, the surface becomes clean, but where's the dirt?
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.140]   It's on the rag.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:40.740]   So the rag that was clean is made unclean in order to make the surface clean.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:48.800]   The Bible describes our priest king in order to make us righteous so that we may dwell
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.440]   in his kingdom.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.260]   He absorbed our sins upon himself.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:00.560]   He who knew no sin became sin so that you and I may become the righteousness of God.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.420]   That is his kingdom.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:08.980]   Imagine why this king-priest office is so important.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.540]   This may not be a perfect illustration, but imagine.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.780]   Imagine if you got into trouble, right?
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:23.740]   Somebody got into trouble and you got taken to jail and the public defender comes and
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:28.180]   he wants to have a conversation with you and then somebody whispers in your ear and he
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.300]   says, "Hey, he's also the DA."
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:37.540]   Now you're confused.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.700]   He's a public defender because public defender, I'm supposed to tell him what's going on so
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.740]   that he could defend me.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.400]   DA is my enemy.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.820]   If I tell him all my sins, I'm going to go to jail for a long time.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:57.140]   But the guy who's defending me is also the DA.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.540]   Now they will never let that happen.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:08.700]   They will never let that happen because those two offices are contradicting because no human
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:15.180]   being can carry out the public defense and DA at the same time because we're going to
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.500]   be prejudiced in one way or the other.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.140]   Either you're not going to do a good job as a DA and say, "You know what?
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:28.180]   I'm going to pretend like I never heard your sin and I'm just going to defend you and I'm
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.180]   going to do a great job.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.380]   I'm going to let you go."
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:36.020]   Or you're a public defender and I heard all your sins.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.840]   You told me everything.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:47.700]   No human being is able to be a public defender and DA at the same time.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:57.860]   Only a being who has perfect judgment, who has perfect knowledge, who himself is not
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:06.360]   tainted with prejudice himself, who is able to carry out perfect justice and perfect grace
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.840]   at the same time.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:14.760]   And there is no human being that can ever be in that role.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:20.840]   That's why it was prohibited for kings and the priests that those two offices would mix
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.760]   because no human being can carry that out.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.280]   Only Jesus.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:32.480]   Only Jesus can carry that out perfectly.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:44.480]   A holy, holy, holy God who knows all things, who judges all things, loves us unconditionally
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.680]   because of the love of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   His blood covers us.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.780]   That's the king that we worship.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.480]   That's the mediator that stands before us.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:08.640]   Our DA, our public defender is the same person.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.560]   Where he doesn't sweep our sins under the rug, he doesn't allow chaos to happen, he
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.920]   doesn't tolerate the sin.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:23.340]   The kingdom that we are headed to is not anarchy where people do whatever they want.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:30.840]   There is order, there is righteousness, but there's also peace, there's also grace.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:38.160]   Because we have a king who comes in the order of Melchizedek.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:44.760]   Why would we want to drift and replace him with anything else?
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.040]   Why would we want to go to any other kingdom?
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:54.180]   Why would we put our confidence in any other leader, in any other mediator?
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.500]   That's the point that he's trying to get to.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:02.420]   And that's why this is the meat of Hebrews.
