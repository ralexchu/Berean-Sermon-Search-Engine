[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I'll be reading from verse 8 to verse 25.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Philemon, verse 8 through 25.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   E reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   "Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   I, Paul, an old man, and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   during my imprisonment for the gospel.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   But I prefer to do nothing without your consent, in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   but of your own accord.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a beloved brother,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   If he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it, to say nothing of your owing me your own self.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I will be graciously given to you.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Let's pray.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Heavenly Father, we entrust this time to you.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   We pray, Father God, that your words that go forth would not be empty,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   but your Holy Spirit would convict us.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart. Renew us.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Remind us, Lord God, what it is that we have in Christ,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that our lives may simply be a reasonable response.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So we entrust this time to you, Lord God, asking for the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   to continue to convict and renew. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   As we've been talking about, you know, hearing and seeing the testimony of the power of the cross,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   it really never gets old. In fact, if it ever gets old, it already tells us something has gone wrong in us.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You know, we hear the testimonies of how other people became Christians
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   and how they're following Christ, even in their struggles.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Because whenever we hear people's testimonies, it's not just about their testimony.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It's a story that all of us are involved. So if we're somehow disengaged with that,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   again, that's a warning sign that something has severely gone wrong in our hearts.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Philemon is a powerful testimony of what happens to people when they meet Christ.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   To think that a former runaway slave will be restored back to his master.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Again, you know, we have to take time to really consider what does that mean?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   What does it mean for Onesimus to return back to his master?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   If this didn't go well, if Paul told Onesimus to go back and be restored to Philemon,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and Philemon says, "No, I can't do that." You know, think about my reputation.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I don't know if Philemon still owns slaves, but if I just forgive this guy,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   what's going to prevent these other slaves from taking off?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   What are the other people in this city going to think of me?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And so, I mean, you can think of all kinds of reasons why Philemon might say
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   that may not be a good idea. And if that wasn't, what would happen to this runaway slave,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   now a Christian who's coming back with this letter?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   You know, typically, a runaway slave who was caught, at the minimum,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   they were brutally flogged as a punishment. They were often branded.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   They were sold for hard labor, saying, "I can't trust you anymore."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So they would send him, and he would be a tainted worker, so he would only be able
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   to work in the field for hard labor as a punishment.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Oftentimes, they would actually be crucified. They would consider him tainted.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   "How can I trust you over my farm or over my property if I can't trust you?"
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So they would basically extinguish him. So oftentimes, runaway slaves were crucified
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   or thrown to the wild beast. And typically, according to historical documents,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   that they were forced to wear iron collars, which read, "Catch me, I'm a runaway slave,"
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   just in case. That you branded him, and you forced him to wear a collar,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and he would stand out everywhere he went. So think about the consequence of
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   this man going back. And so everyone was taking a risk. Paul was risking his
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   friendship for asking this. Philemon was risking his reputation,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   maybe his own property. And Onesimus was risking his own life to come back.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I mean, think about it. He ran away from slavery to find freedom,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and now he's going back to the very place that could possibly ruin his life.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   You know, as Christians, as we know and study about the testimony of Philemon
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and what this letter represents, as we talked about before, forgiveness is at the
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   core of Christianity. Before we think about how we ought to live, and evangelizing,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and Great Commission, the beginning of our relationship and ongoing relationship
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   with Christ is about forgiveness. It's because you and I have been forgiven by Christ.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   It's because God continues to forgive us in our weakness, and He will continue to
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   forgive us, to sanctify us until the end, that we are able to be here and to
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   worship God. None of us today, no matter how well you did your quiet time, no
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   matter how much scripture you read, can ever come into the presence of God by
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   our own merit. It's only because His work on the cross was permanent. So forgiveness
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   is at the core. In fact, the scripture tells us if we do not practice
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   forgiveness, there's consequences. In Mark 6, 14-15, He says, "If we want our sins
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   forgiven, when we come to God and ask for forgiveness, you must first forgive."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Matthew 6, 14, "For if you forgive others their trespasses, your Heavenly Father
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive other trespasses, neither will
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   your Father forgive your trespasses." I mean, you can't be more clear than that.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Right? Our ability to be able to come before God and ask for forgiveness is
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   contingent upon our willingness to forgive others. In fact, if we don't
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   forgive, it says our very worship will not be accepted in Matthew 5, 23. So if
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   you are offering your gift at the altar and there, remember that your brother has
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   something against you. Leave your gift there before the altar and go first be
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. So He says, "Even our
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   very worship and offering that we give to God," He says, "first go and be
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   reconciled." It hinders even our prayers. Mark chapter 11, 25, "And whenever you
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   stand praying, forgive. If you have anything against anyone, so that your
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Father also who is in Heaven may forgive you your trespasses." We have all these
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   things that the Scripture commands and tells us that it is absolutely essential
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   that Christians practice forgiveness. But the fourth and final thing that the
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Scripture gives us about forgiveness is forgiveness is ultimately, vengeance
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   ultimately is the Lord's, He says. Romans 12, 18, "If possible, so far as it depends
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourself, but leave it to
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   the wrath of God, for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,' says the
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Lord." So in other words, He's saying the vengeance and the carrying out of justice
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   and judgment, that's what God does. No matter how justified we believe we are,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   He said, everything that we carry out, our justice and our desire for vengeance is
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   always tainted by our own sin. Our own selfishness, our own pride affects proper
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   judgment. That's why He says, "Vengeance is mine." On the contrary, it says in verse
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   20, "If your enemy is hungry, feed him." He's not just talking about a stranger.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   He's talking about an enemy, somebody who has offended you, somebody who has wronged
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   you. He said, "On the contrary, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him something to
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   drink. For by so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head." In other words,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   win him over with your kindness. That he may desire to hurt you, but you're going
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   to reverse this curse by being kind to him. So what he means by putting burning
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   coals on his head, meaning that he just put him in a situation where he can't do
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   anything else. He said, "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Paul says, he says, "As an apostle of Jesus Christ, I have the boldness to command
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   you in the name of Jesus." You know, when Paul calls himself an apostle, it's not
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   like the general meaning of the word apostle basically means a messenger. But
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   that's not how Paul uses the word. When Paul calls himself an apostle, he's
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   talking about a unique gifting, unique calling that was given to a very few
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   group of people. Now, there's a debate as to whether that's 13 to 12 plus apostle
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Paul, or some debate maybe Barnabas was an apostle. So, whether you believe
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   there's 12 or 14 or maybe even 15, that office does not exist today. These were
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   uniquely gifted, anointed people that God used for that particular period to give
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   us revelation of the Scripture, to be the first witnesses of Christ. So, when Paul
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   says in his letters, he begins the letters by saying, "I, an apostle of Jesus
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Christ." He's not just saying, "I'm just a messenger like everybody else." He's
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   uniquely saying, "This letter comes to you with authority." Romans, 1st, 2nd
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, 1st, 2nd Timothy, Titus, all
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   of these letters have a stamp of his authority. And so when he starts his
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   letter he's basically saying, "You need to pay attention to this. I'm not just
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   speaking as a man. I'm not just speaking as a messenger who has a message for
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   you. I'm speaking with the authority of Jesus Christ. And you need to listen to
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   this as if Jesus Himself is speaking to you." And that's why he puts that stamp,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   "I, an apostle of Jesus Christ." You know, today, if you were to receive a
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   letter, you know, certain letters come with more authority than others, right?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   If you receive a letter from, you know, some clearing house, something, and you
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   won a lottery, and please contact us in the next five minutes or you're not
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   going to get it, it's like junk mail, right? Or, you know, "Oh, you're trying to
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   refinance your house? Come, contact now. The interest rate's going to go up
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   tomorrow, so contact us." Junk mail, right? But it's stamped with IRS, right?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   IRS, Internal Revenue Service to Peter Kim. Now, that doesn't go on a junk mail,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   right? Maybe some of you who haven't been paying taxes for a long period of
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   time, because like, "Ah, IRS, whatever." You do not mess with the IRS, right?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Because people go to jail for going to, messing around with the IRS. The IRS can
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   actually tap into your bank account. Did you know that? The money that you put
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   in, they can take out, like that, right? In fact, like I said, people have gone to
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   jail for not, for neglecting the IRS. So, when a letter comes with the IRS, with
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   the stamped IRS, you open it, whatever it has to say, and you pay very close
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   attention to what he said, what they say, and you have to reply to it. You say,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   "We need these documents. We need to verify this." You don't just put that over
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   there, "Ah, whatever," right? Because behind the stamp of the IRS, the US
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   government stands behind them with all their power and authority. So, when Paul
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   calls himself an Apostle, he's not just saying, "Yeah, I get the title, I'm just a
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   messenger here." He said, "No, I'm coming to you with the authority of Jesus
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Christ." In fact, he says in Ephesians 4:11 that the Church was founded upon the
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Apostles. The Gospel ministry was first and foremost was given to the Apostles.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   His authority. In fact, here he says, "I could speak to you with the authority of
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   an Apostle and command you to do this." And it's not like he hasn't before. In
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   fact, often times you see him coming with that authority, because he needed to. In
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   1 Timothy 1:20 he says, "Hand over Him and Alexander to Satan, that they may
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   learn not to blaspheme." Remember, the Apostles actually had authority to
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   raise people from the dead and actually carry out capital punishment. I mean, we
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   don't have Apostles today, so you and I are safe. I don't have that authority.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Nobody here has that authority. But the Apostles did. Remember Ananias and
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Sapphira? Because they blasphemed the Holy Spirit, they lied to the Church. And
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Apostle Peter basically carries out capital punishment right there. The
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Apostles had that kind of authority. And that's why he says to Timothy to set
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   these guys apart. So we're going to teach them not to blaspheme. 1 Corinthians 4
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   20-21, "For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power. What do you
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   wish? Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and spirit of gentleness?"
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Apostle Paul historically was known to be a short, skinny, bald guy. You know?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And that's why he says his letters are impressive, but his presence is weak.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Right? Because there's nothing intimidating about this guy. He doesn't
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   have a booming voice. He's just a small, petite guy. So when he says, "Shall I
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   come with you with a rod?" You know, it's like, "Come on, Paul. We can take you."
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   You know what I mean? It's only two minutes to take you down, put you in an
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   armbar, and tap out. You know what I mean? That's not escape. Paul is not talking
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   about his physical presence. He's not saying he's been working out and check
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   out his muscles, and I'm going to flex it on you. Right? He's talking about his
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   apostolic authority. That if I come there and you do not repent of your sins, I
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   may have to come to you with a rod. So again, it wasn't like Paul didn't flex
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   his muscles before. There are times when he did do that. In fact, the Scripture
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   gives us many examples where the Apostles tell us, "You are obligated. You
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   are obligated to be obedient to Christ. You are obligated to follow Him." In fact,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   there's warnings. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a holy God. In
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   fact, there are, you know, encouragements of rewards. That great reward is
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   waiting. The crown of life is waiting for you if you persevere and endure.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Oftentimes, we're told and we're commanded to fear, to live out our
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Christian life in fear and trembling. So, the Scripture doesn't give us just one
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   motivation. You know, some people have a tendency to think that if we're not
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   motivated by love, that everything else is legalism. That is not true. Because
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   that's what the Scripture says. There are times when Paul flexes his muscles.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Paul, Peter, John, they all flex their muscles and say, "You need to do this
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   whether you want to do this or not, because there are serious consequences if
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   you do not." But the primary motive, it is not the only motive, but the primary
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   motive is always love. That's why Paul describes in 1 Thessalonians 1:3, he says,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   "I remember your response, your genuine response to the gospel. I remember your
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   work of faith, but your labor of love." Steadfastness is hope in Lord Jesus
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Christ. He said, "Of the three virtues of Christianity, of faith, love, and hope, out
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   of these three, what is the greatest? It's love." Not only is it the greatest, he
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   says in 1 Corinthians 13, that if you have all these other things, if you give
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   your body even to be burned, even if you're martyred, he said, "If you don't
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   have love," he says, "it is nothing." It is not the only motivation, but by far it is
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   the greatest motivation. So Paul, instead of commanding him, is really giving him
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   an opportunity. He could command him, and now if Philemon doesn't obey, for the
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   sake of Onesimus, he may say, "You know what, if you're not going to obey, I'm
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   going to command you in the name of Jesus Christ. But before I need to get there,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   I'm going to tell you, I'm going to give you an opportunity to respond in grace."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   So how does he come out? He appeals in his weakness. Look at verse 8 and 9. He
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   said, "Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   required, yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you, I, Paul, an old man, and
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   now a prisoner for Christ Jesus." So his first appeal is in his weakness. I'm not
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   coming to you with this great authority. I'm not coming to you with this power.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I'm coming to you as an old man sitting in prison and appealing to you in love.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Why? So that you would not respond in compulsion. In 2 Corinthians 12:10, it
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   says, "For the sake of Christ, and I am content with weakness, insults,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   hardships, persecution, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong."
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   You know, if there's any one particular lesson that I have learned in ministry,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   and I believe that Apostle Paul, at the end of his life, if there's any one
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   lesson that he probably learned over and over and over again, is that the greatest
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   obstacle in bearing fruit is always us. And we tend to think if the church is
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   this way, if the community is this way, if the organization is this way, if we
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   have more of this, more of that, but it's always us. That's why Paul, so many
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   great things were happening to him, but God deliberately slows him down. God
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   deliberately humbles him, where he's begging the Lord three separate times,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   "Take this away from me." He says, "No. I did that on purpose to keep you
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   humble. That my grace should be sufficient for you." In other words, that
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   my grace is enough for you. It is not your ability. It is not your power. It is
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   not your backing. I mean, think about Apostle Paul. You know, humanly speaking,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   this guy had personal connections. He had personal friends in the Sanhedrin. I
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   mean, if somebody in that position became a Christian, wouldn't you
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   automatically think, "Man, that's a great resource. You know, all of these guys,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   you know, they're chasing us, and they're putting us in prison. Why don't you
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   talk to some of your friends?" And Paul could have said, "Okay, let me use my
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   influence." Here's a guy with a Roman citizenship. I mean, this guy, it was
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   privileged. He had family backing. He has finances. And yet God allowed him to
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   experience, you know, having plenty and not having enough. I mean, here's a guy
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   who may have already been sitting in the Sanhedrin making tents to make ends
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.420]   And here he says, "For the sake of Christ, I am content with my insults and hardships
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:33.600]   and persecutions, calamities; because it is when I am weak, He is strong.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.580]   It is when we are weak, when we recognize our weakness" you know, whenever somebody
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.520]   says "I've done this and I've done this and I've done this and I experienced this and
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.840]   I've seen this and I learned this immediately, that's the biggest obstacle in that person's
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:54.160]   life, because they think that somehow they're more effective because of their past experience.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.640]   The greatest lesson I believe in ministry, whether it's Apostle Paul or us or myself,
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.920]   is recognizing that I am the biggest obstacle.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:09.080]   It is when I am abiding in Christ, when I am depending upon Him, He is the greatest.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:15.560]   Paul appeals not to his authority, but to his humility.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.680]   I mean, if you really think about it, what attracted you to Christ?
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.360]   And what continues to attract you to Him now?
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.040]   How many of you became a Christian because you were walking down the street and saw the
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:32.400]   magnificent of, how the mountains were so magnificent and you looked at the universe
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.120]   and how vast it was and you looked at all of that and said, "I want to worship this
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   God."
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.560]   Some of you, maybe, I've never heard that yet before, you know, maybe some of you, I'm
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.360]   not saying it can't happen.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:51.200]   From my personal experience and from counseling people, majority of you, and I'll be even
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:59.000]   bold to say maybe all of you, were attracted to a God who humbled Himself.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.760]   We were attracted to His weakness.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.560]   In fact, isn't that what the Scripture says, that Jesus Christ forsook everything and He
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.580]   became a humble servant?
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.040]   He learned obedience through suffering.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:16.680]   He became a sympathetic high priest so that we would recognize that in His weakness, that
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:22.280]   we can come to Him, that we may be able to come to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.300]   And He didn't draw us with His power.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.640]   He drew us in His humility.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.000]   And even to this day, what is the greatest attraction of Christ?
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.900]   Yes, we understand He's an omnipotent God.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.000]   We understand that He is an all-powerful, omniscient God.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.240]   He is immutable.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.480]   All of these things are true.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:49.680]   But what is the greatest attraction of Christianity?
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.640]   It's Jesus on the cross.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.600]   This Almighty God who was equal with God in every way, did not consider equality with
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.600]   God something to be grasped, and He humbled Himself and became nothing.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.960]   It is in His humility He brought life.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.480]   It is in His sacrifice that He reversed the curse.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:17.920]   And so Paul here appeals in his weakness that you would recognize this opportunity that
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.600]   God's given you.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:26.060]   Secondly, he appeals as a son, as a father to the son, and as a brother to brother.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.400]   As a family, he doesn't just say, "Hey, here's this runaway slave that's coming to you."
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.280]   He says, "No, he's my son in the faith.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.960]   I've become his father."
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:39.440]   And to see him not simply as a runaway slave, but as your brother who's being restored to
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   you.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.920]   And that's exactly how the Bible paints the picture about the church.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:52.020]   We call it the temple, we call it the body of Christ, and all of these things are true.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:58.640]   But in the end, the picture that we are given in the church is that we are family of God.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.760]   And that's what Paul says in 1 Timothy 1, 5, 1 and 2.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:09.880]   Do not rebuke an older man, but encourage him as you would a father.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.920]   Treat younger men like brothers, older women like mothers, younger women like sisters,
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.520]   in all purity.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.560]   If we see ourselves as a, you know, this is a church and we have so many people, and this
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.320]   is my brother, but that person, like, you know, just brother in name.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.280]   Think about it in, if you were in the early church, the word brother was not created by
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.600]   Christians to call other Christians.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.800]   That was like today.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.320]   If we said, "That's a brother," we use it in various ways, right?
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.600]   It's a, you know, a lot of times we think of it as, "Oh, Christian.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   He's a brother.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600]   He's another Christian."
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.780]   But in the early church, when they used the term brother, it just meant family.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.420]   And I think that's exactly how it was being used.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.580]   That my brother, my mother, my father was my other Christians.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.780]   Imagine if you're in a, if you're in a home and I, you know, I have four kids and my oldest
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.260]   comes in and says, "You know what?
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.820]   Isaiah, I love Isaiah.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.220]   You know, he's like a puppy in our house.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.220]   I love him.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.780]   He's my brother.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.620]   But these other two, they don't listen, so they're not my brother."
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.760]   Right?
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.020]   Imagine if he said that.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:21.340]   It's like, from a parent's perspective, a parent is never at peace until all of the children
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.340]   are safe.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.340]   Right?
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.660]   You don't have to have all of them missing.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.060]   All you need is one.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.060]   Right?
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.380]   If one is not home and he's not in bed, I'm never completely at peace.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.100]   And see, from God's perspective, He said, "We're his children.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.420]   We're part of his family."
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.140]   When he says, "He's my brother," there's automatically, what he is saying is, "He's somebody that
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.340]   you need to care for.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.180]   He's not just an ex-runaway slave."
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.860]   You know, when I was in high school, I had various groups of friends.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.340]   I had some jock friends, and I had some fob friends.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.340]   Right?
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.940]   And then I had some Hispanic friends.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.300]   And those, to be honest, those are the guys that I felt the closest bond to.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:06.740]   I felt culturally, I don't know what it was, but there was a connection with these guys.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.740]   Right?
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:13.460]   And, you know, this is during, I was at Burbank High School at that time, and this was during
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.500]   a period when there aren't too many Asians.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.460]   So Asians typically have to kind of find your little niche.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.540]   And that was the group that I felt the most comfortable with.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.580]   And so whenever I would hang out with them, you know, the other guys would say, "Hey,
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.020]   what's this chinito, what is he doing here?"
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.380]   And then usually one of my friends, one of my Hispanic friends would say, "Oh, don't
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.260]   worry, Peter's a homeboy."
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.260]   That's what he would say.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.260]   Right?
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.940]   And I don't know if they use it the same way today, but at that time, when they said, "He's
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.140]   a homeboy," basically it meant, "He's one of us.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.140]   You can trust him."
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.380]   Like, "I vouch for this guy."
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.580]   And so when they call me homeboy, that means I can hang out with them.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.940]   That means if somebody causes me trouble, we're going to back this guy up.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.700]   And that's probably one of the reasons why I like this group.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.700]   These guys stuck together.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.860]   I mean, basically, if somebody jumps you, he's jumping all of us.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.900]   That was kind of like the community.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.780]   They had a tight-knit community, and I was a homeboy.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.780]   And that's what it meant.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:21.140]   That term, at least at that time, if you were called a homeboy, no one messed with you.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.180]   Because behind him, everybody else is like, "No, you don't mess with that guy.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.180]   He's a homeboy."
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.180]   Right?
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.140]   The term "brother," again, we use it kind of generically.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.340]   Like, "Oh, everybody who's a Christian, everybody who professes to be a follower of Christ,
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.340]   he's a brother."
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.780]   But imagine in the early church when they used that term.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.740]   He's saying, "That's my sister.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.740]   That's my father.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.740]   I became his father.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.740]   He became my son."
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.780]   In other words, he's using illustration as a family.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.580]   And that's exactly what Paul says in Philemon 15.16.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:54.260]   "For this, perhaps, is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:59.700]   forever, no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.700]   to me.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.260]   But how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.900]   See, what you lost was a slave.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.620]   But now you're getting back a brother.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.740]   And not to see him that way.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.860]   So Paul is trying to see him in a larger context and picture.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.900]   You're receiving something much better than what you lost.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:20.900]   At one point he was useless.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.100]   Now he's going to be very useful to you in the greater work.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:29.260]   Not just to take care of your farm, but your very household.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.100]   He's going to come to you as a brother.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:38.300]   You know, as a pastor, one of the things that I have to do, and as leaders in the church,
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.940]   is we have to sometimes discipline.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.180]   We have to say things that we don't want to say.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.260]   We have to point out sins that we don't want to, because the easiest thing to do is just
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.740]   kind of sweep it under the rug, because I don't want to deal with it.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.740]   You know?
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.460]   Sometimes, a lot of times people will come up to me, "Hey, this person's doing this and
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.460]   this and this."
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.460]   Deal with it.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.460]   Right?
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.780]   Well, that's one of the dirty jobs of being a leader.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:05.420]   And again, this is not, it shouldn't be just a job of the leadership, but you know.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.460]   And so whenever that happens, I have to caution my own heart.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:15.900]   How much of this, how much of this righteousness that I feel, or this I need to carry out,
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.860]   would I do that if that was my own son?
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.900]   And that's how I measure my own heart.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.340]   Would I speak of him in that way if that was my own kid?
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.340]   If that was my wife?
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.220]   If that was my husband?
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.180]   My mom?
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.180]   Or my brothers?
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.620]   Okay?
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:39.140]   That's how I measure if I am actually practicing, say, "Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.980]   So sometimes I don't even know, you know, what's happening in my heart.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.140]   And I would measure it that way.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.540]   Well, I picture my son in that situation.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.540]   Would I say that?
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.820]   Would I do that to him if that was him?
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.260]   And I would have to measure my own heart.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.740]   And that's how I am able to see.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.900]   It's like, okay, if I'm not, then that means I need to be on my knees and pray.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.300]   I'm not ready to confront that person because I'm not doing it in love and grace.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.580]   I want to hurt that person.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.580]   Or we're hurt.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:11.820]   We want to, you know, retaliate because that's our natural, you know, disposition.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.340]   And that's why Paul says, "I'm coming to you to see."
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.540]   I'm not asking a slave and a former slave owner to be reconciled.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.460]   I'm asking a brother to be reconciled with a brother.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:27.740]   And I'm asking as a spiritual father to be gracious to my son.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.580]   And that's, in reality, that's how God sees all of us.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.780]   He's not just a person in the church or a person in our lives.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.780]   He says, "No, it's your brother.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.380]   That's your sister."
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.580]   It's because sometimes we don't see them that way.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.420]   We just see them as an inconvenient person that's in our lives.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.700]   But it's like, "No, would I do that if that was my brother?
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.420]   Would I do that if that was my sister?
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.660]   Would I do that if that was my mother or my father?"
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:58.420]   Thirdly, ultimately, he's appealing in love.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.420]   He's appealing in love.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.340]   The greatest appeal in the Scripture is love.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.780]   He says, "So that you wouldn't do this out of compulsion, but out of free will."
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.140]   In NIV, it says, "Spontaneous and not forced."
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.740]   And then in the ESV, it says, "For this, not under compulsion."
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:26.500]   Look at that.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   Not under compulsion, but to do it out of your desire.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:35.460]   You know, if you look in Scripture, Old Testament, there was mandatory gifts and free will gifts,
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.860]   free will offering.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.860]   Mandatory offerings in the Old Testament was satisfied in Christ.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.100]   What is necessary for us to come to Christ was satisfied in Christ.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.420]   But the Old Testament also has free will offering, where you just, out of desire, say, "You
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.420]   know what?
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.980]   I want to give this to God."
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.980]   Best worship is always done out of our desire.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.580]   When we are moved, right?
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.140]   When we do things out of compulsion, we always just do the minimum, right?
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.820]   If you come to worship in compulsion, you're very calculating the time.
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.820]   You know, it's like, how long is the worship?
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.540]   You know, start at 11, usually ends about 1230.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.060]   So we start at 12, people don't get there.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.140]   You know, we start music, so I'll show up about 12, you know, 11, 15, 11, 10.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.660]   I won't miss anything, as long as I get the sermon, right?
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:28.220]   And then if my sermon goes a little bit long, it's usually about 45 minutes, you know, where
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.060]   I should shoot for 45 minutes.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.060]   Sometimes it goes longer.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.060]   I know what you're thinking.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.900]   No, a lot of times it goes longer.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.900]   Okay.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   I heard you.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.900]   I heard you.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.900]   Okay.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.180]   If it goes a little bit longer, you know, I hear the grumbling.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.180]   It's like, "Dang, it went long today."
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.180]   Right?
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:50.460]   Because I've given you one hour and a half, and you took an hour, you know, 40 minutes.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.300]   How dare you?
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.900]   When we give worship out of compulsion, it's always measured.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.740]   You know, I do quiet time, and it's like, "Oh, I read three verses," or I put 10 minutes,
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.860]   or even the way we pray, you know, it's like, "Oh," I said, "I'm going to pray 10 minutes."
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.380]   And we're all like, "10 minutes?"
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.380]   You know?
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.380]   "Five minutes?"
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.380]   You know?
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.180]   And then you say some things, and five minutes and 10 seconds, and then you say some things,
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.180]   and you're always measuring.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.860]   Like, "I got to put in my 10 minutes."
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.860]   Right?
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:16.860]   Even, even the offering.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.860]   Like, "Oh, I got 10 percent."
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.580]   It's like, "How much is 10 percent of whatever?"
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.580]   Right?
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.340]   And then once you give that, it's like, "I've given.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.820]   I've given.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.180]   I've given my, it's like, there's nothing more, and like, I've given it to you."
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.180]   Right?
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:36.300]   When we're doing out of compulsion, it's always just, just what you need to do.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.620]   But true worship is when we are moved.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.180]   When we are inspired by His sacrifice, by what He's done for us.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.060]   And we give.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:52.180]   You know, I think the greatest example of that that I've seen, you know, years ago,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:58.340]   I went to Romania, because China had SARS, and we were forced to go to Romania last minute.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.980]   And we went to these Baptist churches to do presentations.
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.860]   And I remember, you know, Pastor Aaron's wife, Tina, she prepared all these, like, body worship
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.500]   skits and all this stuff, and found out that the churches in Romania were very offended
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.940]   by it.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.940]   You know?
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.260]   That they're so conservative that, you know, I remember the very first time that we did
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.980]   the body worship presentation, I was in the back, because they didn't want me in the team.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.140]   So I was in the back, and they were doing all this stuff.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.020]   And then we saw people crying, you know, one particular lady crying in the back.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.740]   So I thought, "Wow, they're being moved."
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.740]   You know?
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.740]   That's what I thought.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.700]   Then after it was over, I went to an interpreter and asked him, and he was very reluctant to
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.060]   share with me what she was saying.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.860]   But I said, "Hey, what's going on?
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.060]   It seemed like she really liked it."
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.860]   And he's like, "No."
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.340]   She was saying in Romanian, "What kind of a church is this that allowed this kind of
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.180]   stuff on the stage?"
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.300]   And I didn't share this with our team, because I didn't want to ruin the trip, because that
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.140]   was the first church we went to.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:00.060]   And then every church that we went to, we realized that they were so, like, so rigid
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.260]   that - one time we got yelled at because we were supposed to do a special presentation
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.340]   singing songs, and some of our guys forgot the lyrics, and they were giggling.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.340]   Because they forgot.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.460]   They were embarrassed.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.500]   And then the pastor got so mad at us and said, "How can you be so irreverent?"
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   You know?
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.740]   And crack a smile up there.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:23.460]   And I was like, "Oh my gosh, you know, I don't think we're coming back here again."
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.540]   But I remember going through that just so discouraged.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.620]   These guys are so seeped in legalism that there was no true worship.
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.220]   There's no joy in their face when they worship.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.660]   It was just, "You're supposed to do this, you're supposed to do this, you're supposed
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.380]   to do that."
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.580]   And then one day we went to a gypsy church.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:43.460]   And gypsies were kind of looked down upon, and they always kind of had the worst building
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.780]   because they just traveled from place to place, and they just had a bad reputation.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.620]   And we went to a gypsy place, and they said, you know, as a pastor, they said, "Prepare
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:55.300]   a sermon, you know, but the worship structure is kind of loose, and they just allow people
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.380]   to share and stuff, so just be prepared.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.540]   When we're ready, we'll ask you to share the message."
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.620]   So we went in, there was a group of maybe about 30 people, and there was probably about
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.040]   eight or nine of us that went together.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.820]   And then we're sitting there, and the pastor just started out, sang some songs, and said,
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.880]   "Anybody here want to share?"
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.140]   And so one by one, just the congregation members would share, and then they would share about
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.140]   their stories.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.980]   And because Romania's economy is so bad, you know, you don't see a lot of young men.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.420]   Like our church age people, you just don't see.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.860]   All the young men who are able to work, they're all outside the country.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:31.920]   So you had older ladies, older men, and young children everywhere we went.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.260]   And so one by one, these ladies would be standing up, and they were sharing, like, you know,
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.460]   they, the husband had to leave, haven't seen him in five years, and how difficult it is,
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.460]   and how they came to church and heard the gospel, became a Christian.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.980]   And so one lady would share her faith and sit down, and then another lady would stand
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.780]   up, and she would begin to share and start weeping.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.460]   And so every one of them had just gut-wrenching testimonies.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.140]   And obviously, every one of us was being affected by this, and so, you know, our team started
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.580]   standing up and saying, "Oh, man, we're so blessed by this.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.580]   We're so blessed by this."
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:05.020]   And then at the end, in the context of doing this, there was a non-Christian who stood
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.020]   up and said, "You know what?
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.460]   I've been coming, you know, for a few weeks, and I'm hearing your testimonies, and I really
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.940]   feel like, you know, everything that you're saying, I believe this, and I want to become
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.940]   a Christian."
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.220]   So a lady just accepted Christ.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.460]   You know, there was no preaching, there was no altar calls.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.220]   It's in the context of worship and giving testimonies.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:31.700]   Every single one of us, we came out of that worship thinking like, "That's worship.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.700]   That's true worship."
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:39.140]   You know, when people were affected, you see the effects of the cross in those people,
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.300]   just eager to say, "I love Jesus.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.780]   I want to proclaim Him."
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.260]   And it's not like, "Man, I'm a Christian.
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.260]   I should do this.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.140]   I should do that."
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:55.620]   The greatest motivation, the greatest appeal of Christianity is always His grace.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.620]   It's always His love.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.620]   That's right.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:03.020]   In 2 Corinthians 8, 1 and 4, Paul talks about the churches in Macedonia, and how there was
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.100]   a famine in Jerusalem, and he was taking an offering, and these churches in Macedonia,
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.420]   they themselves were experiencing famine.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.100]   But Paul says, you know, let me just read to you what he says.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.580]   He says, "We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.740]   the churches of Macedonia.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:25.140]   For in a sort of severe test of affliction," he's talking about them, the Macedonian church,
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:31.460]   "their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.820]   on their part."
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.820]   So did you hear that?
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.260]   They're not giving because they were blessed and they had so much left over.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:43.660]   He said, "In their severe testing of affliction, in extreme poverty," right?
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.820]   Extreme poverty.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.620]   I don't care how poor you were when you grew up.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.780]   I don't think there's a single person here that has ever experienced extreme poverty.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.840]   Extreme poverty means you can't feed your kids.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.600]   They can't eat.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.740]   They get a cut.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.740]   There's no antibiotics.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.740]   There's nothing.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.740]   No medical attention.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.180]   That's what, if you've ever traveled outside of the United States, you know what extreme
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.300]   poverty may look like.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:11.420]   He says, "In their extreme poverty, they have overflowed in wealth of generosity."
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.420]   Even though they were poor physically, they were wealthy in spirit.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.940]   And it says in verse 3, "For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:24.300]   their means, of their own free will."
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.140]   They weren't coerced.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.860]   They weren't commanded.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.580]   They didn't, they weren't given a guilt trip.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.780]   They actually begged, he says in verse 4, "Begging us earnestly for the favor of taking
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.660]   part in the relief of the saints."
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:44.220]   That's what worship looks like when it is not under compulsion.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.460]   That's what evangelism looks like.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.020]   I mean, some of you guys remember when you first became Christian, how eager you were
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.100]   to share the gospel with people?
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.540]   It wasn't a mandate.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.900]   It wasn't because you heard a sermon.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.500]   I remember that so clearly.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.500]   The very first, I mean, Andy shared that this morning, but the very first thought that I
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:09.580]   had when I met Christ is like, "Man, all those people, my brothers, you know, all my
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:16.140]   friends, everybody that I knew, they need to know this too."
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.740]   This is what worship looks like when it's not under compulsion.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.940]   That's why Hosea 6.6, it says, "For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.940]   of God, rather than burnt offering."
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.780]   That's why Paul says, "I have the authority to command you, but I appeal to you as an
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:38.460]   old man, as a prisoner, to consider my son in the faith, your brother in Christ.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:43.580]   You may have been calculating what it costs to lose a slave, but you're not thinking about
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.100]   the gain of a brother.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.100]   Consider him your brother.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:53.220]   If he's a gain to me, if he's become useful to me, how much more to you?"
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:59.980]   Lord in Goliath, what a testimony it would be for people to see this is what happens
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:08.380]   when a curse is reversed between a slave and a slave owner, a Pharisee, a tax collector,
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.380]   a former prostitute.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:15.020]   This is what it looks like when the curse is reversed and a community of people are
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:21.060]   living not under compulsion, but in reasonable response.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.780]   We don't know what happened to Philemon.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.340]   We don't know what happened to Onesimus, at least not in this letter.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:32.500]   Now all of, everything we know about church history isn't 100% accurate, but there are
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:37.820]   records that we can rely on that tells us what happened, at least the history behind
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.420]   what happened after this letter.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.860]   Philemon becomes a pastor at Colossae.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.600]   Now we don't know a whole lot more about that other than the fact that we have letters and
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.340]   documents that claim that he was a pastor at Colossae, which is where he is, where the
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.020]   church is now.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.500]   So he became respected, he became the leader of this community in Colossae.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   Ophelia, his wife, we have records that she was martyred for her faith.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:09.940]   So we're assuming if his wife was martyred that probably he and his son, that's mentioned
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.980]   in the beginning of this letter, was probably martyred.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.780]   In fact, I mentioned this before, that many of the names that are mentioned in the New
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.300]   Testament, we have records that they all got martyred.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.380]   These weren't just words.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:28.000]   When he encouraged them to persevere in 1 Peter through trials, I mean, it was serious.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   It was life-threatening.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.500]   Onesimus becomes the pastor of Ephesus.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.420]   Now, for some of you guys who don't know the church of Ephesus, the church of Ephesus is
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.860]   where Paul spent most of his time when he was on his missionary journeys.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:46.060]   In fact, when he was about to go to Rome and to be captured and imprisoned, he spends all
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.700]   night with the elders of Ephesus.
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.540]   And there are several letters that are written because he's concerned about the church of
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.980]   Ephesus.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.820]   So this was a very prominent church in the early church that was very dear to Paul's
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.640]   heart and it says Onesimus eventually became the pastor of Ephesus and we have records
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.300]   that he was martyred.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.300]   We don't know.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.480]   Again, the scripture itself doesn't tell us.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.100]   But sometimes we can be so removed in the way we read the scriptures, but these are
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.840]   actual events.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.300]   These are actual things that happen.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.260]   And it is because of the power of the cross.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:27.420]   How did the gospel, who, you know, thousands of people throughout 2,000 years of corruption,
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.740]   how did it still get here today?
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:35.900]   You would think with all the chaos and all the false doctrines and even within the church
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.800]   that we know in the last 2,000 years, how did the church get here?
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.060]   That's how powerful the cross is.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.060]   That's how powerful.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:51.580]   How deeply people were affected and even now being affected today.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:56.940]   Our greatest response, our greatest worship to him is always in response to what we already
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.620]   have in Christ.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   What we already have in Christ.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.440]   You and I do not naturally act in grace.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.740]   If somebody slaps you on the left cheek, you don't naturally say yes.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:10.740]   This side.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.740]   Right?
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:17.180]   If somebody cups you up on the freeway, you don't wave at them, say, you know, "I'm glad
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.300]   I was able to save you some time."
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.940]   You don't cut somebody off and then they wave it to you and say, "Hey, hey, hey."
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:23.940]   You know?
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.940]   Anytime.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:25.940]   Anytime.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:26.940]   Right?
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.480]   Our natural response is, "Why you?
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.020]   How dare you?"
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.020]   Right?
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:37.700]   What we see in Philemon, what Paul is asking Philemon to do is unnatural.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.700]   Is unnatural.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.740]   Christianity, by our own effort, is unnatural.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.780]   Being gracious is unnatural.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.780]   Forgiving?
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.540]   Are you kidding me?
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.940]   In our flesh, it is absolutely unnatural.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:44:02.260]   Only people who have been affected by Christ and his sacrifice can demonstrate this grace.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:08.560]   I pray that again, as we have examined Philemon in his life, that one that we would recognize,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.620]   it is in our weakness that he is strong.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.580]   That the church is my family.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:20.020]   These are my brothers, these are my sisters, that I am my brother's keeper.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:26.780]   And thirdly, that we would not be under compulsion, but by the grace of God, that we would respond
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.740]   in a reasonable manner.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.500]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.540]   As we ask the praise team to come up, I'm going to ask all of us to take some time to
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:41.020]   pray and come before the Lord, that the grace of God would affect us deeply.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:46.660]   If there's people in our lives that God convicts us to be reconciled with, to bring that to
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.660]   God.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.940]   Lord, give me strength.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.140]   If I've been drifting away from God, to take some time to remember what it is that you
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.140]   have in Christ.
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:58.180]   Maybe some of you are sitting here so frustrated because you have some things that you want
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.160]   and you're not able to get it.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.000]   But you forgot, you've taken your eyes off of Christ and forgotten what it is that you
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.180]   already have in Christ.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:10.060]   So let's take some time, come before the Lord to reflect.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:14.860]   Lord, I pray that my heart may be affected by what Christ has done.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.740]   So let's take some time to pray.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:24.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
