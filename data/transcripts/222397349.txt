[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   All right, other than that, why don't we turn our Bibles to Romans chapter 10?
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.520]   And again, I'd like to read from verse 5 all the way down to verse 13.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.480]   But our focus today is going to be on verse 9 through 13.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.560]   Romans chapter 10, verses 5 through 13.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.480]   For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based in the law, that the person who does
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.140]   the commandments shall live by them.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.080]   But the righteousness based on faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080]   into heaven?'
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.320]   That is to bring Christ down.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.080]   Or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?'
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.480]   That is to bring Christ up from the dead.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.480]   But what does it say?
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.200]   The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.880]   That is the word of faith that we proclaim.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.080]   Because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.600]   God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.240]   For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.640]   For the scripture says, 'Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.'
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.440]   For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord over
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.060]   all, bestowing his riches on all who call upon him.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.560]   For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.720]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.360]   I want to especially thank you, Lord, for our collegiates who have labored in the last
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.040]   four years, Lord God, to finish up their college life.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.920]   And I pray that you would continue to bless them in their transition, whether they will
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.160]   go on to study more or to work or just headed back home.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.000]   I pray, Lord God, that this transitional period, Lord, that you would especially watch over
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.200]   them.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.360]   Their hearts would not stray with the challenges that come with transition.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680]   And help them, Lord God, to find brothers and sisters that they will continue to run
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.880]   this race with.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.960]   We pray for the families that are here, that you would watch over them, that as they celebrate,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.680]   their hearts may be full, and that you continue to remind them, Lord God, that it is your
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.320]   grace and your sovereign hands, Lord, that's watching over their home.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.520]   We also want to pray for the fathers of our church.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.240]   As we celebrate Father's Day, I pray, Father, that you would bless the fathers of our church,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.760]   that with all the challenges of living in this fallen world and trying to provide and
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.480]   protect and lead our homes, I pray that you would continue to give them strength, that
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.840]   their labor is not in vain.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.400]   And I pray, Father God, that today will be a source of much encouragement, Lord, to give
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.760]   strength to persevere in their good work.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.360]   So we ask, Lord, that you would make your scripture alive this morning and speak to
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360]   us.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.880]   Just to kind of give you a heads up, I know we've been talking about what's happening
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.040]   in India, and as you guys know, we've started a ministry out in India, or not started, but
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.560]   is doing some support work out in India.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.640]   And so we've announced to you when we came back from India in February that we're going
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.200]   to get behind them, we're going to help them build a training center for the pastors, because
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.760]   where they are, they don't have any place to meet.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.600]   They have about 30 or 40 pastors that gather together in a tiny room and probably could
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.560]   fit no more than six or seven people, but they have 30 people crammed in there, and
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.080]   that's the only place that they can meet.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.520]   So we're actually building a training center with the two other churches, with BMC and
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.560]   Cross Life, and so they actually found the land, and then they're going to purchase the
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.400]   property, and then they're going to start building pretty soon.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.280]   And so I may have to fly over there to kind of, again, assist with the funding and all
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   of that.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.840]   But as you guys know, the work out in India is very interesting, because there's persecution
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.400]   is ramping up, and so the work that they're doing, they really require our prayers and
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.600]   that hopefully we're not just watching from a distance, especially those who went with
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.840]   us, that you remember the pastors.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.680]   And again, as you guys know, last time we went, the two of the pastors were beaten up.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.800]   And what was interesting or challenging to me was, we were all obviously very, very shocked
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.600]   because the pastors literally got beaten up right in front of us, but after it was all
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.720]   done, we were concerned for them, and the simple response that they gave us was, "We're
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   used to this.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.400]   They're used to this pressure."
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.760]   So we were the ones shaking up, and they were just kind of like, "Yeah, this, obviously
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.040]   it's not fun, but every once in a while something like this does happen."
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.600]   So the ministry that's happening there, again, even though we're just doing support work,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.360]   is extremely important.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.800]   I've been out to India probably about six times now, and especially in the beginning,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.400]   and even now, there's certain things that I need to adjust to.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.200]   And one of the things that I need to adjust to is, every time, some of you guys know or
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   been to India, when they agree or disagree, they usually just kind of shake their heads
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   sideways.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.360]   We usually do this by going, "Yes" or "No," but they shake their heads sideways.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.240]   So it's very confusing because we don't do that here.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.080]   So we're used to shaking our heads this way, and they do it exactly the opposite.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.200]   So I remember the first or second time that I was there in India, and I would do some
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.480]   training in how to study the Bible, and then I would say, "Yes, do you agree?"
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.960]   And then they would sit there and go like that.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.920]   So I don't know what that means.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.160]   So after the class, I pulled one of the pastors aside saying, "When you say this, what does
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   that mean?
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.840]   Does that mean yes or no?"
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.520]   And he said, "Okay."
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   So okay what?
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.000]   Okay yes, okay no.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.960]   It just means okay.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.400]   So that still doesn't help.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.500]   So when you go like this and you say, "Okay," is that a positive or negative?
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.800]   And he said, "It could mean both."
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.040]   It's very confusing, right?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.440]   It's just the body, they just gotten so used to it that it's kind of like, "Uh-huh, mm."
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.040]   That's kind of like the way, I guess the best way I understand why they do that.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.720]   But even after six years of going and interacting with the pastors, every time they shake their
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.480]   head, I have to take a step back and, "Okay, what did he mean by that?"
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.520]   And the Indian culture is a very Asian culture, so they're not direct.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.560]   So if they agree or disagree, they're not very expressive.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.560]   So you kind of have to know the culture and kind of figure it out.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.480]   Now the reason why I share this with you is because there are certain things that I've
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.520]   gotten so accustomed to, being raised in the United States, that certain gestures mean
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.320]   certain something different to me.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.920]   So every time I go out to India, I have to readjust.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.900]   What I see isn't necessarily what it means to me.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.640]   So I have to constantly work to turn that off in order to understand what they mean
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   by that.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.100]   Again, even after six years, even after all these interactions, it's still my immediate
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.400]   reaction is, "What does that mean?"
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.920]   It sounds like no, you know?
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.280]   Again, the reason why I share all of this is because there are certain things that we've
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   become so accustomed to, things that we have become so accustomed to, sometimes it blinds
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.600]   us to anything else.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.800]   The Jews, the passage that we're looking at, we're talking about the gospel message, and
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.720]   they were so convinced that they were God's chosen people and they were the ones closest
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.000]   to God.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.740]   And so when Christ came and preached the gospel and began to rebuke the religious leaders,
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.740]   it was strange.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.960]   It's like that didn't fit their paradigm.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.640]   The Messiah that they were waiting for didn't look anything like what Jesus was saying and
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.780]   doing.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.400]   And even with the apostles, when they began to preach the gospel, the people that were
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.160]   coming in and were taking ownership of the early church were the Gentiles.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.280]   So even the supposed converted Jews had a very difficult time understanding that the
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.260]   Jews and the Gentiles are in the same boat, that the only way of salvation is by the name
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.380]   of Jesus Christ and everything that they've done prior to meeting Christ, Paul calls it
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.220]   rubbish.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.160]   And they had a very, very difficult time.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.440]   In fact, if you read most of the New Testament, it's written to combat that prejudice, that
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.720]   the Judaizers just could not let go of their prejudice because they spent so much time
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.840]   thinking that their Messiah was going to look like this and salvation came in this workspace,
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.600]   you know, obey the law.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.840]   And then all of a sudden he says justification is by faith and by faith alone.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.640]   They received some parts of it and rejected other parts of it.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.320]   And even though they received at one point, they would forget it, you know, a couple of
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.600]   years down the line.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   Remember, even Peter and Barnabas had an issue with that.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.640]   They were followers of Christ.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:03.920]   Peter was the leader among the disciples and he had a hard time with that.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.160]   There are things that as Christians being raised in a church and in a Christian culture
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:18.560]   and maybe even say a post-Christian nation that we've become so accustomed to that this
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.000]   is what we think Christianity is.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.920]   This is normal.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.820]   And there are things that you, if you first start studying the Bible and read it carefully
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.760]   and see how it was applied in the book of Acts and how the early church behaved and
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:37.520]   what they did and then you apply that to Christianity we see today, it's nothing like it.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.680]   So I can understand why so many people come to church and say, well, you know, it's a
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   culture shock.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   How do you apply any of this?
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.640]   They have never seen anybody really apply what they see in scripture.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.400]   You know, the danger of becoming accustomed to a form of religiousness and yet having
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.520]   no power is that we become blind to the real power.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   We become so accustomed to religiosity, just coming to church and doing the work and because
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.960]   this is all we see and this is all we've experienced that we think that's normal.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:17.560]   And anything that comes from outside that challenges that, that seems abnormal.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.120]   And we end up shunning the very thing that God may be bringing into our lives to open
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.560]   our eyes to show us the truth.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.200]   That is exactly what the Jews did.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.560]   Even though they had all the benefits, all the preparation, they had the laws of God,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.660]   they had the prophets, they had God's written word.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.400]   And yet when the Messiah came, because he did not fit their culture and what they were
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.480]   waiting for, they completely rejected him.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.560]   In the previous passages we looked at in chapter 10 where Paul says that he confesses that
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.980]   they had zeal but not according to knowledge.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:05.680]   They didn't lack passion, they didn't lack application, but they just did not know God.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.000]   When we look at this passage this morning in verse 9, again in conclusion or in continuation
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.960]   from the previous week, Paul says those who live by the law, those who obey the law, they
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   have to live by the law.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.560]   In other words, they have to obey it completely.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.720]   You can't just do your part and God does his part.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.920]   If you are trying to be saved by the law, he said you have to go all the way.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.400]   And if you break even one of them, you're guilty and you're a lawbreaker.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.520]   He said the first thing about accepting justification by faith alone, he says we do not say who's
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.720]   going to go up to heaven and bring him down.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.880]   Or who's going to descend and bring him up.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:51.040]   In other words, it is absolutely impossible that you cannot earn your own salvation, you
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.040]   can't go up and then do something to bring him down to be gracious.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.920]   You have no power to bring up Christ from the dead to atone for our sins.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:07.760]   In other words, what Paul was saying in three different ways, it is impossible to add to
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.920]   what Christ has already done.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.900]   So in verse 9 he says because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.640]   in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.920]   Our primary focal point this morning is going to be on verse 9 and what that means and then
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.800]   again and how the ramification of that is in the following passage.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.900]   So this morning I want to look at three separate things that he says about justification by
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.480]   faith in this passage.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.720]   First saving faith requires genuine belief.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:46.020]   Nothing I'm going to say to you this morning is probably going to be new to you.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:52.240]   But I want you to take a closer look, not only what it says, but what does it mean in
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.420]   application.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.920]   Number one, saving faith requires genuine belief.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.560]   Number two, saving faith is confessing with your mouth that Jesus is Lord.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.920]   And third, saving faith requires genuine belief in right doctrine.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.620]   So let's look at the first one.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:14.060]   Saving faith requires genuine belief.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:19.180]   If you've been raised in the church, I mean that's probably all you've heard.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.880]   It is by faith and not by works.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.760]   We're called Protestants because we protested against salvation by works.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.080]   That there are no mediators between us and God.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.640]   There's no priest that we have to go through.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.680]   We don't have to go to confession to get to God.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.880]   So we protest it and say salvation is by faith alone.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.400]   So the backbone of Protestant faith, which you and I are part of, is justification by
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.980]   faith alone.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.000]   So if you've gone to an evangelical church, you probably heard this growing up all your
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.400]   life.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:14:00.800]   But if you've ever shared the gospel with somebody outside the church, and you kind
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.920]   of have to take yourself back.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.960]   If you weren't a Christian until later on in life and you remember what it was like
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:14.760]   to hear the gospel for the first time, some of you may remember thinking, "That's it?"
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   That's it?
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.880]   I've had people reject, in the context of sharing the gospel, reject salvation by faith
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.240]   alone simply because it was too easy.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.840]   You mean that all the sins that I've committed, you mean those guys who are doing all the
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.600]   terrorists who are killing people, that if they just believe in Jesus, that all of that
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.800]   is going to be wiped out and they're going to be in heaven too?
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.040]   And you have people like Mother Teresa and Albert Schweitzer that if they don't confess
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.160]   Christ that they're going to be in hell?
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.240]   How can that be fair?
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:57.360]   See, if you've been raised in a church, it's very strange to hear anything different.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.900]   But if you hear that as a non-Christian, you mean that's all that is required.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900]   How can that be right?
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:11.480]   No wonder you Christians are a bunch of hypocrites because you guys are just saying things because
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.420]   it's just easy.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.480]   The simple answer to that is yes.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:25.940]   The simple answer to that question is yes because that's exactly what Jesus said.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.020]   Salvation is by faith and by faith alone.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:33.500]   Mark 16.14 says, "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.400]   believe will be condemned."
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.380]   So the simple answer to salvation by faith alone, you mean that's it?
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.560]   Yes, the answer is that's it.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.860]   There is nothing you can add to that.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.460]   There's nothing you can do.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.120]   You can't earn it.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.500]   You can't pay off your sins.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.380]   That's exactly what Paul has been saying.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.580]   You can't ascend up to heaven and you can't descend and bring him up.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.300]   It is impossible for you to do that.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:03.080]   So the only way of salvation is by genuine faith.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.860]   In fact, in John chapter 6, 26 through 29, some of you guys who know that passage, that's
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.540]   the passage where Jesus feeds the 5,000.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.980]   He's at the peak of his public ministry.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:19.460]   The disciples go to the other side to rest and those people who were fed, they crossed
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:25.200]   and find out where he is and they finally meet Jesus in John chapter 6, 26.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.340]   And Jesus sees right through where they are.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.900]   He says, "You're not coming to me because you know who I am."
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.900]   And you saw the sign.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.260]   "You're coming to me because you ate and you want more."
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.700]   There's something not about Christ.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.700]   It's something that Christ can give you.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.540]   So many Christians come to Christ because they believe that if you go to church, God's
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.380]   going to bless their business or they're going to make you healthy, answer prayers, our children
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.140]   are going to be taken care of.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.460]   And it's nothing more than superstition that if I don't attend, if I don't do the right
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.020]   things, God's not going to bless my life so I need to go faithfully.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.900]   So it's nothing more than superstition, especially in a post-Christian culture.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.580]   See Jesus sees right through that and he sees a defective faith and he says, "You're coming
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:17.260]   to me not because you believe me but because you ate and you want more."
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.580]   How many people fall away from their faith because they want something and when Jesus
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:25.460]   doesn't give it to them, they're disappointed with him.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:31.220]   Whether it's church people, whether it's leadership, or whether it's just friends or maybe circumstance
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.940]   in life, like where is God in all of this?
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.300]   And as soon as he doesn't answer my prayers and doesn't give me my bread, whatever that
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.620]   may be in our life, you say, "Well, he's not doing it for me."
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:48.780]   Well Jesus sees right through that and he warns them in verse 26, John 6, 26.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.500]   Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me not because you
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.380]   saw signs but because you ate your fill of the loaves.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:02.940]   Do not labor for the food that perishes but for the food that endures to eternal life,
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.900]   which is the Son of Man will give to you.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.540]   For on him God the Father has set his seal."
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.940]   So Jesus says, "You're coming seeking temporary things.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.700]   I've come to give you eternal things, to seek labor for things that are eternal."
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:21.980]   In verse 28, "Then they said to him, 'What must we do to be doing the works of God?
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.580]   If we're coming to you for the wrong reason, what should we do?'"
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.380]   Verse 29, Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you do what?
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.660]   That you believe in him who he has sent."
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.660]   What do I do?
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.220]   If I'm coming to you for the wrong reason and he says, "Labor for things that aren't
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.940]   going to perish but are eternal," what should I do?
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.380]   And the thing that he tells them to do as a central thing for coming to Christ is to
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.220]   believe.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:59.860]   So the simple answer to that question that may be difficult to understand, that even
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:05.300]   the early church had a hard time understanding, is to believe.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:11.660]   The most important thing that a Christian needs to do every single Sunday is to believe.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:17.700]   The most powerful thing that a Christian can do in prayer is to believe that the person
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.220]   that you're praying to is able to answer your prayers.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.300]   To believe is the work that he called us to do.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.280]   Because with unbelief, no matter what you do, you will be ineffective.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.020]   If you pray in unbelief, it is ineffective prayer.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.620]   If you worship in unbelief, it is not worship.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.420]   If you gather in unbelief, it will just lead to frustration.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:47.580]   So the central work of a Christian, he says, is to believe.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:53.820]   Now having said that, especially in the church, our automatic knee-jerk response is, "Of
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.820]   course we believe.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.660]   That's why we're here.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.180]   I raised my hand years ago and came down the aisle.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.740]   Of course I believe.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.100]   I wouldn't be here if I believed."
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.140]   And so we just make a knee-jerk reaction and we just assume genuine belief.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:14.340]   Now John talks about the subject of believing probably more than any other author.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:20.980]   In fact, the word "believe" or "faith" is mentioned three times more, up to four times
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.160]   more than any other book in the Bible.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.420]   That word "believe" is concentrated in the Gospel of John.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:32.000]   So I'll encourage you, if you ever go back and study the book of John, go back and circle
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.140]   how many times he uses the word "believe."
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.280]   Over 40 times, spread out in 16 chapters.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:44.020]   He says the primary thing that Jesus calls us to do is to believe, but then he qualifies
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.060]   that belief.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:52.020]   He qualifies that belief so that we don't just assume that if you have these certain
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:57.220]   doctrinal statements or certain things that you feel, he qualifies that in John chapter
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.220]   8.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:05.320]   31 through 34, Jesus is preaching and he says, "So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.020]   in him, 'If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.020]   and truth will set you free.'"
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.100]   So let me stop right there.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.100]   Who is he talking to?
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.880]   He said people who believed.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.740]   So there's a distinction, right?
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.220]   There's a distinction between the immediate reaction of the Pharisees and some of the
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.320]   people who said, "That guy is filled with demons."
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.660]   So those people immediately, they wanted to kill him.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.260]   They wanted nothing to do with him.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.900]   And they were trying to crucify him.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.540]   So they had that people.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.380]   He's not talking to the people who are rejecting him.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.920]   In this text, he's talking to a group of people who are hearing and saw the miracles.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.360]   Maybe some of them ate the manna, ate the bread and the fish.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.180]   And they said, "He must be a prophet.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.660]   He must be the Messiah."
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:58.780]   And he says, "To those who believed in him," he emphasizes, "you have to abide in my word.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.980]   Then you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will set you
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.740]   free."
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.980]   Now when they heard this, they didn't hear it like we hear it.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.540]   It's like, "Yes, we're set free."
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.700]   They're actually offended by it.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.900]   Set free.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:20.580]   Because to be a slave at that time was the lowest person that you could be.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.420]   Basically if you were the lowest in society, it's like you have all these different groups
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.500]   and said, and basically Jesus says, "You have to be set free.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.980]   You're a slave."
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.980]   And they were offended.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.060]   "We're not slave.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.980]   We're children of Abraham.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.980]   We've never been slaves.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.860]   So how can you say that you've come to set us free?"
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:45.500]   Verse 33, "They answered him, 'We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.500]   anyone.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.540]   How is it that you say you will become free?
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.940]   Why do you say this?'"
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.940]   Because they're offended.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.180]   "And Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.380]   slave to sin.'"
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.620]   Now this encounter goes all the way down to verse 45 and 46.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:09.660]   And it concludes with Jesus saying to them, "You do not know who I am because you are
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.500]   not from God.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.620]   Your father's the devil."
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.860]   In verse 44.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.860]   Imagine that.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:23.460]   He began this conversation in verse 31 saying that these are ones who confess to believe
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:29.020]   in Jesus and yet in verse 44 he says, "You are not a believer.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.300]   You're not a child of God."
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:36.220]   So John is qualifying the definition of believing.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.740]   Some believe but we're not Christian.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.080]   They're not saved.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.780]   So they didn't have saving faith.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.660]   Now what was the distinction?
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:49.580]   They could not accept Christ as their Savior.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.360]   As our Messiah, as our King, you are welcome.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.000]   As someone who's going to provide and heal and feed us, you're welcome.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.660]   But when Jesus said, "I've come to set you free because you are bound in your sins,"
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.700]   they were offended and said, "How dare you say that to us?"
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:13.500]   See the word for abide in my word here is a very, very important word.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.420]   Because the word abide qualifies saving faith.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.100]   Let me say that one more time.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:25.820]   The word abide here qualifies genuine saving faith.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.780]   It's not just somebody who believes.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.020]   It's not somebody who says, "You know what?
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.620]   I heard the words of Jesus and it makes sense to me so I believe."
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.860]   And then he qualifies that.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:40.900]   Those who believe, "If you abide in my word, then you shall know the truth.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.340]   Then you will be my disciples and the truth shall set you free."
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:51.460]   See the word abide is mentioned again later on in John chapter 15 and he uses that word
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:57.100]   abide about 11 times in that one short section saying that you cannot bear fruit if you do
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.220]   not abide in me.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:03.100]   I am the vine and he is the vine dresser.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.460]   Or you are the vine and I am the vine.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.520]   You are the branches and if you do not abide in me, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:15.140]   So when he says you cannot bear fruit, basically it means you cannot live.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.580]   So what does the word abide in me?
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.660]   It means to continue.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.800]   It means to rest.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.580]   It means to rely.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:27.460]   So to believe isn't just how you feel.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.820]   It isn't just what you think.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.620]   It is a transformation that takes place that causes us to be connected with him.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.460]   I want to look at one more passage before we get to the second point.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:46.900]   In Hebrews chapter 11, 6, where the author of Hebrews is warning these second, third
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:56.300]   generation Christians who are reverting back to Judaism and after 10 chapters of Christology,
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.580]   of not to, warning them not to drift away from this great salvation.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:06.300]   He says in chapter 11, 6, "And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.040]   would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he is a rewarder of those
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.040]   who seek him."
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.740]   Now that's the ESV version.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.820]   Without faith it is impossible to please him.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.200]   Without genuine faith.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.880]   You cannot come to God by your work.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.700]   You cannot come to God and add to anything Christ has done.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.060]   First and foremost, it is only by faith that we are connected to him.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.940]   But I want you to continue to read with me what he says.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:39.780]   "For whoever draws near to God must first believe that he exists."
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:46.500]   Now the word "exists" here in Greek is the third person singular, where we get the
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.940]   word "I am."
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.900]   So the NASB has translated this that whoever would draw near to God must first believe
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.180]   that he is.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.820]   Remember the seven "I am" statements in the book of John?
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.740]   I am the bread of life.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.140]   I am the light.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.140]   I am the gate.
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.140]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.140]   I am the vine.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.820]   I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.180]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.420]   He has seven "I am" statements saying all that you are seeking, you are seeking through
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.420]   me.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.500]   And he says, I am.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.060]   So what the author of Hebrews is saying, without faith it is impossible to please him, but
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.500]   he who comes to God.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.700]   There's an assumption that if you believe him that you will come to God.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.180]   That you will seek God.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:35.780]   So genuine saving faith leads to a pursuit of Christ.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:42.260]   And those who pursue Christ will pursue him because they believe that he is.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.260]   That he is.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.860]   He is what?
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.980]   He is the resurrection and the life.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.660]   He is the bread.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.160]   He is the light.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.060]   He is your shepherd.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.300]   He is divine.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:28:01.460]   If you don't believe that Christ is, then you're not going to be seeking him.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:07.140]   If you feel that, if you think that rest is found in vacation, that's what you're going
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.160]   to be seeking.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:15.980]   If you believe that joy and happiness is found in having things, then that's what you're
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.380]   going to be pursuing.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:24.740]   If you believe that to feel alive you need to follow the pattern of this world, then
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.620]   that's what you're going to be pursuing.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:33.580]   Belief isn't expressed simply by coming to church.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:38.260]   Genuine belief isn't simply found by being active and serving in the church.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.380]   Genuine belief is expressed by what you are pursuing.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.540]   That's what he is saying.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.740]   It is impossible to please God.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.460]   Now could coming to church be an expression of your belief?
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.580]   Absolutely.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.700]   Could coming to church and serving, is that an expression of your belief?
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.900]   Absolutely, can be.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.740]   But not always.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:09.980]   You can come to church all your life and pursue the world in a post-Christian culture.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:16.580]   You can find rest in going to places and not in Christ.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:23.260]   So he continues and it says, "For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:29.260]   is," that he is our pursuit, he is our life, he is our goal, "and that he rewards those
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.820]   who seek him."
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.780]   In the NIV it says, "who earnestly seek him."
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.140]   In New King James it says, "who diligently seek him."
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.260]   The word seek isn't just a casual looking or casual going.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.820]   In the Greek it is an intensive word.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:48.500]   He says, "He who comes to God must believe that he is."
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.700]   And that's why you're pursuing him and because you find life in him you are diligently
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.900]   seeking him.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:03.300]   Not acceptance in the church, not an easy life, not koinonia, at least the way that's
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.360]   described in our culture, but him.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.540]   I find life in Christ and so I pursue Christ.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:18.900]   I find rest in Christ so I diligently seek Christ.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:24.820]   I find purpose in Christ so I am diligently and earnestly seeking him.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:34.340]   So he is qualifying, the saving faith isn't simply right thinking and right feeling.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.940]   All those things are true and we're going to get to that in a minute.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:44.260]   But genuine saving faith is qualified by abiding.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.700]   Now don't be confused, he's not saying that if you do these things that somehow that's
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.700]   going to save you.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.460]   No, he's saying if there's a genuine faith in you and you believe that he is, why wouldn't
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.300]   you seek him diligently?
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:06.940]   Sometimes we're confused and I may not get to the end of the sermon today but it doesn't
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.480]   matter because I think this is important.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.980]   Sometimes we're confused.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:19.020]   I think a lot of people in the church genuinely don't know if they really believe or not.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.900]   If you ask them, they'll say yes.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:29.860]   But in the quietness where there is no pressure, nobody is going to judge you and you ask yourself
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.620]   without any judgment, you sit there and you don't really know.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.020]   There's a lot of confusion because you're busy at church.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.340]   You went to missions.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.620]   You shared gospel with people.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:48.620]   You're paying tithe and you have on the outside, you're doing everything that a good Christian
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.020]   is supposed to do.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:55.360]   And because of that, there's a lot of confusion in the church.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:02.620]   If you were to be honest with yourself and you ask, we ask ourselves, do I really believe?
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.780]   Do I really believe that he is?
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.140]   Is he whom I am pursuing?
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.500]   Am I pursuing the church?
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.500]   Am I pursuing community?
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.500]   Am I pursuing purpose?
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:20.220]   Or is he whom I'm pursuing?
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.220]   Genuine saving faith.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.260]   Salvation is by faith alone but this faith has to be genuine.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.580]   It has to be biblical.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.700]   That leads to our second point and I'm not sure I'm going to get to the third point but
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:40.740]   the second point is, saving faith is confessing with our mouth that Jesus is Lord.
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.300]   In our culture, confession is simple.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.300]   It's very simple.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.300]   I confess.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.260]   Jesus is Lord.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.260]   You may say that.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:56.500]   I remember there was this guy I knew back in high school and this guy was just on fire.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.940]   He was constantly sharing the gospel and you ask him, how are you doing?
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.220]   He would say, hallelujah.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.620]   I mean this is like a high school junior and a senior and everywhere he would go, hey John,
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.620]   how are you doing?
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.620]   Hallelujah.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.420]   Jesus is Lord.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:21.700]   We say Jesus is Lord in our songs, in the passes that we memorize.
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:26.940]   So to confess, if he says all it requires is to believe and confess, I mean anybody.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:33.380]   So we made this sinner's prayer that anybody can just repeat and say.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.620]   And if you say these things, because he says, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.660]   is Lord and believe in your heart that he was raised from the dead, then you're saved.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.700]   So that's it?
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.180]   That's all I have to do?
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.660]   Why not?
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.580]   Maybe I kind of believe but if that's all I have to do, why not?
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:55.180]   I buy a ticket just in case if I die and this thing is real, at least I have a ticket.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.180]   Insurance.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.180]   Right?
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:02.340]   And it says we're not saved by works or whatever, whatever I'm doing, you know, maybe I feel
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.260]   guilty but it has nothing to do with my salvation.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.700]   Maybe I'll be a church but if I'm not a good Christian, I'm not really pursuing Christ,
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:14.940]   it doesn't matter because I confessed Jesus is Lord and I kind of believe that he was
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.940]   raised from the dead.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:20.780]   I had some doubts but we never dig beyond that.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.540]   Because that's what it says.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.200]   I did what the Bible required me to do to be saved.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.580]   And then there's so many people in the church who've hung their hats, their salvation on
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.580]   that.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:38.260]   I did what they told me to do so everything else is extra and if you make me feel guilty,
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.960]   you're the problem.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:45.540]   Is that what he really says when he says confession?
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.580]   It's important for us, one, we understand that this scripture is being written during
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:57.020]   an oral culture, meaning more people weren't able to read and write during this period
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:01.020]   of human history than there were people who were able to read and write.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.580]   So everything was passed down in oral tradition, they had to memorize it.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:12.180]   So today, if we want to feel safe that somebody makes a promise, our words don't weigh a lot,
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.940]   especially in our culture.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.560]   So if we want to feel secure, what do we need?
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.980]   We need some collateral.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.220]   We need some kind of contract.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.300]   Write a contract and you write these things and then if you break this contract, here's
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.520]   the consequences.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.720]   We get it notarized and we file it and so now we feel safe because it's written.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.100]   But you making a promise is like, what does that mean?
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.260]   I can't win a lawsuit with a promise.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:45.420]   But remember, in an oral tradition where you couldn't enter into a contract with people
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.460]   who don't have words to be able to do that.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.140]   Your confession was a contract.
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:36:00.920]   So the word confess here has much more weight than simply saying these words.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.580]   Because in that culture, saying it and being it was the same thing.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.340]   That's one thing that we need to understand.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:14.740]   Secondly, the word for confession, at least in the way that it's used in the biblical
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.820]   writers, was more than just something private that you say, you go in a closet and say,
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.860]   "Jesus is Lord."
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.820]   The word is translated in other places as proclamation.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.300]   That's how Paul uses it in 1 Timothy 6.12.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.700]   Fight the good fight of the truth.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.780]   Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made a good
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.380]   confession in the presence of many witnesses.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:43.260]   And again in Acts 24.14, Paul standing on trial because of preaching the gospel, he
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:49.460]   says, "But this I confess to you that according to the way which they call sect, I worship
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.460]   the God of our Father.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.180]   And this I confess, proclaim to you."
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:37:00.460]   So many theologians think that this confession is directly linked to public baptism.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.820]   Now we don't know that for sure, but just by understanding how that word confess is
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:09.220]   being used, it wasn't something private, it wasn't something that you just thought, your
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.620]   inner thoughts and say, "Oh yeah, he's Lord."
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.460]   He's to make a public profession, declaration.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.660]   In our understanding, in our context, it was kind of coming into a covenant relationship
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:28.620]   with God and making a public declaration and saying that He is my Lord.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.420]   That I no longer have loyalty to this world.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.100]   I am no longer a citizen of this world, but He is my Lord.
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:41.820]   So this idea of confessing is much more powerful than the way we would hear it today in English.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:49.540]   You know, years ago when we went to Romania, the Romanian church has a clear distinction
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.620]   between somebody who was baptized and was not baptized.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.740]   You will see a church filled with maybe 50, 60 people and then we would ask them, "Hey,
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.900]   how long have you been coming to church?"
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.820]   And the first thing that they would say to you is, "Oh, I've been coming here three
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.060]   years, but I'm not baptized."
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.340]   So today we would think, "Oh, how come you're not baptized?"
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:13.020]   And that's the first thing that we need to obey.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.380]   And then they would distinguish between other people in the church and they'd say, "Oh,
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.660]   that sister is baptized."
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:25.460]   Now we didn't dig into how they understood that, but the distinction that they made was
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:31.060]   if you were baptized, meaning you made a public profession, that there was no turning back.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.580]   That they were sold out Christians.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.020]   That these people have no earthly possessions, that they're willing to pack up and leave.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.540]   It's like, "Jesus Christ is Lord."
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.240]   That's a baptized Christian.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.820]   That's how they used it.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.460]   And I thought that was interesting because I think that's closer to the biblical scene
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.740]   that I see in the Bible than maybe the way it's being practiced today.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:58.900]   And so when Paul says, "To have faith and to confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord,"
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:06.740]   it means to enter into this covenant relationship, publicly professing and denouncing the world
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:11.340]   and making Christ as Lord over their life.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:17.540]   In Philippians 2.11, the scripture says that because Christ humbled himself, every tongue
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:22.780]   will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.660]   Every tongue will declare that he is Lord.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:32.560]   Now why is this Lordship, establishing Lordship, so important to Christian faith?
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.340]   Because the essence of salvation is to reestablish his Lordship.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.340]   Let me say that again.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.740]   Sometimes we think of Lordship salvation versus non-Lordship salvation.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.520]   If Christ is not Lord, he's not your Savior because the whole point of salvation is to
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.820]   reestablish him as our Lord.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.960]   Because look at Genesis.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.080]   What was the rebellion?
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.640]   What was the core sin?
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.840]   They refused to obey God.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.800]   And they decided that they're going to make independence and find life away from God.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.400]   It wasn't like, "Oh, I'm going to look for wickedness."
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.980]   What did they do?
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.680]   They ate of the tree that they weren't supposed to eat.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.820]   Think about that in today's terms.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:18.660]   Why would that cause eternal damnation?
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.660]   They ate.
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:24.720]   When was the last time you ate something and said, "Oh man, you know, this is so sinful."
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.280]   You know, maybe in and out, too many in and out burgers.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.320]   I don't know, you know, chili cheese fries, maybe too many.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.440]   Buffets three days in a row.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.360]   When was the last time you ate something and you thought, "Oh, this is going to disconnect
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.140]   me from God."
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:48.800]   Why would that simple sin cause eternal damnation for mankind?
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.760]   It wasn't the eating of the apple in and of itself.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:59.640]   It was Adam and Eve saying in their own hearts that, "I'm not going to believe in God.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.640]   I'm going to trust myself.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.120]   I'm going to trust what Satan says."
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.100]   And what happened was they rebelled against God and His lordship over their life.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:17.440]   So when salvation comes, the whole point of restoration is to reestablish His lordship,
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.360]   His kingship over our life.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.320]   So you can't be a Christian if He is not your Lord.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.240]   Because the whole point of salvation is to restore this relationship between creator
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.440]   and creation.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.960]   In fact, that's exactly how salvation is described in Colossians chapter 113.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.320]   He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His Son
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.480]   in whom we have redemption for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.560]   He didn't just deliver us.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:52.880]   He transferred us from one kingdom to another kingdom where you had Satan as the king over
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.520]   this world, fallen world, and now we have who?
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.400]   Jesus as our king.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.000]   King.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.960]   See, when we talk about the word saved, we have two different meanings, even in English.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.240]   We are saved from something, right?
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.960]   Oh, you know, saved you from danger.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.040]   You're swimming out in the ocean.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.760]   We saw a shark and then, you know, you're in danger so we saved you.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.760]   Saved you from something.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:25.720]   And a lot of people see our salvation simply as the first.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.040]   We were saved from sin.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.640]   We were saved from hell and condemnation.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.840]   But the word saved also, even in English, has the other term.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.840]   Saved for.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.960]   Like I save money, right?
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.920]   If you're eating something and you have dessert and you really enjoy it and say, "How come
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   you're not eating that?"
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   I'm saving it, right?
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.720]   You're not saving it from harm.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:51.320]   Maybe from you, you know, but you're saving it because you're cherishing it.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.640]   So the idea of salvation has two meanings.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:59.520]   One is to save us from something and then saving for something.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.280]   See what are we being saved from?
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.680]   From the domain of darkness.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.000]   From sin and its consequences and its judgment.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.440]   What are we being saved for?
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.640]   To be brought into the kingdom.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.760]   To reestablish his lordship over our lives.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.200]   And that's why 1 Peter 2, 9 says, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.520]   nation, people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.920]   called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:36.520]   There are a lot of people in churches, in our generation, who is absolutely convinced
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:47.320]   that they are saved from their sins, but have no trace of any fruit for what they are saved
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.800]   for.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.880]   Lordship in their life is just empty confession of mouth.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.040]   Means nothing.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.440]   I can say, walk around and say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.720]   Nobody's going to stop.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.080]   I can just go on campus and say, "I love you, love everybody."
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   No one's going to stop.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.680]   You say, "Oh, that crazy Asian guy."
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:18.120]   No one's going to stop because they don't believe me.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.160]   Because it's empty words, it means nothing.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:29.720]   Saying I love you with nothing to show for it has no power whatsoever.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.560]   He's not talking about empty confession.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:37.400]   He's talking about covenant relationship with Christ has been established as Lord over our
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.320]   lives.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:46.400]   Now let me touch down where the rubber meets the road.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.840]   Where is he Lord?
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.760]   What is the most tangible evidence of his Lordship over our lives?
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:45:03.160]   The two things that every single person cherishes and protects, your money and your time.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.000]   Your money and your time.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.640]   You can see if Christ is Lord over your life by the way you spend your money and by the
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.180]   way you spend your time.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:20.640]   You can say he's Lord, but if your money spending is independent of his Lordship, it's empty
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   confession.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.440]   You can call him Lord, but if the way that you spend your time has nothing to do with
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:31.740]   his Lordship, then it's empty confession.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:38.800]   The Jews in the Old Testament refused to say the word Yahweh because in the Ten Commandments
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.640]   it says you should not use the Lord's name in vain.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:47.940]   So they were so afraid of using the Lord's name in vain, so they replaced all the places
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.720]   where Yahweh is mentioned and what did they change it with?
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.720]   Adonai.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   Adonai.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:01.120]   So if you look at your Hebrew translation in the Old Testament where the word Yahweh
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:08.320]   is mentioned, it is translated with capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D. Lord.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:14.380]   And when it is all in capital, it means that in Hebrew the word actually is Yahweh.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:19.280]   So what they did was because they wanted to show reverence toward the name of God, they
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:26.840]   chose a name or a word that best would describe their relationship with God.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.760]   And the word that they chose was Adonai.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.840]   And the word Adonai means Lord.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:41.120]   That they understood that their relationship with God was the creator and creation.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:47.880]   Even though this creator calls us his son, even though he cherishes us, fundamentally
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.560]   they understood that he is Lord.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.360]   He doesn't serve me, I serve him.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.760]   I didn't come, he didn't save me so that he can live the rest, I can live the rest of
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.280]   my life with God saying, "Okay, now what do you want?
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.900]   I've done that for you, now what do you want?"
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.200]   We have that completely backwards.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.440]   He saved us for his glory, not ours.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:24.600]   So the essence of salvation, the very essence of salvation is to have genuine faith that
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:30.660]   causes us to pursue him diligently for what purpose?
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.640]   To confess him as Lord.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.320]   I'm not going to get to the third part today.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.620]   I think that's enough for us to digest.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:44.040]   And I want you to take some time to really wrestle and think about this because like
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.040]   I said, there are certain things that you've gotten so accustomed to, you and I, and I'm
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.020]   included in this, that you and I have become so accustomed to, we just have a knee-jerk
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:57.540]   reaction saying, "Oh, that's okay."
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:04.400]   And as difficult as this may be to swallow, especially in a Bible teaching church where
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:10.200]   you feel like you have all the right doctrines, when the scripture says, "The end time's
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:16.880]   going to come, you call me Lord, Lord, but I had nothing to do with you," could we be
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:21.400]   in danger of doing the same?
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:33.000]   Could people in our church be in danger, have form of godliness, yet not know Christ?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.640]   That you have zeal, but not according to knowledge.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:44.600]   That you're checking off all the right boxes, but if you were to honestly confess, do you
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.840]   believe that he is?
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   Is he whom you're pursuing?
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   Is it he that you believe is where you're going to find life and Sabbath?
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:04.760]   It is by faith, and by faith alone, but because it is by faith, and by faith alone, it is
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:13.640]   absolutely imperative that we have absolute assurance that this faith is saving faith,
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.120]   not empty confession.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:25.840]   Would you take a minute to pray with me as we invite our worship team to come up?
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:33.640]   I don't think you need me to explain again why this is so important, and why this keeps
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:38.220]   getting pounded from this pulpit.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:43.040]   The reason why I keep pounding this up on the pulpit is because the pull to nominal
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:48.140]   Christianity is so strong.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:54.800]   The pull to just conform to Orange County Christianity is so strong, because I feel
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.560]   the pull.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:05.480]   I have to fight every day to watch my heart, that I don't just assume anything.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:12.800]   That even in preaching, even in leading Bible study, even as I'm going to India to help
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:20.140]   these pastors, even in the context of doing all of that, I have to constantly ask myself,
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:25.260]   do you believe?
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:33.900]   It is not enough, and it is not safe where you and I live.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:40.340]   Not to question, not to assume, and to constantly ask ourselves, because what's going to lead
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.500]   you to sanctification, what's going to lead you to a passionate love for Christ is not
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:52.340]   a knee-jerk reaction, but genuine and sincere contemplation.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.260]   Do I believe?
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.300]   And if I believe, what does that mean?
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.540]   Let's take some time to pray and seek the Lord genuinely from our hearts as our worship
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.260]   team leads us.
