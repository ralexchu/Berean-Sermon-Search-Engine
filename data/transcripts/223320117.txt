[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   All right, let's pray before we get started.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.160]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for giving us this time.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.440]   We pray, Father, that your word would be what feeds us.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.040]   Help us, Lord God, that we would be people who hunger and thirst for righteousness, that
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.120]   we would desire you and actively, Lord, pursue you.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.480]   We pray, Father God, that you would help us to be genuine in our faith, that we would
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.980]   not hide in traditions, in habits, but genuinely search our hearts, Lord God, that we may worship
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.240]   you genuinely.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.200]   Help us, Lord God, to examine our faith, that we may grow and mature, that we would, whatever
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.480]   we do, that we would do in spirit and in truth.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.480]   We pray, Father God, that the focus would be upon your word, that things that we do
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.040]   understand and things that it may be harder for us to understand.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.400]   Help us, Lord God, to glean from all of these things and to really have an impression in
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.040]   our heart, Lord, that the Holy Spirit desires.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.120]   So we entrust this time to you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.360]   Okay, so as a quick overview, if you remember, if we look at chapter six, the seal judgments
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.480]   were opened up and it went up to the sixth seal.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.680]   And remember, like part of the thing that I asked you to observe is when these seals
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.360]   were being opened, what was the progression of these judgments?
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.160]   Were they getting lighter or harsher?
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.120]   Harsher, right?
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.640]   So in each one of these, with the exception of the fifth one, the fifth one explains about
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   the martyrs who are under the altar basically as an act of sacrifice.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.280]   But if you look at the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seal, each one of
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.720]   these seals elevates this judgment.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.000]   And then there's chapter seven is kind of like a parenthetical statement where it's
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.320]   not necessarily taking a break, but it opens up the sixth seal.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.600]   But before it gets to the seventh seal, and with seventh seal, I asked you to kind of
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.000]   look at to see if that's opening up and within the seventh seal, the other judgment,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.360]   the trumpet judgments, and then within the seventh trumpet, the bowl judgment is coming
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.560]   or whether that's consecutive.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.540]   Whatever the case is, again, we're going to be looking at that in the coming weeks,
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.640]   but before the seventh seal gets opened up in chapter eight, the sixth seal opens up
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.760]   and then what we are seeing in chapter seven is happening within the sixth seal.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.040]   So there's an escalation of what's happening in these judgments.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   And remember we talked about that last week, like we study these things kind of to observe
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.800]   like what does that mean?
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.640]   Like what are the creatures?
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.640]   Why is this happening?
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   And remember we talked about last week, like if you were the first recipients of this letter,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.360]   what would have been your response?
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.880]   You still might have been confused.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.120]   You might have read this things like, who are these eagles?
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.800]   Who are these oxes?
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.280]   You might have asked that question, but what would have been a universal response from
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.920]   everybody who received this letter?
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.360]   Don't think theologically.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.040]   Think how you would response if you read this letter for the first time as a first recipient.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   Huh?
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   Fear.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.440]   Remember we talked about that last week?
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.920]   Even if we don't understand the details of what's going on, the immediate response of
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.320]   everybody would be there's an imminent danger that's coming upon the world.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.280]   So yes, the end conclusion is Christ is going to come and he's going to redeem us.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.320]   We're all going to be in heaven, right?
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.480]   In chapter 21, chapter 22.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.960]   But prior to us getting to that point, he says, here's these things coming and these
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.480]   aren't just slapping the wrist.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.400]   These aren't just a few people.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:10.040]   Remember we talked about that in one of the seals, one of the judgments, they have a fourth,
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.240]   they have the authority to wipe out a fourth of the world, right?
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.760]   There's going to be famine.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.520]   There's going to be natural disasters.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.080]   There's going to be wars, persecutions.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.080]   So all these things that we can think about, it's intensified and it's increasing, right?
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.920]   And remember I talked to you about if you read ahead, if you look at the trumpet judgments
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.840]   and then by the time we get to the bowl judgments, it's going to make the seal judgments seem
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.360]   pretty tame.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.120]   And this escalation is not going to end until we get to the very end.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.440]   It continues to escalate.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.480]   So imagine what's been said already.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.280]   And we're only in the beginning part of this.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.040]   That the real intense judgment is going to be seen in the latter part of the trumpets
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.120]   and when we get into the bowl judgments.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.160]   So the immediate response of everybody who reads this is there is a sense of urgency,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160]   right?
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.120]   There might be relief for somebody like Apostle John who's being persecuted and under hardship
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.000]   that is promised that the Messiah is going to come and deliver them.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.760]   But at the same time, if you knew that this judgment was coming upon the world, remember
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.000]   last week we looked at chapter six.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   When Christ comes in his full wrath, what is the response of the world?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.520]   Do they bow down and worship him?
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.280]   Remember chapter six.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.920]   How does it describe the response of the people when Christ comes?
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.120]   Not Christians, but the world.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.560]   Don't look at me, look at your Bible.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.560]   What happens?
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.320]   You're still looking at me.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.720]   If you don't know the answer, look at your Bible.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   What happens?
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   What is their response?
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   Right.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.740]   Fear and terror falls upon them, right?
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.420]   And they cry out to the mountains to cover them.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.300]   So tremendous fear comes upon them because Christ is not coming as a humble servant to
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.180]   wash people's feet.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.300]   He's already done the work.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.620]   It is finished.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.400]   So the second time he comes, he's going to come to consummate everything that he started
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.320]   with his death and resurrection, which is to bring the judgment.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.140]   And at the end of this judgment, he's going to deliver his church and we'll be in a new
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.800]   heaven and new earth, right?
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.480]   So if you heard this for the first time, the natural reaction obviously would be fear.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.700]   What is another thing that you would think of if you knew that Christ was going to come
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:38.800]   and he's going to come in his full fury and you knew that a fourth of everybody you know
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:46.200]   can die of famine or disease as an act of God's divine judgment, what would your response
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   be outside of fear?
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:07:00.000]   Don't think theologically, just think what would your, huh?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.480]   Evangelize.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.520]   I would think, I mean, I don't know if all of you would think that way.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.040]   I would think the first thing you think about like all the people that you know who are
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.320]   under this judgment that they need to know, right?
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   But do you think that the Holy Spirit had intentions to sober the church with this letter?
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.640]   I think absolutely.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.320]   You think there's a reason why God left it semi-ambiguous?
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.920]   There are certain things that seem clear and certain things that are ambiguous on purpose.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.880]   When he says to watch carefully so that it does not overtake us like a thief, he wanted
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.760]   every generation, every Christian from that moment on, whether he came that year, whether
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.320]   he came 2,000 years later, that every generation is to examine this book and to have the same
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.240]   effect on us, that we ought to live soberly, not like we're going to be here forever.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.080]   You know, we typically don't think about death until death comes, right?
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.160]   But if you're studying the book of Revelation carefully, how can you not come out of this
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.700]   thinking if you really believe this, a sense of urgency, right?
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.960]   Sense of urgency for me to live soberly and sense of urgency to spread the gospel.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.780]   And I think that's exactly what was intended in the letter and the reason why he gave it
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.300]   to us in this format, right?
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.700]   So he doesn't say, "Well, he's not going to, don't worry, he's not going to come for another
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.700]   2,000 years."
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.300]   Like, oh, 2,000 years, don't have to worry about that.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:29.060]   He made it specific enough and ambiguous enough so that every generation there was a possibility
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.340]   that he could come, right?
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.380]   And there's no human being that has ever lived that had to wait more than 80, 90, 100 years,
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.380]   right?
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.380]   Because we died.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.400]   Whether he came or we died, right?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.340]   But that time that we have from the moment we meet Christ until he comes, we were to
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.820]   live with this in mind, with this vision in mind, that Christ is going to come, but when
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.420]   he comes, this is coming with him, right?
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.820]   So chapter 6, we saw the beginning of this elevation of judgment and then there is a,
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.940]   it ends with this question.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:13.180]   Actually if you look at number 1, okay, the chapter 7 is divided into two parts.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:19.140]   You'll see the first part ends in verse 8 and it's talking about the 144,000.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.260]   The angels begin and one of the angels tell them to withhold the judgment until the full
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:30.100]   number of the seals have been confirmed and 144,000 and then after that, the great multitude.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:36.540]   So there's two.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.620]   You know what?
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.980]   I did not highlight any of this.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:45.620]   I forgot, but yours is empty anyway, so you just kind of have to figure out what's missing,
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.620]   okay?
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.540]   So you're going to take a little bit longer, right?
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.540]   But here's what happens.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:59.740]   If you look at the end of chapter 6, in verse 17, it says, in verse 16, "Calling to the
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.020]   mountains and the rock," this is the response of the world.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.900]   He says, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne and
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.900]   from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of their wrath has come and who can stand?"
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.800]   So chapter 6 ends with this rhetorical question.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.900]   If this is really going to happen, who's going to be able to make it out of this?
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.860]   The whole earth is going to be wiped out.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.420]   And so chapter 7 is an answer to that question, right?
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:31.940]   That yes, if God doesn't intervene in some way, the whole earth would be wiped out.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.060]   It would be the end of human history and no one would be able to withstand this.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:41.760]   And that's the beginning of chapter 7, and he shows us, like, who's going to stand this?
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.300]   Those who are sealed, right?
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.340]   And that's basically the answer that he gives, right?
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:53.340]   So in verses 1 to 3, they describe the work of the four angels holding back the four winds,
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.340]   right?
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:00.940]   So in other words, the four winds in other parts of the Bible is described as wrath.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:07.660]   So whenever we hear this term in the Old Testament, prophetic, apocalyptic literature, it's typically
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.660]   talking about God's wrath.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.580]   In other words, it's coming from all sides.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.420]   It's like the full wrath of God, again, the imagery that these four corners represent
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.020]   to us is that his wrath is not just going to come in one direction, right?
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.300]   Remember, he's already described that there's going to be a famine, there's going to be
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.660]   war, there's going to be disasters, right?
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.260]   So when he says the judgment is coming in four corners, these angels are holding it
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.300]   back, that when it's time, he releases that.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.140]   Famine is coming not in one direction, but in every direction, right?
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.460]   Like things that you couldn't have thought of.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.080]   So when we think about today, like persecution and hardship and disaster for Christians,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.060]   it doesn't just come from terrorists.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:12:01.460]   A lot of times it could come from your neighbors, it can come from financial hardship, it can
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.020]   come from within the church, it can even come from within the home.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:13.340]   So when God's judgment is described, and he says he's withholding, in verse 7, "After
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.940]   this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:22.060]   winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against the tree."
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:29.660]   So each one of these descriptions, again, in Daniel 7, 2, it describes the four winds
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.920]   of heaven to churn up the great sea and the four great beasts to come forth on their mission
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.620]   of destruction.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.260]   Jeremiah 49, 36 and on, it says, "The four winds carry out the fierce anger of Yahweh
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.820]   upon Elam."
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:51.420]   So again, the four winds are descriptions of the completeness of his wrath.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:58.220]   So obviously it's metaphorically speaking that it's going to come in every which way.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.540]   But who's going to withstand this?
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.580]   It says in verse 2, "Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun with
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.580]   the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:13.980]   been given power to harm earth and sea, saying, 'Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.780]   until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.'
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.880]   And I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000 sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel."
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.100]   So again, the answer to the question that chapter 6 ends with is who can stand this?
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.020]   He said, "These people that they're going to be mentioning here, the 144,000 and then
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:41.420]   the great multitude, is because God is telling the angels to hold off until it's time."
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.060]   It is not yet ready.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.680]   It is not time.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.060]   At some point, it will be time.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.820]   When the full number of his elect are sealed, he said, then he's going to let the angels
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.700]   go and then the corners of the earth is going to collapse.
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.460]   And everything that he's talking about is going to unfold.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:09.060]   So right now, no matter how chaotic things may get, economically, politically, North
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.380]   Korea, it seems like the nuclear bomb is going to go off.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.460]   There's been periods in human history where I think people would have thought God must
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.860]   be unleashing his wrath.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:25.300]   You can think about all the different wars and disasters, the Holocaust, World War I,
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.820]   World War II.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:32.340]   I think if there's great fear, there's a great fear of World War III with nuclear bombs,
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.340]   what the next war is going to look like.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:40.160]   But all of these things are going to pale in comparison to when God says it's time,
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.020]   when the fullness of number comes.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:50.980]   And everything that is holding back his wrath, we're only seeing glimpses of his wrath.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:56.420]   So where you and I are right now, we've only seen glimpses of his glory.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.660]   The world has only seen glimpses of his wrath.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.520]   So when he comes, we're going to see him in his full glory.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:08.140]   But as we see him in his full glory, the world will also see the full wrath.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:14.220]   So chapter 7 is basically encouraging the church, yes, this is going to happen, but
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.660]   it won't happen until the full number has been sealed.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:23.820]   And so that's what chapter 7, the beginning is.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.340]   Verses 4 to 12, it describes the people who will be sealed.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:36.940]   And he says, "In order that they may stand in the day of judgment."
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:42.700]   What's interesting is it says the seal is going to have the name, have God's name upon
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.700]   their forehead.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.580]   And this is also described in chapter 14.1.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.540]   The mark of the seal that will be on the foreheads will be the father's name.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.940]   And again, it is repeated in chapter 22, verse 4.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.780]   But you know what's interesting about this is the mark of the beast, right, those who
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:09.180]   are not followers, they do not have the seal of Christ, it says the alternative of that
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.000]   is that they're going to have the mark of the beast.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.180]   So Christians will have the mark of the father on their forehead, but the non-Christians
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.500]   are going to have the mark of the beast.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:28.140]   Meaning, if you think about the rebellion of Satan, from the very get-go, he wanted
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.540]   to have God's glory.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:37.240]   And ever since then, the greatest thing that Satan does is to mimic what God does.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.620]   He wants the worship that people give him, the glory and honor, and that's why his attack
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.180]   to get some of his glory was to go after his children.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:54.920]   And so it says when deception comes, how is he going to come?
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.100]   As an angel of what?
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.100]   Angel of light.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.900]   He's going to come representing God.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:07.700]   And that's why if you look at the Ten Commandments, one is, "Thou shalt have no other gods before
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.260]   me," because Satanic attack is constantly tempting us to worship other gods.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:19.500]   But the second temptation is not to make any graven images.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:25.540]   To say, kind of like, remember when they made the golden calf and said, "This is Yahweh,
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.980]   this is what delivered you?"
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.140]   So there was an imitation of God.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.500]   One is to introduce a completely different idolatry, and the second temptation is to
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.780]   introduce God and worship a god in your own image.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.300]   And that's the second.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.860]   And the third is not to use the Lord's name in vain, that we would basically project what
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.660]   we think of God and use his name.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.300]   "Oh, we're doing it for God, but it has nothing to do with him," which is what the Pharisees
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.660]   were guilty of.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.080]   They had the right theology, they had the Torah, and they wouldn't even say his name,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.020]   but he said, "You call me Lord, Lord, but I have nothing to do with you."
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.940]   They were using his name in vain.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:12.820]   So the satanic activity within human history is to always mimic what Yahweh does, because
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.820]   that's what he wants.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.500]   He wants what Yahweh has.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.220]   So at the end times, it says that the children of God are going to be sealed with the name
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:27.020]   of the Father, and the Lamb, but those who do not have the seal of Christ is going to
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.620]   have the seal of the beast.
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.160]   His name and his number, 666.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.140]   So some of you may have attended seminars about this, and that we're going to get chips
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.060]   in our hands, or tattoos on our forehead.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:45.140]   What was that movie, Left Behind?
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:50.440]   They had a whole movie based upon that, and some people who've read that or heard that
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.860]   always comes and asks, "What do you think about the chips?"
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.700]   I don't think it's going to be that deceptive.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.820]   I don't think you're going to get a chip so that you can bank better, and then one day
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.100]   realize, "Oh shoot, I got the mark of the beast."
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.420]   I don't think it's going to be like...
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.700]   I think it's going to be a willful denial of Christ.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.620]   So whatever that mark may be, whether that's a physical mark or whether that's a spiritual
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.240]   mark, that it's going to be a willful rejection of God.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   You got tricked into it.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.940]   "Oh, you shouldn't have got that trip."
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:27.100]   So I remember when I was younger, the older pastors who kind of believed this would say,
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.980]   "Oh, don't ever get the chip, or don't ever get tattoos, because that might be the mark
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.980]   of the beast."
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.980]   And I remember, "Well, they know better than me.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.980]   They must know something."
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.460]   And then I started reading, and it's like, "No, that don't make any sense."
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.300]   It's definitely going to be willful.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:49.940]   The next big question in this is then, who are the 144,000?
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:57.340]   So many different groups have different interpretation of who they are, and there are some interpretations
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:03.980]   within the evangelical boundary, the Presbyterians and the Baptists and non-denominational.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.220]   We all have different views on this.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:11.940]   But then you have some groups who have claimed, like the Jehovah's Witnesses, that the 144,000
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.940]   are them.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.740]   Have you ever talked to any Jehovah's Witnesses about this?
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.100]   If you ask them, they will never tell you that that's who they are, because they can't
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.780]   have assurance of salvation.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.940]   The best that they can tell you is, if they did enough good works, they're hoping that
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.940]   they might be one of these 144,000, and they believe it's a literal 144,000.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.920]   But they're not allowed to have assurance of salvation.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.140]   So they're working hard, going door to door, being persecuted, hoping that if they do enough
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.840]   of that, they can be one of these people.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:51.660]   So I've seen variations of this in the local church, the Church of Christ.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:57.460]   Especially where there's works-based salvation, I found that this is one of the interpretations
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.460]   that they have.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.460]   You want to be one of these people.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.980]   Whether that's a literal 144,000 or figurative, you have to work to get it.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.780]   And obviously that's not orthodox.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.060]   That's not evangelical theology.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.260]   Some say, since they believe that the Church has completely replaced the need for Israel,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.460]   that this number from the tribe of Israel is also symbolic, referenced to the whole
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.740]   church.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:28.860]   And so they just look at it as all the numbers are symbolic, all the 12 tribes are symbolic,
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.980]   and so they just kind of interpret it as this is just the church.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.460]   That's one of the views.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.740]   And typically if you meet a friend from the Presbyterian church, this is typically the
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.740]   view that they will hold.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.040]   And again, I'm not going to go too deep into this, but they believe that the church has
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.980]   completely replaced Israel.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:55.840]   Israel was the church of the Old Testament, and the church is the Israel of the New Testament.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.940]   So the nation of Israel is gone, and it is complete.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.300]   And so because of that, when they talk about at the end times, it describes the Jews and
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.660]   the 12 tribes, this can't be the literal Israel.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.900]   Because in their theology, Israel is already gone.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.140]   So that's one of the views.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.660]   Another variation of that view is some believe that it is figurative number of Christians
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.580]   who have been martyred for their faith.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.260]   So instead of it being all the church, that this is a specific – and there's a reason
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.620]   why they say this, because this answers the question of the great multitude that comes
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.260]   behind them.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:39.620]   So how do you identify – if 144,000 is just the church, and then verse 9 and on is also
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.880]   the church, how do you make this distinction?
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.540]   So they came up with a variation of the second view, is that this is talking about a part
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.200]   of the church who's been martyred.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.240]   So this is some of the views.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.200]   And obviously the number one is not an orthodox view.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.400]   Second and third view, it depends on which commentary you read.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:08.600]   I think I already told you that I lean toward the fourth view, which is some believers that
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.200]   it is figurative number of converted Jews at the end times.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:19.160]   And I'm going to make a case for this, at least briefly.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:24.480]   I went to a dispensational school, a progressive dispensational school, who was very clear
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:30.320]   about he's going to come before seven years, and in the middle the persecution is going
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.800]   to start, and at the end of it, Christ is going to come, we're going to enter the millennium.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   So I learned all of that.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.700]   And there was a lot of that that was very confusing.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.680]   I saw some parts of it and some parts I didn't see.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.580]   This is one of them.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:50.120]   I didn't really learn a lot of eschatology growing up, even though I grew up in a Presbyterian
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   home.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.400]   But there's something about like, Israel is going to come back?
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:02.800]   Didn't make a lot of sense to me, especially after Israel was destroyed in AD 70.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.680]   And they don't even speak the Hebrew language, not the language that they spoke at that time.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:14.160]   And so at the end times, Israel is just going to reappear?
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.420]   So it didn't make sense to me.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.480]   But I'm going to make a case of why I lean toward that, and I can always change.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.560]   I can always repent and change.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:31.240]   But what caused me to think that this in particular is in reference to Israel, to Jews.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.000]   It doesn't mean that it's the national Jew, meaning that the whole country, but why this
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   is in reference to the Jews.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.880]   And I'm going to give you some of it.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:47.020]   In the New Testament, we are told repeatedly that salvation first comes to Jews.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:51.920]   Remember in Romans 1 16, Paul says that the gospel saves the Jew first and also to the
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.040]   Greek.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.560]   And he says to the Samaritan woman that, you know, if you're talking about truth, that
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.600]   the Jews have the truth, but God is looking for people who worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.840]   So he says that the Jews had the benefit of having the law.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.360]   Now all of that up to this point is just verses.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.400]   It can be interpreted one way or the other.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:21.240]   But the part that really caused me to think and change my mind about this was when I was
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.740]   going through the book of Romans.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.280]   And what really changed my paradigm was study through chapter 9 through 11, especially chapter
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   11.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:38.000]   So if you can turn your Bibles to Revelation, not Revelation, Romans chapter 11.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.640]   Now this argument started all the way from the beginning of chapter 1, right?
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:50.240]   We've been studying the book of Romans and he's primarily addressing Jews who had a hard
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.160]   time with the gospel, meaning that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.560]   meaning everything that I've done is useless, then what benefit is there from being a Jew?
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.800]   Like it benefited in every way.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.740]   You had the law, you had the prophets.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:08.840]   And so he's been trying to convince Israel or the Jews that you have huge benefits.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.400]   So the argument picks up in chapter 9, right?
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.600]   Then how can God be fair?
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.280]   Then all of that was for nothing if God chooses us and the Gentiles and Jews are the same?
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:25.140]   And then it culminates all the way up to chapter 11 where this is the question that the Jews
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.480]   were asking from the very beginning.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.080]   I asked then, has God rejected his people?
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.440]   And the answer he gives is by no means.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.440]   By no means.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:42.240]   And then he begins to explain all throughout chapter 11 that God is not done with Israel,
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.120]   that they've experienced a hardening of their heart and so they've been cut out because
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.320]   of unbelief.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.440]   And he says, but don't look down on these Jews because through them you came the gospel.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.840]   Right now because they're rejecting the gospel, they've been cut out and you have been grafted
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.040]   in but there's going to come a time when they will repent and they will be re-grafted in.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.000]   So in verse 11, so I asked, did they stumble in order that they might fall?
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   By no means.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.960]   Rather through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles so as to make Israel
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   jealous.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   Right?
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.640]   So the period of Gentiles has come and in order to stir them up to repentance to bring
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.740]   them back.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:26.020]   So you and I are living in a period where the Gentile church is where Christ is ruling.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.600]   And he's using the Gentiles to wake up the Jews again.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.540]   That's what he's saying in chapter 11.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:36.360]   So repeatedly over and over again he asked that question, then what about the Jews?
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   What about the Jews?
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.540]   He said, I'm a Jew.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.540]   Right?
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.540]   I don't hate the Jew.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.540]   God loves the Jews.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.540]   God is not done with the Jews.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.300]   It's just that they will also have to repent and come in.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.700]   Right?
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:54.700]   Now you could say, well, that doesn't necessarily say that Jews are going to remain separate.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:28:00.500]   If they get regrafted into the church, don't they all just become one big group?
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.500]   Right?
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.120]   Now you can make that argument, but if you read from chapter 9 through 11, Paul makes
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.580]   a very strong distinction between the two.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.140]   The other part is Acts chapter 1.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:19.380]   Turn to Acts chapter 1.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:25.700]   Remember if you read the gospel of Matthew, one of the major themes of the gospel of Matthew
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.900]   is what?
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.900]   Kingdom of God.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   Right?
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.380]   And the Jews just could not get over it.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.780]   He says the kingdom of God.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.780]   Is he coming?
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.860]   You know, when the kingdom of God comes, can we sit on the left or to the right?
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.940]   To the Jew, the kingdom of God was Israel.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:45.460]   There was a part of the understanding of the kingdom of God that they didn't fully understand
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.260]   that the Gentiles were going to come in and they're going to be grafted in.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:54.060]   But the Jews always thought that Christ is going to come and he's going to restore Israel.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.440]   Right?
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.100]   You follow me?
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:03.460]   So when the Jews are asking about the kingdom, he doesn't correct them and say, no, it is
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.460]   no longer the Jews.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.260]   It is everybody.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:13.020]   So if you look with me, before he leaves, the disciples clearly don't have a clear picture
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.500]   of the kingdom.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.940]   In their idea of the kingdom, the Gentiles don't exist or they basically have to repent
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.140]   and become a Jew to be a follower of Christ.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.180]   Right?
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.220]   Remember all that the disciples were thinking when Jesus was going to the cross, when he
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.260]   says I'm going to go to the cross and be crucified and raised.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.340]   Remember Luke and I mean, James and John, when the kingdom comes, can we sit to the
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.340]   left or to the right?
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.740]   That's all they were thinking about.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.780]   Who's going to be the greatest in God's kingdom?
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.740]   Because Jesus is going to bring the kingdom.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.820]   He's going to reestablish Israel.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.820]   Right?
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:52.660]   But when Jesus goes to the cross, they're confused because Jesus never corrects them
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.300]   about the kingdom.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.580]   He said it is coming.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.940]   You just don't understand the kingdom.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.520]   It is coming.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.880]   So he goes to the cross, he's like, wait a second, if he dies, who's going to be the
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.200]   king over this kingdom?
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.520]   And they're completely confused.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.780]   And that's why I believe that they're watching from a distance.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.940]   Maybe Jesus has some trick up his sleeve.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.260]   He's going to pretend that he's going to give in and all of a sudden he's going to show
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.940]   his glory and wipe them all out.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.620]   Well, that never happens.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.620]   Right?
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:24.200]   And that's why when Jesus is crucified, the disciples gave up.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.380]   Even though Jesus said he's going to rise in the third day, they didn't hear any of
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.260]   that because their hope of the kingdom was crushed when he died.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.260]   And even after he was resurrected, it wasn't until after he resurrected, they started remembering
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.220]   he did say he was going to come back from the dead.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.440]   Right?
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.560]   Now all of that is a set up to chapter one.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:50.220]   He said in the first book, Acts chapter one, in the first book, okay, I won't read all
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:57.220]   of that, starting from verse three, he presented himself alive to them after suffering by many
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:03.140]   proofs, appearing to them during 40 days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.400]   So what was the primary thing that he was teaching the disciples?
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.580]   About the kingdom, because this was on their mind.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.580]   Right?
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:16.220]   And while staying with them, he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:22.140]   for the promise.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:26.780]   So in verse six, so when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.940]   restore the kingdom to who?
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.940]   To Israel."
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.340]   Okay?
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:37.780]   So the whole time they were following Jesus, they're thinking about the kingdom.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:42.640]   They're confused because he dies and they said, "What's going to happen to the kingdom?"
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.860]   He resurrects and that hope is revived.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.660]   Jesus spends the time after resurrection talking about the kingdom.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.860]   So when Jesus is about to leave, he said, "Is it now?"
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.420]   We thought it was going to be before you went into Jerusalem, but now that you're going
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.420]   to ascend, is it now you're going to restore the kingdom of what?
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.420]   Of Israel.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:06.620]   If Jesus was teaching them after the resurrection that Israel and the Gentiles are going to
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.440]   become one, right?
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:17.260]   But the question that they ask is, "Are you now going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:22.140]   Jesus' response, he said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or the season that
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.380]   the father has fixed by his own authority."
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.380]   In other words, you're not going to know and I'm not going to tell you.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.260]   He doesn't correct them and say, "You still asking me that question?
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.740]   After all of that, you still haven't heard me?"
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:36.740]   No, he doesn't say that.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.620]   He says, "It is not the time."
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.620]   Right?
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.620]   Okay.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.620]   I hope you followed me up to that point.
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:49.300]   Because if you didn't, yeah, it's going to be a long Bible study.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.820]   Hopefully you followed me to that point.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.180]   Okay?
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:33:04.980]   If the kingdom that he's referring to is the establishment of the church, as some believe,
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.180]   then Jesus knows exactly when the kingdom is coming.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.500]   Right?
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:15.780]   Because he tells them the Holy Spirit's going to come and he's going to inaugurate the church
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.340]   at the Pentecost.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.740]   Yes?
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.140]   Because that's the beginning of the church.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:28.000]   When the Holy Spirit comes, makes a dwelling among them, that's the beginning of the church.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.580]   So when the disciples ask, "Are you now going to restore the kingdom of Israel?"
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.620]   He doesn't say, "No, you got it wrong."
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:40.180]   He doesn't say, you know, he says, "Wait, it is not the time."
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.180]   Right?
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:46.900]   But if he was referring to the church, he would have said, "Wait a second, it's going
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.660]   to come in a few days."
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.380]   Or he would have said, "To Israel?
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.580]   You're still stuck on Israel?"
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.100]   Right?
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.780]   Hopefully you followed me up to this point.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:58.780]   Okay?
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:03.780]   So along with that, along with the other things that I've said to you, along with that, if
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:11.460]   you come to this passage in Revelation chapter 7, it distinguishes between the Jews and all
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.460]   the nations.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.220]   So if you look at the second part, he said, "I looked a great multitude that no one could
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.780]   number from every nation, from all the tribes."
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:25.740]   So every nation, all the Gentile world is distinguished with who?
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.420]   With Israel.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.820]   Yes?
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:34.740]   So, when you put all of that together, it seems like to me that God is not done with
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.740]   Israel.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.860]   Now, is that going to be a national Israel?
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.540]   Is that going to be a spiritual Israel within the church?
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.540]   That I can't tell you exactly.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:51.980]   But he does not extinguish the hope that the disciples have of restoring Israel.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.340]   He just says, "It is not time."
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:02.860]   So though he is experiencing the kingdom on earth through the church, the full manifestation
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:08.740]   or restoration of what he had planned is going to happen in the millennium, we believe in
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:14.780]   the millennium, where Israel is going to take the front seat.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:22.380]   And everything that he promised to the nation of Israel will be fulfilled at that time.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.500]   And so that's why in the Old Testament, a lot of the prophecies that he gives to the
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:32.020]   nation of Israel, where a part of the universal church believes that it was all fulfilled
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:37.940]   in the church, where I believe, and again, the progressive dispensational or dispensational
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:44.420]   will believe that a lot of that will happen in the millennium.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.420]   Okay.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.420]   [inaudible]
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:36:14.420]   Yeah, that's how the dispensations will interpret that.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:42.420]   [inaudible]
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.420]   You didn't hear the question, right?
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.420]   Okay.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.420]   Then we'll just move on.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.420]   All right?
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.060]   Because it would take too long.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.060]   Okay.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.900]   So she's talking about the dry bones in Ezekiel 37.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:53.900]   Okay.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.100]   So some of you guys who know that argument, we can talk about it another time, but I don't
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.780]   want to spend all my time on this.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.780]   Okay.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.380]   But again, I'm just telling you this is where I lean.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.380]   Could I be corrected?
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.380]   Yes.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:09.460]   If something is shown to me that's like, "Huh, okay, I don't get that."
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.740]   But it seems like to me that God is not done with Israel.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.220]   Like, how is that going to happen?
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.460]   Is it going to be a national Israel?
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:24.600]   The number of 144,000, I think there is a, again, in my opinion, a decent explanation
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.900]   about the number.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:33.160]   The number 144,000 can be explained by how Israel was organized.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:41.120]   In Numbers 31, 4 through 6, Moses actually organizes the nation of Israel by 12 tribes
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.360]   and each tribe having a thousand soldiers, right?
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.480]   And representing 12.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.840]   So Craig S. Keener, he is the...
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.840]   Which commentary is this?
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.840]   Okay.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.880]   It slips my mind, but one of the commentaries I'm reading.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.920]   It might be the pillar commentary.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.800]   He suggests that the battalions of 1,000 were fairly standard units that Israel used and
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:17.760]   that each tribe supplies 12 battalions, which would make 12 times 12, which would make 144,000.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.640]   And in Revelations chapter 12, 7 through 9, it talks about the spiritual battle that will
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   take place.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:36.800]   So this is often described, again, in Revelation 14, 1 through 5, 144,000 comes out again,
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.920]   and these 144,000 are described as virgin men, right?
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.120]   Who serve the Lamb of God and they follow Him everywhere He goes.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:53.920]   Now, the significance of that is Numbers 1, 45 and 46.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.000]   It describes the 600,000 men.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.440]   Remember how we talk about how, you know, when Israel went into the desert, there were
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   600,000?
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:07.800]   Well, the 600,000 men described in Numbers 1, 4 to 5 are described as men under the age
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   of 20 who is able to fight.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.920]   So these were soldiers, right?
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   So this census that they took of Israel that came in were not just everybody.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.400]   It was just men under 20 who was able to fight.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.720]   So the actual number probably is way over a million people.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.840]   So these are just who were able to fight.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:37.600]   So what Craig Keener thinks is that this number is actually a description of a Jewish army.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.280]   Now is it actual 144,000?
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.280]   Who knows?
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.560]   But he's talking about an organized Jewish army who has committed themselves to the work
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:52.720]   of Christ, the Lamb, in the last days, which makes sense, okay?
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:58.240]   That this is not just a random number of people, a random group of normal citizens, but these
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.840]   are people who are serving the Lord in a very specific way.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.680]   And again, if you connect the dots in the way that they took census in the Old Testament,
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:12.000]   that this is actually talking about a Jewish army, possibly, okay?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Yes?
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Huh?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:24.960]   I put over the H?
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:35.600]   Which one are you looking at?
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.600]   Did I get that wrong?
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:41:00.760]   Oh, 20 was over, yeah, yeah, okay.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.760]   So that's wrong.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.760]   Not under, older.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   Older than 20.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.760]   Men.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:12.960]   You know what he's referring to right there?
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.520]   It shouldn't be under, it should be over.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.880]   20 and over.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:29.320]   Thank you for pointing that out.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:35.880]   So again, it begins with a description, possibly, of a Jewish army, whether that's spiritual
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:43.320]   or whether that's physical, who's going to fight alongside with Christ at the end.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:48.460]   And then the great multitude that follows, he said, these are the ones who are coming
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:53.040]   out of the great tribulation.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.560]   Now the word for tribulation typically means trials or hardship.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:03.680]   The word is used generally talking about the judgment of God or it could be famine or whatever
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   it may be.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.200]   But in this case, the word the, the article is, I don't think it's in the ESV, but in
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.600]   the Greek it has the article D in front of it.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:18.040]   So in the English, when we say the, the the is put in pretty much everywhere, but every
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:23.080]   once in a while we will say it is the, the church or the house.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.760]   It's like the, whatever.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.520]   We're singling that out for, for specific purpose.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:35.040]   So in the Greek, the word tribulation in front of it is the article the, and so what it means
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.920]   is this tribulation is not any ordinary tribulation.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.880]   This is the tribulation that's been prophesied all through the prophets, all through the
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.880]   Old Testament.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:50.400]   Jesus is Matthew chapter 24, everything that he's been saying in Thessalonians, the tribulation,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.160]   the end time tribulation.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.000]   He said, these are the people who come out of that, right?
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.960]   This is part of the reason why, oops, part of the reason why, you know, I kind of lean
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.280]   toward post-tribulation because when I look at the language here and other parts, it says
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.120]   those who, who persevere to the end will be saved.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.720]   And so even here, he doesn't say he's going to preserve them, meaning pluck them out and
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.000]   then they're not going to face the trials.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.400]   He said, these are the people who go through the tribulation without forsaking Christ.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:26.120]   So it seems like to me that the church is actually going to go through this tribulation
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.800]   and everyone's faith, genuine or disingenuine, is going to be tested and only true faith
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:40.480]   is going to remain at the end.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.080]   Before the four creatures would initiate worship, so again, if you remember in the beginning
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:51.760]   of chapter one and chapter six, that the four creatures function for what purpose?
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.280]   They're constantly surrounding the throne of God saying, holy, holy, holy, right?
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.520]   The Lord of hosts.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:02.000]   And so they are basically the worship leaders and they would initiate the worship.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.400]   The elders would initiate and then bow down and worship.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.080]   When the elders would bow down, the angels would bow down, right?
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.800]   In this heavenly scene, it's the opposite where the multitudes begin to cry out and
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.200]   they begin to worship, right?
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.920]   And then the angels respond and then the elders and then the creatures.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.160]   And so it's kind of like a back and forth, right?
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.120]   So the scene that we see in heaven is the creatures initiate and then once they initiate,
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.680]   the congregation would sing and then when they would sing, the others would sing.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.240]   It was just this scene of worship going back and forth from the congregation to the choir
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.720]   directors, to the choir directors, to the elders, to the angels, back and forth.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.180]   And he says, when is this going to happen?
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.380]   Over and over again.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.640]   So this scene that we see at the end of chapter seven, that's the picture of heaven that we
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.480]   are given.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:01.120]   When we get to Revelation chapter 21, there's going to be a more detailed description.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.360]   It's not, you know, it's going to be talking about all kinds of precious stones and the
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.520]   meanings behind that.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:11.800]   But when we think of heaven, at least something tangible that we can picture of what heaven
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:18.400]   is going to look like, this is the scene that is pictured for us by Christ, right?
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:28.240]   We typically think of green pastures, lakes, mountains, angels, I don't know, buffets,
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:33.720]   whatever it is that we're hoping, you know, whatever it is that we imagine, but we don't
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.960]   have to imagine because this is the scene that is given to us, that we're going to be
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.660]   as closer to the glory of God than we've ever been.
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.340]   And you see how nobody's like, hey, how come you're not worshiping over there?
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.480]   People fall down and worship.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.560]   They're bound down because they're in the presence of his glory, right?
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.100]   True worship.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.320]   That's what we're going to be seeing up in heaven.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.880]   So when we think of heaven, like what to look forward to, right?
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.000]   So people who hunger and thirst for righteousness, he said, what's going to happen?
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.320]   You will be satisfied.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:12.480]   So the hungering and thirsting for righteousness in the end is a hungering and thirsting for
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   God's glory, isn't it?
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   Right?
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:20.880]   So those who hunger and thirst for his glory are going to be satisfied because you're going
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:26.080]   to be in the presence of his glory like you've never been before.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:31.120]   But if the presence of his glory is not something that stirs you up, something to look forward
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:38.240]   to, if watching a basketball game is more exciting to you than worshiping God, it's
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.680]   just a matter of time that that's going to take you away.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.160]   It's just a matter of time because Satan can give that to you.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:51.060]   The only thing that Satan cannot mimic is his glory.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.380]   So he can mimic Koinonia.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.760]   He can mimic the church.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.720]   He can mimic a sense of purpose.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.800]   He can mimic friendship.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.840]   The whole world experiences this in different avenues.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:07.420]   The only thing that Satan cannot mimic is his glory because only God has that glory.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.280]   So he's trying to imitate it.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:16.320]   He's trying to get us and draw us away from him by imitating everything else, right?
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:25.760]   So if what we're looking for isn't the glory of God, satanic work will eventually mimic
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:31.400]   – it's not going to replace it, but it'll mimic it enough to bring – if that's what
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.920]   you're going to go for, right?
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:39.720]   That's why I think being lukewarm is so dangerous.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.960]   It's not like, "Well, at least I'm at church."
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.520]   It's like, "No, you could be spiritually dead at church."
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.520]   Right?
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.280]   I mean, you have – when you talk about the glory of God, there's nothing stirring in
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   you.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   There's no desire to seek after him.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.960]   There's no actual planning of going after and wanting more of.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.240]   It's just clock in, clock out of church.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.720]   But when we get to heaven, this is the scene that he gives us.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.080]   I want to spend maybe at least just a few minutes talking about the very last part where
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.760]   it – again, this is a description of what heaven is going to be like.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.320]   And I want to give you some opportunity in your small group to talk about this, but it
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.880]   says, "Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   temple."
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:24.880]   Right?
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.360]   Again, serving him is going to be our reward, right?
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.600]   It's not like, "Oh, we got to go there and serve too.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.040]   Isn't it enough we put in the work?"
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   Right?
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.560]   Because again, that's somebody who's not worshiping God, just not doing the work.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.720]   He said, "When we get to heaven, part of the reward is that we're going to be worshiping,
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.560]   serving him day and night, and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence."
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:56.040]   The literal interpretation of that is he's going to pitch a tent among us, right?
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.040]   Meaning his dwelling isn't going to be coming and going.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.840]   It's going to be a permanent presence within us.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.880]   Verse 16, "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more."
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.240]   Now, we can immediately, like if you're poor and you know what it means to be hungry and
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.880]   thirsty, like really hungry and thirsty, right?
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:17.920]   I mean, obviously, that would have immediate application, but for most of us, we probably
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.240]   don't even know what that means, other than like you skip breakfast or you fasted for
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:26.000]   a couple of days on purpose, not necessarily because we didn't have food.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.400]   But when Jesus talks about hunger and thirsting, you know he meant a lot more than physical
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.160]   hunger and physical thirsting, right?
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.760]   There's an emptiness, a longing for something more that this world can't give, that you
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.800]   can find friendship, money, and travel and do all of this stuff, and at the end of the
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.640]   day, it's just kind of like a, you know, you just kind of get a scratch in your back, but
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.720]   it's never fully satisfied, right?
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.640]   So if you go and eat of the bread of this world, you will be hungry again.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.420]   If you drink of the water of the world, you will be thirsty again.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:00.060]   So what he's talking about here is more than just physical food and thirsting.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:06.520]   He says that in heaven, our longing and our desire is going to be fully satisfied because
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.920]   he who satisfies is going to pitch a tent among us, and he's not going to come and go.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.500]   He's going to be with us.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.880]   The author of life is going to be in the midst of us permanently.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.960]   The sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:24.320]   You know, when I think about that, I immediately think of Jonah sitting out in the sun, right?
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:28.600]   He's just annoyed because this, you know, this covering just disappears.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.360]   Like, oh God, you know, I'm about to die because of this.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.080]   And he says, you know, the annoyance of that is going to be gone.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.040]   Verse 17, for the lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.920]   That's interesting, verse 17.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:49.880]   You know, usually who's the one shepherding and who's the one being shepherded?
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.000]   It's interesting the wording here where he says, it's the lamb.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.960]   Lamb is usually the one being shepherded, but he says that lamb is going to shepherd
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.400]   us, right?
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:06.640]   The lamb who made himself a lamb, the Lion of Judah who made himself a lamb, a servant,
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.040]   he will now shepherd us and he will guide them to the springs of living water and God
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.360]   will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.000]   And then fulfillment of what Jesus said, he who is least in the kingdom shall become the
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.400]   greatest and no one humble himself more than Christ.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:26.240]   And so at the end, Christ, the lamb, is going to be exalted as a shepherd and he will lead
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.440]   us to green pastures and water.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.960]   And that's the description of heaven, right?
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   So one of the things that I asked, I think in your small group, is take some time to
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:44.000]   think about what it says here and what part of that do you long for, look forward to when
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.360]   you think about heaven.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:52.300]   So the questions about persecution, you know, one and two, what's the worst thing that has
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:56.920]   ever happened to you because of your faith in Christ, right?
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.920]   That's number one.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.680]   Two, John is writing to churches that are enduring and will endure persecution and suffering.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.320]   There's, throughout Revelation, acknowledgement that the followers of Jesus will suffer and
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.560]   we all know that.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:15.340]   Why then do we so often receive suffering in our lives as an anomaly or why does suffering
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.640]   often make us question God?
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:22.280]   Theologically, we know, but it's almost like a knee-jerk reaction when something goes wrong
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.880]   why is God doing this to me, right?
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.280]   Knowing that we've been warned, encouraged, and prepped for it.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.240]   And third one is what I just put up there.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.600]   Take some time to look over the passage that we just read at the end and which part of
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.120]   the description about heavenly scenes stand out to you the most and look forward to the
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.120]   most.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.680]   So maybe in your small group, take some time to discuss that, okay?
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:53.520]   So let me pray for us and then I'll end it for this evening.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.620]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:03.200]   We know, Father, that all that we are reading and studying, that none of this, Lord, is
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:10.920]   possible without the sacrifice that you've made.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:17.880]   You for whatever the reason decided to have mercy and compassion on us and to persevere,
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:23.300]   Lord God, even at times when we are distracted and unfaithful.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.720]   I pray that your word in Revelation would have the same effect on us as it did to the
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:31.080]   first-generation Christians.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:38.760]   Help us, Lord God, to not to allow our comfort and ease to dictate our lives.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:46.760]   Help us to live with a kingdom paradigm, to know, Father, that we are not citizens of
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.600]   this world.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:54.320]   Help us to number our days, to know just how short our lives are, that we would not be
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:01.640]   satisfied with things that eventually pass.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:07.860]   I pray, Father, that each one of these visions, whether it is clear or ambiguous, would cause
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:17.560]   us to be sober, that stir in us a greater hunger, Lord God, to see you, and a real desire,
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.520]   Lord, to be with you in eternity.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:28.040]   Help us, Lord, in our discussion, in our fellowship, in our study, that we may be sharpened, that
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.680]   each one of us would actively think how to provoke one another on toward love and good
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.680]   deeds, especially as we see the day drawing near.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.180]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
