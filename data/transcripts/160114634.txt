[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.840]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.760]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.680]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   (machine whirring)
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.020]   - I don't wanna use the mic, but I will.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:28.600]   Okay, so yesterday we talked about,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.360]   and Tuesday was ultimately,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.480]   Jesus spent his time teaching in the temple courts,
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.160]   and I describe it as he's shooting arrows at the leaders,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.080]   as he's convicting them of their hypocrisy,
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.640]   their complacency, their leading Israel astray.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.800]   And subsequently, they begin ramping up this hatred
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.520]   and this plot to kill him.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.680]   So we come to today, our passages in Mark chapter 14,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.920]   if you can turn there, verses 10 through 11.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:11.020]   Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the 12,
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.320]   went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.200]   And when they heard it,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.380]   they were glad and promised to give him money.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.440]   And he sought an opportunity to betray him.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.880]   The parallel passage is in Matthew chapter 26,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.200]   I'll read that.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.240]   Then one of the 12, whose name was Judas Iscariot,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.880]   went to the chief priests and said,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.800]   "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?"
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.400]   And they paid him 30 pieces of silver.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   And from that moment,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.860]   he sought an opportunity to betray him.
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.920]   When I read Mark chapter 14 in verse 11,
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.800]   when it says, "And when they heard it, they were glad."
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.040]   I was trying to think of the mindset
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.100]   that the leaders are currently in.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.220]   They're obviously plotting to kill him.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.880]   And this kind of softball comes right in front of them,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.360]   and they are ecstatic that this disciple of Jesus
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.080]   would come to them and give them an opportunity
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.920]   to capture Jesus and to ultimately arrest him.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.640]   And we know the rest to kill him.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   And we don't get all the necessarily details
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.200]   of what that conversation was.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.920]   In Luke, you can read it later.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.220]   He does give us a little bit more details
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.220]   that they conferred together.
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.440]   But in terms of specifics of how they strategized,
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.440]   how they thought out this plan to betray Jesus,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.560]   all we get later on is that Judas gives them a sign
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.960]   that he'll go ahead and kiss the one
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.160]   who they should capture.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.480]   And like I said, there's an air of excitement
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.160]   that I can imagine that these leaders are pumped up.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.200]   Like, this is our time.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.720]   This is our time to get this guy.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.520]   And we don't often think too deeply about Judas
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.700]   and what he did.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.160]   And typically, it's in this context
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.660]   when we get to really reflect on what the betrayal meant
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.180]   and what Judas did.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.320]   I had a couple questions while reviewing this.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.780]   It's like, who was Judas?
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.720]   We know he was a disciple.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   And why would he do this to Jesus
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.880]   was kind of the things that I was thinking about.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.440]   Judas was handpicked, one of the 12.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.200]   He was with Jesus for over three and a half years,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   or three plus years.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.040]   He was involved in the thick of things in ministry.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.840]   He spent time worshiping with Jesus.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.200]   They slept together.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.760]   They ate together.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.260]   And I was thinking of that kind of relationship
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.080]   and it kind of pushed me towards,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.320]   how can I relate to that
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.520]   or kind of understand what that process was.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.560]   And I went to my experiences in missions.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.720]   And some of you have been out to China.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.700]   Some of you have been out to short-term missions.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.000]   And there's an air of excitement
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.640]   and just the bonding of people on the teams,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.880]   experiencing these kinds of things,
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.680]   living together, being focused together.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.180]   And it's a short-term picture of my experiences
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.500]   was the longest was about three weeks.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.060]   And we were intertwined with our teams.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.160]   And we ate together, we slept together,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.600]   we did ministry together.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.000]   And that's what I picture
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   as Jesus and his disciples are going through the ministry.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.580]   This is their experience.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.140]   This is, they lived, ate and breathed this stuff.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.140]   And we can assume that the life of the 12 was like that.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.980]   And again, for over three years,
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.880]   but somewhere along that line,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.660]   we can figure that Judas began to harden his heart.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.600]   We see kind of glimpses of it
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.560]   when the woman washes Jesus' feet,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.160]   pours perfume.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.680]   And he's first to say,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.120]   hey, that money could have been spent somewhere else.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.960]   I'm poor.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.460]   So we get a little taste of his selfishness, his concerns.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.060]   Obviously it's gonna boil over,
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.180]   but I was reminded in Genesis 4, 7,
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.180]   where it talks about Cain and his desires.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.180]   And it says, if you do well, will you not be accepted?
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.820]   And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door.
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.820]   Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.820]   So I wondered, how did Judas get to the point
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.300]   of this in his life,
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.380]   that he would sin in this way and be so treacherous?
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.720]   And I was thinking, what does that teach us?
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.060]   I don't think most of us kind of can necessarily relate
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.180]   to what Judas did in his betrayal.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.180]   But what I've been kind of reflecting on about this week,
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.020]   is about sin and my own sin
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.580]   and the sin of my kind, mankind.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.500]   Thinking about how bad is it?
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.260]   How bad is my sin?
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.180]   You know, Isaiah 6, we know,
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.520]   Isaiah comes across the throne room
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.420]   and sees a glimpse of God.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.380]   And his response is, woe is me.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.980]   I'm ruined.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.300]   I'm a man of unclean lips
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.820]   and I come from a people of unclean lips.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:06.420]   You know, I don't necessarily betray Jesus like Judas did.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.460]   Do I?
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.840]   It's easy to disassociate ourselves from that event,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.540]   where Judas betrays Jesus.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.180]   And why is it so detestable what he did?
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.900]   And I wanna kind of give you a comparison.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.060]   You know, if we don't understand the betrayal aspect
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.580]   of why it's so bad,
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.820]   then we lose out of the whole meaning
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.980]   of what this event kind of take place in.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.140]   So kind of what did Jesus do for Judas?
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.860]   And what did Judas do for Jesus?
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.500]   Jesus chose him to be a disciple, loved him,
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.420]   washed his feet, poured himself out to his disciples,
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.420]   which included him.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.300]   He showed him who he was.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.900]   He was by his teaching, by enacting miracles.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.420]   He was a firsthand eyewitness
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.460]   of all these things that Jesus was doing.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.500]   And we look to Judas, what did he do?
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.380]   He ultimately rejected him,
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.040]   betrayed him to the people who wanted to kill him.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.260]   He wanted the worldly riches.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.260]   And I wanna try to encourage you to reflect on this today.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.180]   How am I like Judas?
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.220]   You know, ask that question, how am I like Judas?
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.580]   And how bad is sin?
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.860]   Like I said, this is what I've been reflecting on this week.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.860]   And I've been very scatterbrained in my mind,
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.820]   just meditating on how bad is sin.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.820]   And it's really caused me to realize I'm pretty vile.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.900]   And that includes all of us.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.180]   And why do I say this?
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.180]   Let me kind of set this up.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.540]   So forgive me if this is too much later,
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.660]   but I will say it now.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.540]   So some of you know what I do for a living.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.060]   Some of you may not.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.060]   I work in computers and criminal investigations.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.180]   And what that includes is I look at people's computers.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.820]   I look at where they went on the internet,
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.340]   what they downloaded, what is stored on their computer.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.920]   So pretty much I get to do a bunch of CSI
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.840]   on people's computers.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.440]   And part of my job is to work sexual,
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.800]   child sexual exploitation cases.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.940]   So I'm gonna share a hypothetical situation with you.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.500]   So imagine, this may be something I experienced.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.580]   Imagine you come across a video on someone's computer.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:59.780]   You see a little girl, she's maybe first or second grade.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.140]   Most likely she's unclothed,
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.600]   being abused by multiple adults.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:18.100]   You focus on her face and see that
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.840]   during this abuse, she's weeping.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.520]   She's trying to cover herself.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.580]   She can't do anything to prevent it.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.960]   What is your emotional reaction to this?
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:37.020]   Obviously it's heartbrokenness.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.180]   It's pity.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.580]   It's anger, sympathy.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   It is, you know, the emotional gamut, right?
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:12:01.340]   I was pretty, well, hypothetically I was pretty angry.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.100]   And I was, to say plainly, pissed off
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.160]   at people doing this kind of thing.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.400]   But when I evaluated my emotions,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.860]   it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.660]   That's how bad sin is.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.380]   This is what kind of people I come from.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.420]   Isaiah six, when Isaiah says,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.060]   "I come from a people of unclean lips,"
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.180]   that is what we are.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.080]   And we don't experience this on a day-to-day basis
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   in terms of thinking about how bad our sin is.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.320]   It's an inner core corruption.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.760]   And whenever I hear things describing sin,
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.760]   cosmic treason, rebelliousness, betrayal,
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.020]   I don't necessarily associate myself
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.360]   with those kind of things.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.660]   But they are in the big scheme of things.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.660]   If we lack an understanding of these dark sins
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.780]   that are terrible, are an indication of our corruptness,
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.860]   we lack an understanding of where we stand before our God.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.200]   So, you know, and foolish man tries to justify everything.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.120]   And we come before a holy God,
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.820]   and if we lack an understanding of how holy God is
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.820]   and how bad we are, we ultimately cheapen what it costs.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.820]   You know, we get justifiably rightly angry
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.820]   about wretchedness and sin,
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.280]   and especially the example I gave you.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:55.020]   But God sees our sin and seethes with wrath and anger.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.260]   You know, what kind of anger and wrath
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.820]   do you think God held towards us
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.960]   for this kind of wretched sin?
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.100]   You know, oh, what magnitude of our sin
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.760]   that we justify, that we don't really ponder.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.460]   And we don't necessarily ponder how high God is.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.100]   And I was listening to a sermon this week,
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.700]   and the pastor said something that kind of stuck with me.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.260]   God would be gracious even if he sent us to hell
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.560]   for a thousand years.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.380]   And I was just thinking about that.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.180]   He would.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.660]   Hell is an eternal place of wrath,
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.920]   of torment, of punishment.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.620]   And if we just stayed there a thousand years,
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.620]   he'd still be gracious.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.420]   That's how holy our God is,
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.000]   that he would punish sin for eternity because it's so bad.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.340]   Ultimately, what does this boil down to?
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.360]   It boils down to that anger that I had,
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.500]   a minuscule aspect of anger
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.260]   that I believe is justified,
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.180]   that I believe is emotionally right.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.860]   Magnify that by exponentially what God
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.320]   and what we come before God with, our sins.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.220]   And ultimately why we are here,
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.940]   because the Father chose to send all that anger
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.860]   and wrath upon one person.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.900]   It's really, when you really start pondering the gospel,
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.460]   it's unimaginable.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.460]   I don't get it that God would be this kind.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:43.860]   He's too grand of a scale to understand,
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.200]   but how lovely is our Savior?
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:53.700]   Tomorrow we're gonna go through the garden
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.300]   and he says, "Take this cup from me."
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.340]   What is this cup?
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.220]   It's the wrath that he knows is coming.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:05.720]   God's anger meant punishment that he needs to accept.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.740]   So I just wanna encourage you to think about our sin.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.220]   I really think how bad is it?
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.220]   And get to a place where you understand how lowly and vile
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.940]   and corrupt our sin is compared to how holy God is.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.300]   And then you will begin to understand
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.740]   and we will understand just what kind of cost it was
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.860]   for Christ to take this.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.860]   And I really thought this song, just glorious days,
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.900]   the first two lines,
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.260]   "One day when sin was as black as could be,
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.800]   Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin."
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.000]   And it really reminded me like how black is sin.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.260]   Like, I just wanna encourage you,
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.800]   thinking of Judas's betrayal, yes.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.560]   He betrayed Jesus.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.640]   This was all in God's sovereign plan.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.360]   However, when we reflect on how do we take this personally,
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.080]   I wanna encourage you, just think your sinfulness
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.280]   and our sinfulness and how that will lead us to Friday
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.680]   and ultimately Sunday.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.340]   So let's pray.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:24.120]   Father, thank you for
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
