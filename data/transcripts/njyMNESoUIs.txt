[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   So please wrap it up.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.960]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:51.960]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.720]   All right, AV team, can you match the slide?
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:06.040]   All right.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.640]   Hope you guys have had some fruitful discussion.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.880]   Was this an easy passage or very difficult?
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.920]   It was dense, right?
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.760]   So if I get to this--
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.560]   I'm now at the end of chapter 2.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.520]   And there are some internal objections and questions
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.560]   that I might have.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.840]   And I put them on there for you.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.720]   It's calling us to not be argumentative, not pilfering
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.960]   if we're a bond slave.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.380]   If I'm a man, an older man, I'm supposed
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.140]   to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in love
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.240]   and faith and perseverance.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.860]   If I'm a young woman, I'm supposed to be
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.240]   subject to my own husband.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.200]   Like, there's all of these things.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.160]   So the natural question, if you didn't grow up in the church,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.880]   would be, why?
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.840]   Why should I live like this?
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.640]   I'm my own boss.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.000]   Why should I live like this?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.320]   And if I did grow up in the church,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.200]   I'm a cynic because I've tried it all.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.760]   And then I fall short, right?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.040]   Is it possible to live like this, to be sensible,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.740]   to be holy, because I have strong desires
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.620]   for different things.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.180]   Is it possible for me to live like this?
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.340]   And then there's some snarky people that might say,
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.260]   well, what happens if we don't live like this?
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.140]   How far do we--
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.060]   can I be a Christian and not be zealous for good deeds?
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.140]   Can a true Christian still be worldly?
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.980]   Those are objections that will come up.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.300]   And then some people who are really hardworking,
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.700]   overachievers, will be like, what is the reward for living
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.580]   like this?
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.140]   If a thief on the cross did nothing,
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.020]   he got the same reward as someone
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.100]   who spends 50 years serving the Lord
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.540]   and sacrificing on the mission field, the same reward.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.540]   There might as well be the thief on the cross.
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.300]   These are some human thoughts that we have.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.720]   So these are the objections that are going to be there.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.380]   And today's section is the second one
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.140]   that is full of theology.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.940]   The first one was very brief in chapter 1 in the beginning.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.700]   And then two weeks from now, we're actually
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.820]   going to look at chapter 3 that give you the motivation.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.420]   So we've gone over this slide before.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:34.340]   And I'm going to start with verse 15.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.860]   With all authority-- and you'll see, hopefully,
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.860]   why I'm doing this.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:47.220]   These things speak and exhort and reprove.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.700]   With all authority, let no one disregard you.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.100]   This almost seems very like it's a license for me
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.340]   to abuse my authority in some ways, right?
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.620]   So here are some questions.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.380]   What are these things?
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.460]   And this is very common of the Pauline epistles.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.060]   And it includes what was said and then
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.180]   what is going to be said.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.060]   And then what are the things that are to be spoken?
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.220]   What are the things that need to be exhorted and reproved?
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.300]   So what are these things?
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.340]   And what is the source of the authority
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.140]   for the servant of God?
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.640]   And these are three of the questions
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.420]   that I came up with for myself.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.820]   And it's something similar that comes up in Titus 3.8.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.180]   This is a trustworthy statement.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.640]   And concerning these things, I want
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.660]   you to speak confidently so that those who have believed God
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.340]   will be careful to engage in good deeds.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.900]   So there's a similar theme that's a common.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.500]   These things are good and profitable for men.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.940]   So what's my authority?
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.060]   Would you say for me, is it my education and my degrees
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.540]   that give me my authority?
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.540]   How about my experiences?
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.580]   Is that what gives me my authority or my age?
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.940]   Hey, I was a CEO in my former life.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.380]   Now I'm a pastor.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.700]   So I know how to manage people.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.540]   Listen to me.
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.420]   Maybe my age.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.060]   It's weird that now I'm on the older side of our church.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.180]   And I'm still young.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.140]   So is it my age?
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.140]   Because you're 20 years younger than me.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.420]   Listen to what I have to say.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.060]   You don't know what you're talking about, freshly bam.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.800]   So if I'm talking to--
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.180]   Emily's looking at me right here.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.100]   So let's say I'm talking to Emily's mom.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.900]   Do I say, I am younger than you, so I'm more hip.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.700]   Listen to me.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.660]   Is that my authority?
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.300]   So what is my authority?
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.620]   Is it my size?
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.820]   I'm fatter than most.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.500]   Listen, or I'll sit on you.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   You will die.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.460]   Is that my authority?
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.780]   So here it is.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.780]   Paul says something similar to Timothy.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.540]   And I'm going to read this for you.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.740]   "Evil men and imposters will proceed from bad to worse,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.180]   deceiving and being deceived."
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.580]   These are false prophets.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.540]   And remember, I've mentioned this in the past.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.940]   A false prophet usually doesn't even know he's a false prophet.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.420]   It's dangerous.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.420]   So deceiving and being deceived.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.540]   You, however, continue in the things you've learned
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.020]   and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.980]   Because remember, Timothy, from an early age, from a child,
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.220]   he learned the Holy Scriptures.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.500]   And that from childhood, you have
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.460]   known the sacred writings which are able to give you wisdom.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.420]   That leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.820]   All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.300]   for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness,
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.940]   so that the man of God may be adequate,
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.060]   equipped for every good work.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.180]   And here's a very strong command.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.500]   I solemnly charge you in the presence of God
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.020]   and of Christ Jesus, lest you be damned, Timothy,
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.980]   who is to judge the living and the dead,
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.100]   and by his appearing in his kingdom, preach the word.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.700]   Be ready in season and out of season.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.700]   Reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.580]   Why are we so high on Scripture?
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.820]   Because my authority does not come from my education,
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.260]   my degree, how articulate I can be.
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260]   It doesn't come from my experience.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.980]   It doesn't come from my worldview.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:40.340]   My authority comes from how in line what I say
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.780]   is with the Scriptures.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.220]   Does that make sense?
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.060]   That's why it's important for you
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.760]   to have leaders who love the Scriptures, who
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.540]   don't love a theological paradigm or a framework,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.500]   but who really love the Scriptures,
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.540]   because that's where our authority comes from.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.220]   All right?
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.020]   So why do I start with that?
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.860]   Because there are theological consequences
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.740]   to some of the verses that we looked at today.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:16.180]   You may end up an Arminian if you leap off
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.420]   a verse the wrong way.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.620]   You're a Calvinist if you leap off it a different way.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.100]   So there are different things that can happen when
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.420]   you dive deep into these verses.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:33.060]   So I'm going to try to do things a little bit differently
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.780]   tonight, because we're doing another theological dance
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.780]   section two weeks from now.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.740]   But I'm going to look at bringing salvation
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.860]   to all men first.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:48.100]   "For the grace of God has appeared,
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.300]   bringing salvation to all men."
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.700]   So what is the grace of God?
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.120]   If you've grown up in the church,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.660]   you've heard this a lot, so it might have lost its meaning.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.940]   The grace of God--
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.020]   in other words, the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.500]   it's appeared.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   OK?
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.260]   Now, if you guys have heard the words justice, mercy,
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.460]   and grace, you kind of know what they mean.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.660]   But you don't always feel what they mean, right?
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.940]   So here's what justice is.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:30.540]   It's a paying out a deserved retribution or reward.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.660]   A paying out deserved retribution or reward.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.780]   It's an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth--
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.460]   justice.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.780]   Mercy is a withholding of retribution.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.460]   OK?
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.300]   And grace is applying generous kindness
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.260]   in the place where retribution was deserved.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.580]   And it's unmerited favor for the wicked.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.140]   All right?
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.820]   So in order to help you emotionally feel this,
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.180]   I'm going to bring out a friend.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:09.660]   Some of you guys have already met him.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.940]   I call him Amos Quito.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.220]   His name is Amos.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.860]   All right?
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.580]   I hate Amos and his kind.
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.420]   You guys hate Amos and his kind, too?
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.420]   OK?
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.460]   If there was a mosquito this big, how many of you
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.300]   would leave it alive?
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.660]   Every single one of you would kill it,
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.900]   especially if I said, he has dengue.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.700]   He has Zika.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.700]   He has malaria.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.940]   First one to kill it gets $100.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.820]   Kill it.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:51.300]   And if we killed Amos, you would think nothing of it.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.300]   OK?
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.940]   In a sense, justice--
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.420]   let's say Amos killed someone at our church.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.580]   OK?
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.140]   He killed someone.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:15.740]   Justice is be gone, Amos, in all your kind.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.940]   OK?
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.900]   Mercy is this.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.300]   [HUMMING]
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:28.100]   I take him out, and I let him go.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.780]   You guys following me?
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.340]   Justice is splat.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.260]   Mercy is, oh, poor thing.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.220]   Let it go.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.620]   Grace is, [HUMMING]
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.260]   I know you can't help yourself, Amos.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.260]   Maybe you live such a lonely life.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.700]   Everybody hates you.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.820]   You have been one of the worst recipients of the curse of sin.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.060]   In the Garden of Eden, you probably ate no blood.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.820]   I adopt you.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.740]   I will give you a name.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.780]   You shall be called Amos.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.380]   You will be the younger brother to Matthias and Karis Chung.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.180]   They go to Orange County Classical Academy.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.940]   I will enroll you in their school.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.940]   We have 529 savings accounts for them.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.340]   I will open one up for you.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.820]   You shall sit at our table as an equal, Amos.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.860]   I love you so much, my son.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.460]   That's grace.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.380]   And we mentioned this about four weeks ago.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.140]   The distance between me and the mosquito,
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.780]   the distance between me and God, which is the greater distance.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:51.580]   It's the distance between me and God is an infinitely greater
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.180]   chasm than me and this silly mosquito.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:01.340]   When the grace of God has appeared,
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:07.420]   bringing salvation to all men, that's very, very, very, very
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:07.920]   absurd.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:18.060]   So we think that's not fair that some people, because they're
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.700]   elected of God, they go to heaven.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.700]   And some people, they get their reprobate.
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.820]   Reprobation means God willingly chooses not to save.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:36.060]   Emotionally and instinctively, we say, that sucks.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:44.500]   How could a good God, loving God, send people to hell?
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.620]   Even if we understand this theologically,
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.740]   emotionally, there's a discomfort.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.380]   Agree or disagree?
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.180]   Because we don't understand the word grace.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.220]   The distance between me and this mosquito
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.380]   is a lot smaller than God and me.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.220]   The fact that he chose to save some in and of itself
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.340]   is an absurdity.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.580]   So I wanted to hedge our theological discussion first
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.380]   with that emotion.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.660]   Because there are books upon books
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.820]   written about what's covered in each verse.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.620]   Would you guys agree with that?
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.060]   I can't explain all of that in 15 minutes.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.260]   So I'm not going to even try.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.740]   So I'm going to do tonight, just set some hedges around.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.580]   All right?
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.140]   And all men does not mean universal salvation
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.980]   for everybody.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.780]   You guys, if you've grown up in the church,
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.700]   you already know that.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.420]   But that's what it doesn't mean.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.380]   It's a universal opportunity for salvation.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.460]   But then the emotional, like--
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.380]   the little bit of attention arises when you're saying,
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.380]   if it's a universal opportunity, but you just
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.860]   said there's people who are reprobate, right?
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.100]   How do we reconcile that?
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.940]   It's difficult. So I'm not going to try tonight.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.940]   OK?
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.640]   But I want to explain to you what
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.620]   is called the ordo salutis.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.620]   In Latin, that means the order of salvation.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.140]   And this is what we would ascribe to theologically
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.940]   of what salvation is.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:37.820]   The grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all men.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.700]   Depending on who you are and what your Christian background
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.780]   was, the word salvation, the understanding of it
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.500]   might vary.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:51.100]   But this is what salvation in complete package form is.
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.220]   All right?
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:59.860]   The first one is election, call, regeneration, conversion,
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.580]   justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance,
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.740]   death, and glorification.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.620]   There's 10.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:13.380]   And they're pretty standard across the board of just
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.540]   the Protestant faith, OK?
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.760]   Or the Calvinistic faith.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.580]   So it's pretty standard.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.780]   These are the 10.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:27.060]   And I'm going to try to give you a little mental formula
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.580]   to try to remember the order.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.140]   All right?
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.660]   If you look at the bottom, every Christian
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.900]   reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.700]   Repeat.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.560]   Go.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.260]   Every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.020]   Again, every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:43.740]   One more time.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.580]   Every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.740]   The second one is similar.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.740]   OK, the second five.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.660]   All saints preach Deo gloria.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.540]   OK, you want to put the soli in there, but sorry, there's no s.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.500]   OK?
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.900]   All saints preach Deo gloria.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.900]   Go.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.380]   All saints preach Deo gloria.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.460]   OK, first one.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.380]   Every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.500]   Every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.340]   All saints preach Deo gloria.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.340]   Can you cover your eyes?
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.260]   Just try it, all right?
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.860]   Every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.220]   All saints preach Deo gloria.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.300]   You're going to have to review that at home a little bit.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.780]   OK?
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.100]   Now, election is God's choosing before the creation
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.300]   of the world to save.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:37.980]   OK?
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.660]   The second one is the gospel call that goes out.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.700]   The regeneration is when someone's heart
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.580]   is changed instantaneously because of the grace of God.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.700]   And that person then is converted.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.460]   And once that person is converted
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.740]   and there's a profession of faith in Christ,
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.660]   legally, he's justified, innocent.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.860]   And then he doesn't just leave it at innocent.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.460]   There's an adoption process.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.220]   And then after a child of God is adopted, the spirit of God
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.780]   starts doing work.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.580]   And whether he dies at 40 or 60 or 80,
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.660]   there's a sanctification process.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.780]   And then Hebrews 9 27, just as all--
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.020]   what will happen to all of us?
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.660]   We will physically die.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.300]   And then we're glorified.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.260]   That's the order salutis.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.540]   All right?
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:41.140]   Every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.020]   All saints preach Deo gloria.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.580]   So just try to remember that.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.100]   Hopefully that helps some.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:48.820]   OK?
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.500]   A little quiz.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:55.180]   Election, what's the C?
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.340]   Call, what's R?
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.140]   Regeneration, what's the other C?
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:07.740]   Conversion, J. Justification, A. Adoption, S. Sanctification,
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.180]   P. Perseverance, D. Death.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.420]   And then the G is glorification.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.180]   All right?
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.260]   Why is this all important?
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.460]   Because it's all in Titus.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.140]   You see that?
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:29.060]   Election, call, regeneration, conversion, justification,
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.100]   and adoption are all covered in each
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.780]   of those little theologically rich sections in chapter 1
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.380]   verses 2 to 4, chapter 2 verses 11 to 14, chapter 3.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.420]   In two weeks, we're going to look at verse 4 and on.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.980]   So 1 through 6, election, call, regeneration, conversion,
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.380]   justification, adoption, are all described as the reason
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.780]   why we should be holy people.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:20:00.260]   Because he didn't just show us mercy and let us go.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.660]   He said, you know what?
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.500]   Hell is a sucky place.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.820]   My wrath is there.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:10.180]   So bypass hell and just be gone.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.940]   He didn't just do that.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:18.460]   He said, I adopt you as my child raised you up as a fellow heir
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.860]   with Christ, according to Romans 8.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.820]   Sonship.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.540]   OK?
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:32.460]   So that should cause you to be sanctified, not out of duty,
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.260]   although it is a duty, but out of praise and worship
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.500]   and reverence.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:48.020]   That should be so sweet, to live sensibly, righteously,
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:53.220]   devoutly in the present age until you die.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.100]   And then the death and glorification
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.900]   are also mentioned, because in the hope of eternal life,
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.060]   which is God who cannot lie, promised long ages ago.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.780]   Coincidentally, eternal life has already
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.340]   started if you're a Christian.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.420]   John 17 3, now this is eternal life,
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.940]   that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.900]   whom you have sent.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.140]   Do you know Jesus Christ?
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.140]   Not just if you do.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.740]   Yeah, you know him in part right now.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.900]   You don't know him quite yet in full,
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.500]   but that'll happen, 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.060]   when you get to heaven.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.660]   Eternal life has already started,
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.500]   but there is a future hope.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.340]   And according to Titus 2, verse 13, we look forward to it,
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.740]   right?
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.620]   OK?
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.020]   So one more time.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:44.420]   Every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.620]   All saints preach Deo gloria.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:55.780]   Election, call, regeneration, conversion, justification,
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.340]   adoption, sanctification, perseverance, death,
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.180]   and glorification.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.600]   I'm going to provide-- these slides are going to be there
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.340]   for you, so you can practice this at home.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.020]   All right?
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.860]   Now, I'm going to look at the theological dense question,
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.980]   or this section.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.340]   And I'm just going to put it in an outline.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.620]   And as I follow the outline of this section,
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.060]   I see that there is a means.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.580]   I see that there is a result. I see
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.340]   that there is an application on our end and a motivation.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.940]   And I look at it as an engagement.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.340]   And I talked about this in a sermon about a couple months
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.620]   ago.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.380]   So I started memorizing Titus back in June,
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.500]   just meditating on it almost every day, a few times a day,
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.340]   as the verses are cycling through my head.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.060]   And I kept thinking of a wedding and an engagement.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.380]   OK?
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.780]   So there's a means.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.660]   That's a proposal.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.980]   The epiphany of God, appearing of God, has come.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:03.860]   He's said, I invite you into an eternal relationship with me.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.460]   There's a proposal.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.420]   And the result is now we're engaged.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.660]   And right now, in the engagement process,
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.380]   we're supposed to prepare, make ourselves all pretty,
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.100]   lose some weight, get the invites out.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.700]   Right?
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.860]   There's work to be done.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.660]   Engagement is not a time where you just go,
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.980]   I can't wait to be married.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.180]   I wonder when the wedding is.
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.420]   You don't do that.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.980]   Engaged people, their lives suck.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.740]   They're tired all the time.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.660]   Are you engaged?
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.740]   Nod your heads if that's the truth.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.220]   You're always tired.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.300]   OK?
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.260]   But it's a good tired.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.980]   Because the motivation is the wedding's coming.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.300]   No one wants to stay engaged forever.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.940]   If you want to stay engaged forever,
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.940]   there's something wrong with your relationship.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.420]   If someone were to tell you, I want
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.900]   to stay engaged forever, I would tell the other person, leave.
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.900]   OK?
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.980]   So a natural engaged person's affections
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:07.620]   are, I can't wait till this relationship is permanent.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:13.420]   So that's how 11 to 14 is organized.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.300]   And the engagement stuff, it's not theological.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.660]   It just helps you remember.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.660]   OK?
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.160]   So here.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.380]   What's the means?
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.740]   The grace of God has appeared.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.500]   Christ Jesus.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.900]   You guys see that?
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:36.420]   The next little column is the result. We're engaged now.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.500]   Salvation has been brung.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.860]   OK?
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.780]   Instruction is now going on.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.500]   Redeeming is a process that's going on.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.820]   Purification is a process that's going on.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.980]   And then what's the Christian application?
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.940]   Bond slave, young woman, old woman, young man, older man.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.060]   What's the application?
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.340]   Elders, all of you.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.740]   Titus.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.860]   What's the application?
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:11.300]   Now that you're engaged to be betrothed forever, deny.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   Live.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.620]   Look.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.700]   Be zealous.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.420]   And the motivation is a wedding's a coming.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:28.820]   So don't get lost in all the details of what is epiphany?
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.380]   Why is it used twice here?
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.260]   Is the first epiphany the same as a second epiphany appearance?
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:34.740]   OK?
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.340]   What exactly is all men?
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.260]   And why is it all people in this translation?
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.900]   You guys have probably thought through all of that.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.700]   But to put it simply, if you're a child of God,
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.340]   you should not be able to contain the excitement
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.020]   to be finally one.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.020]   Amen?
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.260]   But the problem is we don't look forward to heaven
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.340]   because the worldly desires are running rampant.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.220]   Ungodliness is running rampant around us.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.180]   So our minds get--
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.460]   we get sidetracked.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.300]   But if we were longing for heaven,
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.900]   chances are it's because we have gotten a distaste of this world.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.420]   If you love the world, you're not going to long for heaven.
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.180]   You're going to want Jesus to come when you're 1,000 years old.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.780]   Actually, no, sorry, 95.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.020]   When you have to wear a diaper, right?
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.020]   You want Jesus to come when you're like ready.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.820]   You've lived-- no, but if your wholehearted
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.100]   desire is to just be with God,
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.700]   you won't care if he comes tomorrow.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.780]   Okay?
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.980]   Zealous for good deeds, I just put a little quote in there.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.980]   This verse deals a death blow--
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.820]   sorry, I typed wrong, death bow--
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:55.140]   death blow to any theology that separates salvation
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.780]   from the demands of obedience to the lordship of Christ.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.780]   If I am engaged to be married,
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.420]   there are some unspoken rules.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.900]   I'm not supposed to be flirting with other ladies
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.220]   if I'm engaged to be married.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.700]   I'm supposed to be a good steward with my finances
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.580]   for our future family
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.580]   instead of being extravagant and reckless.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.300]   I'm supposed to start treating her parents
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.580]   with honor and respect that is due of my own,
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.580]   even if I'm not quite yet married.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.820]   Do you guys follow the logic?
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.380]   There are rules of engagement, okay?
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:48.580]   So it's impossible to separate holiness in our life
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.060]   from the free gift of God.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.700]   You can't.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.860]   Does this make sense?
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.580]   Even if other church people call you legalistic,
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.580]   self-righteous, Bible-thumper, prude,
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.580]   backward Christian, Pharisee,
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.580]   don't divorce these two things.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.180]   Amen?
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.660]   So illustrations I want to leave you with.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.380]   Grace of God.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.380]   I mean, you understand what I'm saying.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.780]   Grace of God.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.380]   And that zeal to be done with the engagement.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.580]   They are the two things I want to kind of emblazon
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.780]   into your heads.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.180]   So here's the application questions
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.180]   that would be good to just talk through.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.180]   How zealous are you for good deeds?
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.180]   What are the hindrances to your godly zeal?
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.780]   Second, are you looking forward to the return of Christ?
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.980]   Or have you not thought much about it?
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.180]   What are some areas of ungodliness or worldly desires
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.780]   you need to say no to?
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.580]   Because it says it's possible now, right?
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.180]   Because the grace of God has appeared,
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.180]   bringing salvation to all men,
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:04.980]   instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.780]   And to live, what?
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.580]   Sensibly, righteously, and godly.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.780]   So it's possible to say yes to godliness.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.780]   So what are the areas where you need the people around you
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.580]   to just come and aid you in your endeavor?
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.180]   So those are the things that I want to leave you with.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.580]   Next week is only three verses.
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.780]   Five is a lot, okay?
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.180]   Three verses, and it's going to be kind of meaty.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.580]   So I would encourage you to study well.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.380]   Because there are a lot of controversial applications today
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.380]   about what it means to subject ourselves
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.980]   to every rule and authority government, right?
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.380]   Can you guys see how that's going to be sensitive?
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.980]   So prepare well, and don't say, "Well, I feel..."
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.380]   No, no, your feelings don't matter.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.580]   What's the authority? It's the Word of God.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.180]   So what does a whole scripture have to say
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.980]   if you can look through it to see our relationship to the government?
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.180]   What the saints of old, how they relate to the government.
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.180]   So if you have time, look into that.
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.780]   Don't consult Facebook, that's not a good source.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.980]   Don't consult CNN, Fox News, that's not a good source.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.580]   Don't just go to the Word and see what the Word has to say.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.180]   Ask inductive questions, and then we're going to see how all of that fits.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:17.980]   All right?
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.780]   So these are the applications, and the remainder of your time,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.980]   let's just pray and discuss it together.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.980]   Let me close for us in prayer, and then we'll end our night.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:36.380]   Father, we are very short-sighted.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.980]   We are very forgetful as just fallen humanity.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.380]   And Lord, we need regular reminders of our new identity in Christ.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.380]   We need regular reminders that this earth is not our home,
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.580]   that engagement is not to be forever,
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:59.580]   but that our eternal life and our full and complete knowledge of you, sin-free,
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.780]   Lord, that's something that we should be longing for.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:07.780]   And so I pray that you would just purge our hearts of worldly desires,
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.980]   fix our eyes on Christ,
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.380]   and Lord, as much as you've called us to be holy,
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.780]   we know that it's by your grace.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:21.380]   And so we ask for more grace to sustain us, to protect us, to guard, guide, and lead us.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.380]   So we thank you for our evening together, and we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.980]   Amen.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.580]   Amen.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.180]   Amen.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.780]   Amen.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.380]   Amen.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.980]   Amen.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.580]   Amen.
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:45.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
