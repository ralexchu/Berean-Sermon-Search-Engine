[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   All right, let's start.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.320]   All right, we're looking at Revelations chapter 9.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.480]   We're looking at the two of the three woes, the fifth and sixth trumpets.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.960]   Okay, so we're going to be dealing with, again, the in between the sixth and seventh, and
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.360]   then seventh and on afterwards.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.760]   Let me pray for us before we get in.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.360]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for this evening.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.280]   We pray, Father, that you would continue to draw your people to yourself, help us to lean
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.120]   on you and not on our own efforts or our own understanding.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.560]   I pray, Father God, that your word would come alive and strengthen and empower us, Lord
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560]   God.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.760]   And this is time to you, Lord, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.840]   Can somebody do me a favor?
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.480]   You know the glass doors over there because all the AC is on?
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.880]   If we have both of them opened, all the AC cold air will go out.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   Okay.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:23.960]   All right, if we're looking at Revelation chapter 6, 1 through 21.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.240]   Okay.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.880]   So the first four, again, on the top of the page, the first four trumpet plagues only
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.200]   took six verses to cover.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.600]   If you remember, it was pretty rapid fire.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.800]   It was kind of like the first part of it was the seventh seal, and then as soon as that
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.320]   was done, we jumped into the trumpets.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.520]   And then the first four trumpets, it was pretty rapid fire.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.640]   In fact, it only covered six verses from one after another.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.920]   But we're getting into the last time chapter 8 finished was saying that there's three woes
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   coming.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.000]   And it says, "Woe, woe, woe is coming."
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.200]   And so it signified the intensity of the judgment that's coming.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.120]   And so if you've read through it and you studied it before you came, you already know that
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.400]   what we're covering today is far more intense than what happened prior.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.360]   So there's an increasing level of judgment upon each one of these trumpets.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.600]   And so we're going to be covering the two, and then the third and the significant woe
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   that's coming.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.280]   And so again, it keeps increasing, and then by the time we get to the seal judgments,
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.520]   it's even more intense than that.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   So you can imagine, if you haven't read, you can imagine just how intense it will be that
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.800]   up to this point, a third of humanity is killed and tortured, and yet the third woe hasn't
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   even come yet.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.480]   And then the real severity is actually coming in the seal judgments.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.680]   So again, the first part of it, again, just by the sheer number of verses that we're going
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:59.160]   to be covering, the first woe is a severe torment, is carried out by the demonic forces
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.640]   of the abyss.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.800]   It doesn't say abyss, but again, the judgment seems to be coming from the abyss, and most
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.760]   commentaries believe that these are demonic presence that God is using to bring about
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   judgment.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.920]   So he unleashes them, and he gives them specific assignments.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.440]   And so this first woe that's going to be coming out in the form of locust and through what
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.520]   they're doing is going to be tormenting the earth.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.760]   This torment is going to be so severe that the people who are affected by it are going
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.440]   to be seeking death for relief, but do not find it.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.880]   So I asked one of the questions, like, what would cause somebody to desire death and then
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.120]   not be able to find it?
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.840]   And I think that's one of the study questions that I asked you, and I'll give you an opportunity
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   to discuss it with your group.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.960]   But imagine how severe the pain is that they would have preferred death over the torment
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.120]   that they're experiencing.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.560]   So again, this is not just a simple disease.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.880]   This is excruciatingly painful, and this is not for all mankind.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.100]   It is limited to those who do not have the seal of God on them, meaning that Christians
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.280]   are covered during this period, right?
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.840]   I don't believe that they are raptured, but it's going to come upon the unbelievers, and
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.220]   it's going to be, again, intense torment.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.360]   The second woe is going to come with a demonic army riding horses, a 200 million mounted
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.600]   troops, which will ultimately wipe a third of the unrepentant humanity.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   So again, if the first woe is tormenting the people even actually seeking death, the second
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.520]   woe that's coming, the sixth trumpet, is actually going to bring a third of humanity to a stop.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.120]   They're actually going to be terminated.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.240]   So again, it kind of gives you an outline of the severity of the judgment that we're
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.160]   looking at.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:00.760]   So the fifth trumpet, the first woe, it says in verse 9-1, "The fallen star in 9-1, right?
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.000]   A fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.360]   was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit."
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.000]   Who is this angel that's falling?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.400]   Is it a person or is it a thing?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.000]   It's clearly different than the fallen angel that we see in chapter 8, verse 10, because
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.400]   chapter 8, verse 10, the angel falls and what happens?
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.120]   The water is contaminated.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.160]   So it seems like, at least the way it's described in chapter 8, verse 10, that it's a mass of
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.200]   molten material that falls on the water and contaminates, it's undrinkable.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.720]   So it doesn't seem like it's some kind of a being, but some kind of a star, maybe an
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.920]   asteroid, maybe a nuclear fallout, we don't know exactly what it is, but it's described
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.320]   as a star falling.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.720]   But in 9-1, it seems to represent a person or a being because a key is given to this
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.320]   being, and this being basically initiates this judgment by opening up the – I use
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.440]   the word "abyss" because some of your translation has the word "abyss."
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.960]   The ESV, I think, uses the word "bottomless pit," but again, the significance, the meaning
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.240]   is the same.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.920]   Now before we go any further in describing the abyss, the abyss that is being described
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.120]   here is not hell.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.120]   It is not hell.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.140]   It is not a permanent place of torment.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.920]   This is, again, different people have different ideas of what this may be, but clearly it
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.760]   is a place, a holding place of possibly demonic beings that they're being released for a
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.080]   period of time to accomplish God's purpose.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.640]   And then when that period is done, at the very end, at the White Throne Judgment, they
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.320]   will be bound for, again, before the White Throne Judgment, it says they will be bound
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   for a thousand years, possibly back in the abyss, and then when they are finally judged,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.160]   they will go into Gehenna.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   Okay?
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.320]   And that will be hell.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.760]   So what we're seeing here is not hell.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.320]   They didn't – they weren't captured in hell, and then for a period released, and then they
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.120]   go back to hell, and then they come back, and then they go back.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   Okay?
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.480]   So the abyss is different than Gehenna.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.680]   It is different than hell, just for your information.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.320]   Now who is this 9/1, this fallen angel?
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.840]   Again, it doesn't describe here, but just kind of putting two and two together, again,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.960]   different people, depending on how you approach the book of Revelation, will have different
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.840]   opinions about this.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.960]   But I think we talked about this before, especially when we studied through Isaiah.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.160]   Remember Isaiah, chapter 14, 12 through 21?
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   Okay?
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.400]   Why don't we turn our Bibles there?
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.360]   I'm not going to read the whole thing, but at least a portion of it.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.880]   Isaiah chapter 14, 12 through 21.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.920]   Okay?
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.400]   Turn your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 14.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.720]   Now some of you guys who are A students, how many of you remember the context of Isaiah
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   chapter 14?
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.720]   Who is this in reference to?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   What nation?
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   Anybody remember?
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:15.200]   I know some of you guys were in the book of Isaiah.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.480]   What kingdom?
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.960]   Starts with a B. Okay, Babylon, right?
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.900]   So chapter 14 is a judgment against Babylon, their hardiness, their arrogance.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:37.320]   And so some think that chapter 14, 12 to 21, again, in the immediate context is talking
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.740]   about Nebuchadnezzar, that in his arrogance, God's going to judge him and bring him down.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.460]   But remember when we studied through this, starting from verse 12, that if you look at
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.220]   the language, there are certain things that are stated here that can't be talking about
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.540]   a finite human being.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.500]   How are you fallen from heaven, O day star, son of dawn?
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.900]   You said in your heart, I will ascend to heaven above the stars of God.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.220]   I will set my throne on high.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.500]   I will sit on the Mount of Assembly in the far reaches of the north.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.100]   I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.060]   I will make myself the most high, but you are brought down to Sheol, to the far reaches
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.060]   of the pit.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.140]   And he goes on and on.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.300]   So many believe that this is in reference to the fall of Satan.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.100]   So possibly that the text that we're looking at in chapter 9, verse 1 is describing of
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.620]   the fall of Satan.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:31.220]   Again, in Luke chapter 10, 18, after Jesus sends out the disciples and they come back
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.460]   and they say, you know, we couldn't cast out the demons.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.540]   And in that context, again, Jesus says to them, I saw Satan fall like lightning from
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.540]   heaven.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.100]   Again, in reference to Satanic fall as he's being kicked out of heaven.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.420]   Again, the description that we see here in Isaiah.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.340]   And again, in Revelation chapter 12, verse 4, it talks about how the dragon, as he is
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.700]   again being kicked out of heaven, he drags a third of the angels with him.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:02.300]   And this is why the common belief that a third of heaven, a third of all the created angels,
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.540]   they fell along with Satan.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.700]   Meaning that Satan was that powerful.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.260]   He was the chief of the angels.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.500]   Who's the chief of the angels now?
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.980]   We talked about that last week.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:21.340]   We have Gabriel and Michael, Archangel Michael, right?
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.700]   So Archangel Michael is the chief of the angels, but even Archangel Michael in the book of
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.220]   Jude says that he doesn't directly disrespect Satan because of his power.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.380]   And he says, but the Lord rebuke you, right?
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.740]   And he cautions the church not to challenge him directly because we don't have that kind
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.020]   of power.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.000]   So in other words, he describes where that this is a very powerful being.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.980]   So in creation before the fall, Satan sat above Archangel Michael, right?
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.740]   So that's how powerful he is.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.480]   So when he fell, a third of the angels fell down with him.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:01.180]   So in chapter, again, going back to Revelation chapter 9, verse 1, okay?
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.160]   If you're not there, go back to chapter 9, verse 1.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.420]   So the beginning of the fifth or the fourth trumpet or the fifth trumpet, star fallen
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.700]   from heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.980]   Now we don't know exactly who gave it to him, but considering that he is Satan, it's probably
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.780]   some, either the Lord himself, right?
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:29.220]   Either the Lord himself, Jesus himself, or in a messenger from God is giving him permission
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.500]   to do this, right?
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.280]   So it's not like this conflict between God and Satan and we're going to try to figure
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.580]   out who wins.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.080]   Even the Satanic work that is revealed in the book of Revelation is within the context
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.720]   of God's sovereignty, right?
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.360]   God is giving him permission to carry this out.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.740]   So the first of the three woes, they seem very similar.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.800]   If you've read through the book of Joel, and I think I mentioned this maybe last week
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:07.220]   or the week before, the book of Joel is a judgment that is proclaimed upon a nation
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.020]   of Israel before the fall.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:16.040]   I mean, the Babylonians, they come in, they march against Israel, the southern kingdom,
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.100]   and before they fall, Joel is sent basically saying, "Because of your idolatry, God is
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.640]   going to judge you."
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.660]   So if you look at the language of the book of Joel of the locust judgment, you're going
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.640]   to see that there's a lot of languages very similar to what he mentions here because the
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.800]   book of Joel, we're going to review, if you've ever studied through the minor prophets, you'll
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.440]   know that the book of Joel has one of the most intense judgments recorded.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:48.180]   Some of the judgments recorded in Amos, in Isaiah, in some of the other prophets, I mean,
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.360]   they have bits and pieces of it.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.800]   The book of Joel from chapter one to the end, it's about the intensity of this judgment
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.120]   that keeps increasing, and that's what we're seeing here with this fourth judgment.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.460]   We're only about halfway through, right?
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:09.340]   But the most intense judgment described in the book of Joel is only halfway, meaning
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.420]   he's going to get even greater than this, and I'm going to give you some example.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.340]   So just to kind of give you a background of the book of Joel because it relates to what
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:23.220]   we're looking at, Israelites at this particular time in their history, before the fall, before
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:28.260]   the Babylonians come and take them, they were eagerly waiting for the day of the Lord.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.380]   And they knew that the day of the Lord was going to be a day that he was going to come
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:37.900]   and judge, but they just assumed that the judgment was going to be against their enemies,
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.380]   whether it was the Babylonians or the Assyrians or whoever was at the superpower.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.340]   So they were praying and waiting and begging the Lord for the day of the Lord.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.980]   But when Joel finally shows up saying the day of the Lord is going to come, he says,
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.300]   "You're not going to escape this judgment either, that all who disobeyed, all who strayed
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:03.660]   from God, you're not going to be saved because you were born under a certain line."
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.660]   So Joel comes in and he warns them, "The day of the Lord is going to come, but he's not
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.780]   going to come to deliver you.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.020]   He's actually going to come to judge you."
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.340]   And that's what we see in the book of Revelation.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:18.340]   Those who have the mark of the Lord will be saved, but even within the Jewish community,
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:24.340]   even within the church, remember he starts out the first two chapters of Revelation,
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.300]   he basically indicts the church.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.140]   And he's talking to people who may assume to be Christians, but he's saying then, "But
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.700]   those who overcome, those who conquer."
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   Within the church.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.260]   He doesn't just say, "All these churches have some problems that you need to fix."
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.940]   And he points out all of these things that they're guilty of and he says, "Only those
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:50.620]   who conquer, only those who persevere, only those who open the door and repent," he said,
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.340]   "they shall be saved."
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.340]   So the day of the Lord is being revealed, but this day of the Lord is going to come
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.720]   and it's going to surprise a lot of people.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.020]   Some people who thought that they were safe may find out that that wasn't the case.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.900]   And so that's the background behind the book of Joel.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.620]   Again Joel comes, declares the day of the Lord will not only bring judgment upon Israel's
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.900]   enemies but also upon Israel themselves.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.020]   So I want to show you just to kind of some of the language that's very similar to the
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.540]   book of Revelation and the book of Joel.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:30.120]   So one, Joel chapter 2, 1, it begins, or at least a part of it, it says, "Blow the trumpet
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.120]   in Zion."
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.720]   So we had some discussion last week as to the meaning of the trumpets.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:41.420]   You know how it was used to gather people to beginning of the year, various ceremonies.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.980]   But if you look at book of Joel chapter 2, 1, "Blow the trumpet in Zion, sound the alarm
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.980]   on my holy mountain.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.700]   Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the Lord is coming.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.620]   It is near a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness."
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:01.780]   So again if you read through or studied through chapter 9 before you came, you already know
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.480]   that the language of "blow the trumpet" and how that's going to bring trembling and darkness
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.560]   is going to, darkness and gloom is coming.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:21.800]   Again it's a very similar language to what we see here, right, in chapter 9.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.740]   We see the escalation of this judgment.
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.960]   So if you look at Joel chapter 1, verse 4, "What the cutting locust left, the swarming
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.920]   locust has eaten; what the swarming locust left, the hopping locust has eaten; and what
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.360]   the hopping locust left, the destroying locust has eaten."
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.120]   What is the point of this?
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.480]   What is the point that he's trying to make?
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.920]   It's going to be thorough, right?
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   It's thorough.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.240]   So that's, up to this point, isn't that what we've been seeing?
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.160]   Like he would bring judgment upon the land and then he would bring judgment upon the
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.660]   mountains, he would bring judgment upon the sky, he's bringing judgment upon the sea.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.980]   And then the wolves are going to bring judgment in torment.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:08.000]   And then the second, the fifth judgment is going to bring judgment upon man directly,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.180]   right?
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.580]   And so it's kind of escalation.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:15.620]   That this judgment isn't going to just bypass just anybody.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.460]   It's going to be a thorough judgment.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.940]   There's not going to be left any judgment for the future.
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.940]   Remember how Jesus says that?
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:31.940]   He comes in the New Testament, he says that he left certain things unpunished, right?
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.340]   The wrath of God is being stored up, the language in the New Testament.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:41.060]   Well, when we get to the day of the Lord, there's nothing being stored up anymore.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:47.460]   That it's finally going to be unleashed and it's going to be absolutely thorough.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:52.540]   Even the description of the locust itself is very similar to chapter 9, 7 through 11
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.540]   or so.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.340]   Let me read it real quick.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.660]   In appearance, the locusts were like horses prepared for battle on their heads and were
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.420]   what looked like crowns of gold.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.780]   Their faces were like human faces, their hair like women's hair and their teeth like lion's
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.780]   teeth.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.580]   They had breastplates like breastplates of iron and the noise of their wings was like
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.300]   the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.220]   They have tails and stings like scorpions and their power to hurt people for five months
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.620]   is in their tails.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.140]   They have as kings over them an angel with a bottomless pit.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:34.260]   His name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek he is called Apollonion or however that is
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.700]   pronounced.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:43.980]   So if you look at the description of the satanic or demonic army that he is unleashing upon
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.740]   mankind, again in Joel chapter 6, 1, "The nation has come upon you against my…"
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.140]   Again, this is talking about the locust army, "powerful and beyond number.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.380]   Its teeth are like lion's teeth."
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.700]   Remember reading that right there?
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.340]   And it has fangs of a lioness.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.460]   Their appearance is like the appearance of horses.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.420]   So all of this is right here.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.180]   And like war horses, they run as with the rumbling of chariots.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.880]   They leap on the top of the mountains like the crackling of the flame and all of this.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:18.100]   So again, the prophet Joel was specifically in historical context talking to the nation
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.900]   of Israel about the Babylonians coming and conquering.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:28.060]   But remember when we studied about Isaiah, that there is always threefold application
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.160]   of much of these prophecies.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.900]   One is the immediate historical context, which at that time was the Babylonians about to
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.900]   come in.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.220]   There is always a Christological fulfillment, meaning when Christ comes that he is going
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.520]   to partially fulfill some of these things.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.700]   And then the ultimate fulfillment is at the day of the Lord.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:52.020]   So we see the exact same language that was used about Babylon is now being used about
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.460]   the end times when he comes.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.540]   So the purpose of all of this language is the intensity and the thoroughness.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.740]   Now we can go in here and study like what does the woman's hair mean?
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.540]   What does the lioness teeth mean?
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.180]   And we can go through all of that and just kind of guess.
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:12.380]   Everybody has different educated guess behind what the meaning behind all of this.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:17.660]   But the overall arching meaning behind all of this is the intensity, the escalation,
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:24.540]   the thoroughness of the judgment that's coming upon mankind.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:32.060]   So the locust army is released and given the power of the scorpions, but he specifically
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.020]   limits them saying, "but not to kill."
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.140]   But to torment, but not to kill.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:43.660]   And the reason behind that ultimately is to give them opportunity to repent.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.460]   And again, that's exactly the language that we see in the book of Joel.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.140]   As intense as the judgment is, he says the judgment is coming upon Israel in order that
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.140]   they would repent.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.980]   So let me just put this up there first.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:05.260]   So the limitation that the Lord makes on this demonic army is that they are there to torture,
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:11.940]   but it's limited to five months and ultimately not to kill.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:19.660]   The book of Joel says in 1 5, "Awake you drunkards and weep and wail, all you drinkers of wine,
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.940]   because of the sweet wine for it is cut off from your mouth."
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:28.100]   In other words, the point of Joel's intense prophecy is that through the judgment, through
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.020]   the warning, that they would wake up and repent.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:38.180]   And that's the same motive here, that up to this point, again, this is not hell.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.980]   People are not being sent to hell, right?
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.860]   Or at least the ones who survive.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.940]   The goal of this is ultimately to bring them to repentance.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.900]   Joel 1 14, "Consecrate a fast, call a solemn assembly."
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:57.180]   And then he says in Joel 2 12-14, "Yet even now, even after all of this, declares the
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.540]   Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, with mourning.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.540]   Then your hearts and not your garments return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:11.100]   merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and he relents over disaster.
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.940]   Who knows whether he will not turn and relent and leave a blessing behind him, a grain of
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:20.420]   offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God."
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.420]   So even through all of this, even through all the tormenting and all the disasters,
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:31.980]   he's still trying to bring people to repentance, ultimately.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.180]   I remember when I was, again, when we visit India, we're talking to the Indian pastors
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.700]   and we're talking about the persecution in India, how it's rising.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:45.140]   And I asked them, "So how is this affecting you guys and how is it affecting the churches?"
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.460]   And they said, "Obviously, it's difficult because, you know, who wants to see their
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.380]   children being persecuted at school?
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.320]   It's one thing for them, but their wives and children also have to suffer."
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.900]   But he said that the positive of all of this is purifying the church.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.480]   The nominal, it's very difficult to be a nominal Christian in India, more and more, right?
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.020]   So it's causing people who may have been casually attending church to make a decision.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.260]   Either you're a follower of Christ or not.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:17.720]   And so if you look at the judgment up to this point, he says there's going to come a time
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:23.920]   when God is going to allow those who may be in the church, who may have never thought
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.300]   seriously about their faith and committed to their nominal belief, but when the torment
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.800]   comes, either that's going to cause you to fall or it's going to cause you to repent.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.160]   So even up to this point, even with this intense tormenting, it's really God's mercy being
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.860]   demonstrated, right?
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.860]   Even up to this point.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.560]   Remember, we didn't get to the seal judgments yet.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.000]   We didn't get to the second or third woe yet.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   That's next week.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.360]   And then once we open up the seal judgments, and then the Armageddon and the great white
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.320]   throne judgment is coming later.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.120]   We're at about halfway point.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.360]   And even to this point, God is restraining, right?
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.680]   He's restraining them.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:15.640]   He said, "Go out, torment only for five months and not to kill them."
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:21.200]   So the angel at the end of this in verse 11, and we talked about his name, the angel of
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.000]   the bottomless pit is not the same one mentioned in verse one, right?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.200]   Who's given the key to the abyss.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.880]   So many people believe that the angel is talking about in chapter nine, verse one, who's fallen,
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:38.760]   either Satan himself or maybe a high ranking angel that fell and is maybe an antichrist.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.620]   We don't know the exact.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:48.960]   But these angels that are talking about at verse 11, it says that they are king over
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.680]   them and the angel of the bottomless pit, his name in Hebrew is Abaddon.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.440]   So the Hebrew name for him is Abaddon.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:01.880]   The Greek name is Apollonian or Apollon, right?
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.400]   And both names means destruction or destroyer, right?
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.720]   And the reason why he gives a Hebrew and a Greek for the same name is again, referencing
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.840]   that this judgment is going to be universal.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.800]   That this is not just targeting outside the Jewish community.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.600]   That it's going to be universal, just like what we're talking about in the book of Joel.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.720]   They're waiting for the day of the Lord to come thinking that all their enemy is going
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.920]   to be destroyed, not realizing that the judgment is going to come to the household of Israel
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.140]   as well, right?
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.640]   So that's why there's two separate names, a Hebrew and a Greek is given for this demonic
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.880]   name.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:50.940]   So again, all of this is still within God's sovereign plan.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.240]   We look at the sixth trumpet.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:01.200]   The second will, and the intensity escalates even further, right?
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:07.400]   Just as a quick review of what he said so far, in chapter 8 verse 10, "Plagues of hail,
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.440]   fire mixed with blood that scorched the earth, burning mountain that fell into the sea, turning
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.760]   into blood, leaving death in its wake."
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:24.240]   Chapter 8 verse 8, "Blazing star from heaven falling into inland waters and causing bitterness
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.360]   and death, darkening of the sun and the moon that plunge the world into darkness."
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.560]   12, "Swarm of demonic locusts released from the abyss to torment unbelievers."
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.340]   And that's what we've seen up to this point.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:43.560]   And then finally, the sixth plague.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.860]   Up to this point, the sixth plague would be the worst.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.800]   He mentioned specifically 200 million demonic army is commissioned to wipe out a third of
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.400]   the unbelieving world.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.400]   Think about the power.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:02.720]   We don't know exactly how many, a third of the angels that were kicked out, but they
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.080]   have to be at least 200 million, right?
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:12.320]   So we're talking about, again, the power of Satan himself plus all of his angels, that
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   they're going to be out in full force, fulfilling God's ultimate purpose of judgment at the
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.500]   end.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:24.040]   But even in this, even in this, we see the mercy of God because even though it's 200
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.920]   million, at least that's the number that is given to us, and we don't know specifically
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:33.000]   what the significance of those numbers are, but it's a huge number.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.960]   But when the host of heaven is described, it says myriads upon myriads, right?
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.360]   That's the description, meaning it's countless.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:52.080]   That as big as a number of 200 million is, he said the number of servants of God in heaven
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.500]   is myriads upon myriads, meaning it can't be compared.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.800]   So even in the midst of all of this, we see his power and his sovereign control over all
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.040]   of it.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.720]   So it's not like at the very end, he's fighting against Satan and Satan is going to win.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.440]   It's like, "Oh no, he looks like he's going to win."
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.000]   And then Jesus comes in, then he conquers them.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.680]   And that is not the picture that we see in the book of Revelation.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.520]   From start to finish, God is completely sovereign.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.640]   From start to finish, God is completely sovereign.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:28.720]   Even when Satan is released, it is under his control.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:36.080]   Verse 15 points to the exact hour, day, month, and year of that, that this God has ordained,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.400]   right?
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:42.200]   The exact number of demonic force will carry out the destruction is ordained as 200 million.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.480]   And this is not just something that he was just fortune telling.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   It's God ordained.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.760]   The specific hour, the time, or the day.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.800]   Remember when they asked, "Now you're going to establish the kingdom?"
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.040]   And Jesus said, "You do not know the time or the hour.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   Only the Lord knows.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.040]   Only God knows."
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.080]   And he says, "God has appointed a specific day, a specific hour that this is going to
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.400]   happen."
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.000]   Times and seasons and visions represent the subjection of all things to God.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.240]   So as crazy as these visions and these warnings have been up to this point, all of it point
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.440]   to his sovereign plan.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.920]   In Acts 1-7, it says, "Jesus spoke of times and seasons which the Father has put in his
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.720]   own authority."
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.760]   At no point in any of this has God lost control.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:44.160]   Even Satan and his angels, they wait for that determined time for God to release them.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.400]   In fire and smoke and sulfur, it says that those are the avenues, the three plagues that
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:59.960]   this demonic force is going to use.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:07.560]   So we're looking at the end times, whenever that time may be, that it's not going to be
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.680]   a cakewalk.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.200]   So no wonder a lot of Christians are hoping that we would be raptured before then so we
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.080]   don't have to witness any of this.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.480]   We don't have to participate in any of this.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.800]   But again, I think, the language that I see is that we're going to be going through all
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.040]   of this and genuine Christians are going to be preserved through all of this, that our
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.840]   faith is going to strengthen us and we're going to be able to make it out of it.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.600]   But in the end, he said, it's going to be so devastating that the people who are under
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:43.080]   this attack, under this torment, is going to prefer death, but death is not going to
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.120]   come.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.360]   And I'm not exactly sure because obviously, you know, there's a lot of ways for somebody
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.080]   to take their life, but whatever is happening, there is no relief.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.480]   God is not allowing them to die.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:05.140]   But even in the midst of all of this, despite all these judgments, the survivors refuse
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.140]   to repent.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:11.040]   Verse 20, "The rest of mankind who are not killed by these plagues did not repent of
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.640]   the works of their hands, nor give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.880]   and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk."
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.520]   One of the discussion questions that I asked and giving time to discuss with your small
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:31.600]   group is, what would harden somebody hard to this extent that they see a third of mankind
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.920]   dying and there is no question?
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.680]   Remember, there's not going to be a question that's like, "Oh, I wonder if this is God
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.720]   or not."
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.080]   I wonder if this is God or not.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.860]   He said it's going to be very clear that this is God's judgment.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.480]   The torment is going to be God's judgment.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.360]   The demonic forces are going to be as a result of God allowing this to happen.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:55.040]   Knowing all of that, right, knowing all of that, they say they refuse to repent, they
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.480]   refuse to turn their way, right?
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:04.440]   They're so committed to sin that even in the midst of their torment, he says they refuse
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.440]   to repent.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.200]   I'm going to give you some time with your small group to discuss that, like what would
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:15.760]   cause somebody to be that hardened, that committed to their sin, right?
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   But in the end, even up to this point, even up to this point, God is trying to bring them
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   to repentance.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:28.240]   Revelation chapter 221, in one of the letters to the churches, he says, "I gave her," talking
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   about Jezebel, that even in that context, he says, "I gave her time to repent, but she
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.440]   refused to repent of her sexual immorality."
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.400]   Like all of the judgments and warning that was given to her, he said all of it was to
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.260]   bring her to repentance.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:49.080]   And again, finally, 2 Peter 3, 4-10, and I want to read this whole section for you.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.560]   Because the context in 2 Peter 3 is people asking, like you said the Lord's coming, but
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.680]   why isn't he coming, right?
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.360]   And the Christians are being mocked because he didn't come right away.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:06.040]   And so Peter is responding to that in chapter 3, 4-10, he says, "They will say, 'Where is
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.320]   the promise of his coming?'"
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.040]   Let me stop right there.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:15.320]   I mean, whether that was 2,000 years ago or today, when you talk about the second coming
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:21.000]   of Christ, non-Christians will probably mock us exactly the same way, whether it's 2,000
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.520]   years ago or now, "Oh, where is he coming?
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.560]   Oh, Jesus is really going to come."
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:30.000]   And maybe some of us, because it's been 2,000 years, and thinking like, "Oh, it just sounds
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   like a fairy tale.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.480]   It sounds like the Avengers or some imagination of some person."
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.040]   And the early church was no different.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.200]   Whether it didn't happen within the 10 or 20 or 30 years, it didn't happen 2,000 years,
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.840]   the mocking was the same.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.840]   And so he says, "Where is the promise of his coming?
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.360]   For ever since the fathers fell asleep," meaning they died, "all things are continuing as they
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.000]   were from the beginning of creation."
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.160]   Stop right there, right?
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.120]   Isn't that the same mocking today?
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:05.160]   Isn't that the same doubting today that sometimes can even creep in on us?
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:11.340]   And so we read all of this as if we're reading some history or some document that has nothing
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.340]   to do with us.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:18.040]   And he says that that's exactly how the non-Christians of the early church, they responded.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.760]   That's what unbelief looks like.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.520]   "For they deliberately overlooked this fact that the heavens existed long ago and the
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:30.480]   earth was formed out of the water and through water by the word of God and that by means
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.400]   of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.640]   But by the same word of the heaven and earth that now exists are stored up for fire, being
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.640]   kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly."
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.920]   In other words, God has an ordained time.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.760]   God ordained the creation, God ordained the restoration, right?
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:56.680]   So as creation was ordained and in God's sovereign time this happened, so will the restoration
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.600]   in God's appointed time that this is going to happen.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:05.120]   "But do not overlook this one fact, that beloved, that with the Lord one day is as
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.600]   a thousand years and a thousand years as one day."
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   Right?
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.960]   So again, I mean, think about our lives.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.920]   Think how long one year was when you were five years old.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.440]   Seemed like forever, right?
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.000]   Now a year seems like nothing.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.480]   I mean, literally, it seems like nothing.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.600]   So time is very relative depending on who you are, right?
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.200]   I mean, 10 years seemed like a long period of time.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.520]   10 years go by so quick, a decade goes by so quick.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.240]   I thought my 30s went by so quick.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.640]   40s went by like a blink.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.840]   And I can imagine it's going to speed up.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.080]   So time is very relative.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:50.120]   So imagine in God's perspective in eternity, he said a thousand years for God is going
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.160]   to be like nothing, right?
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.520]   We're looking at it from an infant's perspective and saying, "How come it didn't happen?"
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.520]   From an infant's perspective.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.960]   He said, "Do not forget who you're talking about.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.920]   You're talking about an eternal God."
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.120]   Verse 9, "The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise."
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.360]   It's not because he's not answering.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.120]   As some count slowness, right?
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.280]   Again, perspective.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:20.720]   "But is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.240]   repentance."
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:31.000]   So the whole reason why we've waited or he's been waiting and maybe possibly wait further
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.560]   is because he's been gracious.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.480]   We're living during a period of his grace.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.720]   And what we see in the book of Revelation chapter 9, and even in the midst of all of
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.560]   this judgment and disaster coming, he says the end goal is that those who survive will
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.800]   repent and come to Christ.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.560]   Because there's going to come a time when that period is going to be over.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.840]   The period of grace is going to be over.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.740]   And that there is no opportunity to repent.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.740]   There will be no survivors.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.340]   It's going to be final and complete.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.340]   We're not there yet.
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.040]   The book of Revelation is going to get us there to the white throne judgment.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.520]   We're not there yet.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.640]   But as devastating as this is, don't lose perspective, right?
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.200]   All of this is to bring us to repentance.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:17.720]   Not only for those who are going to be physically experiencing this, but even us, as we are
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.320]   reading this, as we are being warned that this is coming, that even though we may not
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:29.040]   have physically and visually experienced all of this, the goal of all of this is the same
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.660]   for us, is to bring us to repentance.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:37.480]   Whether we repent because it happens or whether we repent because it is going to happen, if
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:44.680]   we believe that this is coming, if we believe that this is coming and we really believe
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.640]   it, shouldn't it change us?
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.860]   Shouldn't it change our perspective of time, our perspective of money, our perspective
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.440]   of relationship, our perspective of fun, our perspective of life?
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.760]   It would.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.520]   And that's exactly what Peter was trying to say in Peter's, like, they're going to come
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.320]   mock you because it didn't happen according to their time, right?
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.400]   But do not know that the whole reason why you and I are alive and Christ didn't come
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.640]   and we didn't die is because there's still people to be saved.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.440]   That's the whole purpose of why you and I exist today.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.920]   While we didn't die and go to heaven, the minute that we got saved is because there's
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.140]   others that needs to come in, right?
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:37.300]   So think about how much we pray about who to marry and what job to get and what house
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.360]   to buy and all of these things.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:45.780]   Again, they're not sinful things, but how trivial they are in light of how God views
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.100]   time, right?
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:54.340]   He views time to give us opportunity to repent and give us opportunity to bring others to
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.700]   repentance, right?
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.400]   So let me read the discussion question just to kind of clarify.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.580]   Have you ever been disciplined to bring you to repentance?
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.180]   If so, when and how did that happen?
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:15.080]   Has God ever brought discipline into your life?
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.340]   Because clearly it says in book of Hebrews chapter 12, verse 6, God disciplines those
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.340]   He loves.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.720]   Have you ever experienced that and has that brought you to repentance?
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.540]   If so, when and how did that happen?
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:30.020]   So, it's difficult to fathom why someone would refuse to repent after seeing and experience
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.660]   the wrath of God as a result of their sins, but that seems to be the response at the end
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.660]   times.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.720]   The unrepentant will still, or for the majority, they're not going to repent.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.380]   What would harden people to this extent?
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:48.300]   What is the only power given to us to bring someone to repentance according to the Bible?
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.400]   I think you guys probably already know the answer to that, but I'd like you to take some
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:56.340]   time to discuss and if that's the case, what should we be investing our time doing?
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.860]   Number three, how can you discern if something is demonic work or not?
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:06.340]   Have you ever experienced anything that was clearly demonic?
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:13.620]   I think some people think that demonic activity only happens within the charismatic circle.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.360]   Demonic activity is not limited to the charismatic churches.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.120]   It just means that we're insensitive because scripture clearly says there's a spiritual
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.120]   battle.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:30.720]   So, for us to be unaware of it and not paying attention to it, it just means we become insensitive.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.960]   Clearly it's happening because the scripture says it.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:39.880]   So, the question, again, I have for you is how do you discern and is there a time when
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:44.640]   you could clearly say that this was demonic, that you identify this demonic?
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.720]   Fourth, what is something specific you can engage in today to be more spiritually aware
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.020]   and engage in the spiritual battle that we are called to fight?
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.020]   Are you aware that there's a spiritual battle?
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.760]   Are you actively engaged in this spiritual battle?
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.660]   What specific things can we participate in to be more sensitive to the spiritual battle
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.560]   and to be actively participating in this battle?
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.360]   Okay, so that's the discussion question.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   All right?
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:16.840]   Let me pray for us and then I'll let you guys go to your small group.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:22.360]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for the sober reminder of what is to come, whether
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:29.040]   that happens within our lifetime or after we fall asleep and sometime in the future.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   We know, Father God, that the end is certain and that you are a God who is completely sovereign
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.720]   over all things.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:44.000]   Help us, Lord, live day to day, consistent with the faith that we confess, that we do
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.680]   not hold on to the gospel, we do not hold on to the hope of the cross, Lord God, like
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:56.660]   a security blanket, being satisfied that we bought a free ticket to heaven.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.680]   Help us, Lord God, truly live up to the calling that you have given us.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.440]   Help us to see the world as you see it.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:08.520]   Help us, Lord God, not to be entangled with civilian affairs, that we may please the commanding
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:13.840]   officer who has called us from this empty way of life to live a life truly worthy, Lord
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.960]   God, of your calling.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.720]   So I pray that in our discussion that your Holy Spirit would guide and lead us, that
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.340]   you would allow our hearts to be softened to hear your word.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:30.240]   Help us, Lord God, to speak the truth in love to one another, that we may sharpen one another,
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.440]   how to spur one another on toward love and good deeds.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.520]   Lord, we are weak in our flesh, but we know that you are strong in the Spirit.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.920]   So we pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit would lead and guide.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.560]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
