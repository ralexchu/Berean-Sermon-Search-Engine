[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.160]   For those of you guys who are either by the door,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   please make your way to your tables.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.160]   It's really exciting to see all of you guys here.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   The room is so full and ready to study together.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.160]   So per our usual just setup and schedule for the evening,
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   we'll have our time of worship and then go straight
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   into our time of discussion with our groups.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160]   Would you please join with me as we take a moment to pray
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.160]   and go before the Lord?
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.160]   Let's pray.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.160]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   God, we thank you for your mercies,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   the strength that you give,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.160]   and the provision you grant to us every single day.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.160]   And we know, God, that you have ordained it,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   that we would receive strength and nourishment
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   and more from your word.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   So what a privilege it is to come together
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   to fellowship in this way, to dig through the scriptures,
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.160]   to share our insights,
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.160]   and I pray that it would be so fruitful to us.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   And God, as you see the church coming together
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   over your truths, I pray, God, that you would be pleased
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.160]   and that all that we do is honoring to you, God.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.160]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.

[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:50.160]   There where the blood of the Lamb was spilled.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:56.160]   Grace, grace, God's grace,
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:02.160]   Grace that will pardon and cleanse within.

[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   Grace that is greater than all I say.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   [Guitar playing]

[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:43.160]   You who are longing to see His face,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:49.160]   Will you this moment His grace receive?
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:55.160]   Grace, grace, God's grace,
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:01.160]   Grace that will pardon and cleanse within.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:07.160]   Grace, grace, God's grace,

[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   [Guitar playing]
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.160]   Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:36.160]   What can avail to wash it away?
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   Look, there is flowing a crimson tide,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   Wider than snow you may be today.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   Grace, grace, God's grace,
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   Grace that will pardon and cleanse within.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.160]   Grace, grace, God's grace,
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:12.160]   Grace that is greater than all I say.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   Grace that is greater than all I say.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:38.160]   [Guitar playing]
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:53.160]   The greatest treasure of my longing soul,
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   My God, like you there is no other,
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   A true delight is found in you alone.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   Your grace, well too deep to fathom,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:23.160]   Your love exceeds the heavens' reach,
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   Your truth a fount of perfect wisdom,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:37.160]   My highest good and my unending need.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   [Guitar playing]
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:55.160]   O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   Strong defender of my weary heart,
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   My sword to fight the cruel deceiver,
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   And my shield against his hateful dots.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   My song when enemies surround me,
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   My hope when tides of sorrow rise,
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   My joy when trials are abounding,
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   Your faithfulness my refuge in the night.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   [Guitar playing]
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   Gracious savior of my ruined life,
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   My guilt and cross laid on your shoulders,
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:27.160]   In my place you suffered, bled, and died.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   You rose, the grave and death are conquered,
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   You broke my bonds of sin and shame.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:49.160]   You rose, you rose, the grave and death are conquered,
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   You broke my bonds of sin and shame.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.160]   O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   May all my days bring glory to your name.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   May all my days bring glory to your name.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.160]   Let's pray.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   Heavenly Father, God, we praise you because you are our rock and our redeemer.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.160]   Lord, you sent your Son to redeem us from our sin.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.160]   God, to save us from death.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   And God, we praise you for that.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   And we thank you for the love and the grace that you showed to us on the cross.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.160]   Lord, I pray that as we jump back into Galatians,
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.160]   as we study through your word,
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.160]   convict us of the truth,
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.160]   and God, strengthen us to apply it into our lives,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   that we might grow in our reflection of you,
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.160]   in our imitation of you,
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   and just be faithful in our walks, Lord.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   So I thank you for tonight.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.160]   Okay.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.160]   Well, we're going to go right into our time of sharing and discussion.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.160]   Since it is the first one for this second half,
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   please do talk a bit about what are the major themes and movements that you saw.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   But then go ahead and talk about the observations and questions you made
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   from chapter 4, verse 1 through 7.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   We'll be back in just about 35, 40 minutes.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   Thanks.

[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   As you guys are getting situated, that right there up top is my cell phone number.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:24.360]   If as we are studying the passage you have questions about the text,
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.360]   there's a theological concept that's coming out that you're curious about,
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:35.360]   you can text me directly and after the main teaching portion,
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.360]   I'll go ahead and answer some of the questions that you guys may have.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.360]   If it's a complicated question and it's difficult for you to text it,
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.360]   just raise your hand and I'm going to give an opportunity for you to just ask it
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.360]   while we do the study, okay?
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   Well, let's take a moment to pray and then jump into the review of the passage
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.360]   that we just discussed, okay? Let's pray together.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:08.360]   Lord, sometimes God, as we study, you remind us of the treasure of the gospel
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   in different imageries and in different light.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.360]   Sometimes in case in such a short passage, but to our hearts, Lord God,
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:25.360]   what an encouragement, how we're edified, God, by seeing your love executed over time,
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:33.360]   overcoming all kinds of difficulties with your power in my exercise in Christ for our benefit.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.360]   So as we meditate and think about it tonight, Lord, we just want to thank you
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.360]   and pray for a fruitful time of study. It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:48.360]   Okay. What I'd like to do first is since we are starting this series,
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:54.360]   let's do a bit of a brief review, okay?
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.360]   Before we do a review, I want to ask the question, easy toss-up softball question.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.360]   Anybody, especially right up here in the front.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.360]   What was the tone of chapters one through three that we studied last session?
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:12.360]   What was the tone? Anyone, anyone? Daniel, sitting right in front of me.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:26.360]   [inaudible]
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.360]   Good. Okay. Good. He said there was rebuking.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   There was some explaining, an explanation of how, like, you know,
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.360]   they were acting and what implications that has.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.360]   So in many ways, yeah, actually the way I would like to summarize it is
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   it was a lot of, "What are you doing?"
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.360]   That was the tone.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.360]   And actually, when you think about, you know,
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.360]   various portions of where the text was,
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.360]   he would ask all these questions that were very rhetorical, like,
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.360]   "And do you remember how this worked?" Right?
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   "And how did you come to know this thing?"
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.360]   And then a lot of it was, "What are you doing?"
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.360]   "And what are you allowing the Judaizers to do?"
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.360]   A portion of the text that was important as right at the get-go was
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.360]   in verse 6 through 9, where he said,
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.360]   "I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him."
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.360]   He used language of betrayal.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.360]   "Who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel,
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.360]   which is really not another.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.360]   Only there are some who are disturbing you
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.360]   and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ."
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   Schemes of the devil that we should be aware of.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.360]   People who will discourage, disturb, cause us to wonder, like,
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   "Am I really a Christian? Do I need to do more?"
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.360]   He would distort not always this radical falsehood,
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.360]   but rather just a little bit of perversion.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.360]   Verse 8, "But even if we or an angel from heaven
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.360]   should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you,
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.360]   he is to be accursed.
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   And we have said before, so I say again now,
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.360]   if any man is preaching to a gospel contrary to what you received,
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.360]   he is to be accursed."
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.360]   Strong, strong language that we heard.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.360]   And by way of this, I just want to say,
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   it was very, very convicting for us in our last session
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.360]   that we were challenged there has to be a level
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   of faithfulness and accuracy to the gospel of Christ, amen?
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   There has to be a level of faithfulness and accuracy
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.360]   to all that we find in Scripture.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.360]   It is our job and duty to make sure that we're digging and studying
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.360]   and then to be as loyal as possible.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.360]   And yes, maybe there are those who will actually
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.360]   discourage us from doing that.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.360]   Actually, I feel like the way that we're discouraged
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.360]   is people saying, "Why do you study the Bible so much?
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.360]   It's like you idolize the Bible and not Jesus.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.360]   Oh my gosh, you're all about accuracy and make it biblical.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.360]   In the end, you're just causing division.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.360]   What are you doing?"
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.360]   I feel like to us, it's like a weird perversion that way to us.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.360]   And maybe some of them are accusing you like,
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.360]   "I bet your pastor is talking all cultish and preparing you like,
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.360]   oh, you know, you're going to be persecuted by this and that
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.360]   and you're like, oh yeah."
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:13.360]   But actually for us, the accuracy and hanging on every word of Jesus
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.360]   is to us our love for the Lord.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.360]   It's our appreciation that what God has given to us in the gospel
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.360]   is something that we will dare not pervert, amen?
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.360]   So with that said, Apostle Paul talking about how important
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.360]   the message is, went on a long kind of rehearsing
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.360]   of his journey, of the way that he got his message.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.360]   And he said, "You know my life. You know my message.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.360]   You know my ministry. You know where I've been.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.360]   You know what happened in Jerusalem.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   And you know that my message came from...
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.360]   And the answer is...
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.360]   Yes?
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.360]   Yes. Say it with confidence.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.360]   From Christ directly, from God.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.360]   He did not get it from any man.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.360]   And that was a big portion of the text that we studied.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.360]   And then he started to teach and explain
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:09.360]   that not by law, but justification is by Christ, by the Spirit.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.360]   It has to be by faith.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.360]   And here we get the passage in Galatians 2, 19 through 21,
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.360]   which probably a lot of you have devoted to memory.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.360]   It's totally worth devoting to memory.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.360]   "For through the law I died for the law,
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360]   so that I might live to God.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.360]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.360]   It is no longer I who live,
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.360]   but Christ lives in me.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.360]   And the life which I now live in the flesh,
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.360]   I live by the faith in the Son of God,
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.360]   who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   I do not nullify the grace of God,
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.360]   for if righteousness came through the law,
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.360]   then Christ died needlessly."
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.360]   So we have this pivotal passage.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   And then we left off here in chapter 3, verse 22 to 29,
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.360]   where it says, "But the scripture has shut up everyone under sin,
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.360]   so that the promise by faith in Christ Jesus
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.360]   might be given to those who believe.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.360]   But before faith came, explain to us,
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.360]   what is the role of the law then?
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.360]   Is the law bad?"
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360]   It says, "No, we were kept in custody under the law,
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   being shut up to the faith, which was later to be revealed.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.360]   Therefore, the law has become our tutor
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.360]   to lead us to Christ,
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.360]   so that we may be justified by faith.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.360]   But now that faith has come,
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.360]   we are no longer under a tutor,
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus."
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.360]   That was the last portion that we studied in the previous text.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.360]   Then looking forward, in preview of chapters 5 through 6,
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.360]   we are hitting the latter half,
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.360]   and I want to ask you this question again.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.360]   How do you feel like the latter half reads in terms of tone?
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.360]   When you look at chapters 4 through 6,
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.360]   what is the feel?
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.360]   Any volunteers?
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:02.360]   I'm going to pick on the tables right in the front row, okay?
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.360]   Tim, what do you think?
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:18.360]   You want to do a pass?
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.360]   All right.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.360]   What do you think, Isaac?
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   I would say maybe more on the encouraging side.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   More encouraging side?
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.360]   Hmm.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.360]   Because what I read
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   was a whole lot of, "Man, I fear that I've labored in vain."
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.360]   There was a lot of pleading, a lot of begging.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.360]   Like, "I beg you. Who disturbed you?"
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   And then this question of like,
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   where is that sense of feeling blessed?
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.360]   Where is your celebration, knowing what you have?
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.360]   And then he even says, "I'm perplexed by you," right?
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:59.360]   So in that way, encouraging, yes.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.360]   It's a bit of a...
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   It's a little bit of more of that kind of rebuking,
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   still like frustration.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.360]   And I'm making a point of that
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.360]   because as I was trying to meditate through,
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   yeah, this passage or this text,
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   the book is actually quite argumentative.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.360]   There's a lot of arguments within the text, yes?
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   And so I want you to know that as a preview of what's to come,
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.360]   actually one-third of what we'll study this session
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.360]   is going to still sound heavy doctrine and heavy argumentative,
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.360]   trying to reason with you.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.360]   This doesn't make sense if you do this.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.360]   And then there's a little bit of the,
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.360]   "How dare you? What are you thinking?"
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.360]   kind of feel to Apostle Paul's preaching.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.360]   And I'm going to comment on that a little bit later.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.360]   I'm actually giving you a little bit of the...
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.360]   Also, I'll post, just like Pastor Peter Chung did,
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.360]   I'll post the slides.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360]   But when you look at Chapter 4,
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   he describes what we have in Christ
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.360]   as a privilege of being adopted.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.360]   And then he starts asking, "So what's going on?"
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.360]   Right?
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.360]   And then he starts to reason that
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360]   through the Old Testament example,
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.360]   but also just the lineage of the fact
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.360]   that there was two lines.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.360]   And then he pushes the fact that we're free.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   And then so he challenges and says,
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.360]   "We must stand firm."
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:25.360]   Pay special attention to the concepts
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   of freedom as children of God
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.360]   in this next segment that we'll be studying.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.360]   In the middle of it,
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.360]   he'll give the challenges of what that all means
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.360]   and how it is to be played out,
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.360]   that as we're not under the law but rather free,
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.360]   we're being moved by the Spirit.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.360]   And so the idea is that we're going to be
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:47.360]   bearing fruits of the Spirit in application.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:50.360]   And then it was so cool
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.360]   because there is this closing few little lines
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:58.360]   where he just ends with a crazy, crazy mic drop
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.360]   where he says, "You know what?
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.360]   "This topic I've taught you,
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.360]   "don't speak to me about this anymore."
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.360]   And he goes, "I bear on my body
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.360]   "the brand marks of Christ."
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.360]   Mic drop.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   That's how he kind of ends the thing
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.360]   and gives closing graces.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.360]   So that's just a preview real briefly
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.360]   of what's to come in this series.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.360]   Let's take a look then
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.360]   at Galatians 4, 1 through 7.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.360]   So when we take a look at this segment,
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.360]   you guys have been discussing it already
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.360]   for the last 40 minutes.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.360]   And I would break it down
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   into three distinct little segments.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.360]   Clearly, he uses the analogy of a child.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.360]   And then he points to your spirituality, you too.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.360]   We're also like this child.
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.360]   But God, like the Father.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.360]   But the pushing point of this paragraph,
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.360]   it's tied to the next.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.360]   So as a heads up,
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.360]   next week's passage goes up to verse 14.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.360]   And it's all supposed to be studied together.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.360]   But for the sake of our own diving and digging,
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360]   we took it in two pieces.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.360]   But the push here is you are no longer slaves,
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.360]   but a son.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.360]   And therefore, heirs.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.360]   And if you're doing meditation,
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.360]   application, and thinking through
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.360]   how does that theology impact me,
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.360]   that I am not to see myself as
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.360]   just simply a former slave or an employee.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.360]   We are rightly slaves of Christ
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.360]   and we are rightly bond servants of God.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.360]   Amen?
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.360]   But the identity we have
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.360]   is that we are sons of the Heavenly Father.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.360]   So we begin with first the analogy.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360]   And he says,
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360]   "Now I say,
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.360]   "as long as the heir is a child,
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.360]   "he does not differ at all from a slave,
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.360]   "although he is owner of everything.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360]   "But he is under guardians and managers
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.360]   "until the date set by the Father."
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.360]   As we take a look at this analogy,
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.360]   we have to ask the question,
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.360]   okay, so he throws in quite a lot in there,
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.360]   but what is the point of the analogy
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.360]   that relates to this child, okay?
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.360]   To this child.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.360]   And there's quite a lot.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.360]   In the beginning here,
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.360]   when he starts talking about as an heir,
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.360]   that actually kind of threw me off, right?
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.360]   So the reason why it threw me off is,
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.360]   okay, so he's already an heir, right?
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.360]   But his actual main point is,
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.360]   no, he's like a slave, right?
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.360]   Even if he was an heir,
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.360]   right now because of his age
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.360]   and circumstances, et cetera.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.360]   All right, I'm not gonna mess with this
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.360]   'cause this is gonna,
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.360]   all right, he's a slave, right?
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.360]   So one thing that we should notice
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.360]   in asking the question,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.360]   what is the point of the analogy,
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.360]   is clearly the repeat idea
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.360]   that the individual who is a young child
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.360]   is under guardianship, under strict manager,
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.360]   and is like a slave.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360]   As a matter of fact, the way he puts it is,
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.360]   doesn't differ from a slave at all, yes?
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.360]   So we are thinking in our minds then,
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.360]   we're thinking no privileges,
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360]   we're thinking heavy limits,
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.360]   we're thinking no money,
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.360]   no access to the resources of the father,
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.360]   is like a slave child.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.360]   It is getting instructed like a slave.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   That's the idea, right?
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.360]   But the other idea here
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.360]   that is introduced to us,
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.360]   which is to us probably more important
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.360]   in this paragraph,
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.360]   is the idea of the time,
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.360]   that there is a specific date
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.360]   set by the father, okay?
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.360]   That's the analogy.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360]   There is a temporary period
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.360]   by which God the father is planning.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360]   And that's what I want us to keep in mind
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   as we think through this analogy.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360]   So then, if I were to summarize that,
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360]   I would say,
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.360]   you know what it is?
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.360]   I think this thing may have frozen.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.360]   Okay, here we go.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.360]   A child is like a slave
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.360]   until the time that the father has set.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.360]   Okay?
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   Let's move quickly into the next portion
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   about the spiritual reality.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.360]   So, also we,
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.360]   while we were children,
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   were held in bondage
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.360]   under the elemental things of the world.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   But when the fullness of the time came,
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360]   God sent forth his son,
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.360]   born of a woman,
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360]   born under the law,
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.360]   so that he might redeem those
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.360]   who were under the law,
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.360]   that we might receive the adoption as sons.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.360]   So, here we have lots to think about.
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.360]   Okay?
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.360]   Lots to ask.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.360]   In what way were we like the child?
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360]   In what ways is this analogy
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360]   connecting to our spiritual reality?
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.360]   We have to ask those questions.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.360]   And immediately,
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.360]   I'm guessing a lot of you guys
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360]   saw this passage as,
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.360]   you know what?
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.360]   This is just a beautiful,
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360]   beautiful picture of the gospel.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.360]   Thinking, before we were Christian,
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360]   we were like slaves, right?
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.360]   We're under the elemental
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:00.360]   and we have strict masters over us.
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.360]   Right?
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.360]   That's the way we're thinking about it.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360]   But praise be to God,
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.360]   he sends his son,
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.360]   so that we would receive sonship.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.360]   Boom.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.360]   It's such a short,
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.360]   encapsulated, beautiful picture
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.360]   of gospel salvation.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.360]   But we ask this question of,
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   okay, so there are a lot of
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.360]   beautiful analogies for the gospel
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   and the scriptures,
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.360]   everything from being born again,
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:29.360]   but what are all of these,
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.360]   I guess, elements?
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.360]   First and foremost,
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.360]   we ask this question in thinking about
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.360]   our pre-converted state,
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.360]   what are the elemental things of the world?
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.360]   And what is the nature
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   and description of this bondage
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.360]   in our prior to Christ circumstance?
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.360]   Well,
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.360]   take a moment to turn your Bible
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.360]   over to Colossians chapter two,
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.360]   and it gives us various passages,
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.360]   okay, Colossians chapter two,
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.360]   that describe at length,
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.360]   what are some of the elemental things
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.360]   of the world that we should
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.360]   not be captivated by?
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.360]   So,
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.360]   the first passage is verse eight,
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:10.360]   Colossians chapter two, verse eight.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.360]   It says, "See to it that no one
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.360]   "takes you captive through philosophy
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:16.360]   "and empty deception,
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.360]   "according to the traditions of men,
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.360]   "according to the elementary principles
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.360]   "of the world rather than to Christ."
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.360]   So here it describes it as
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.360]   any kind of philosophy,
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.360]   any kind of deception
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.360]   that the world lives by.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:31.360]   And then in verse 16 of chapter two,
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.360]   it goes further to describe,
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.360]   "Therefore, no one is to act as your judge
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.360]   "in regards to food, to drink,
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.360]   "or in respect to festival,
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360]   "or moon, or Sabbath day,
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   "things which are mere shadows
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.360]   "of what is to come,
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.360]   "but the substance belongs to Christ.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.360]   "Let no one keep defrauding you
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.360]   "of your prize by delighting
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.360]   "in self-abasement,
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.360]   "the worship of angels,
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360]   "the passions as he's seen
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360]   "inflated without cause
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.360]   "by his fleshly mind."
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.360]   And then turn your eyes to verse 20 and 23.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.360]   Verse 20 and 23.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.360]   It says, "If you've died with Christ
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.360]   "to the elementary principles
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.360]   "of the world,
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.360]   "why, as if you're living in the world,
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.360]   "do you submit to decrees
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.360]   "such as do not handle,
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.360]   "do not taste, do not touch,
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   "which all refer to things
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.360]   "destined to perish with use,
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.360]   "in accordance with commandments
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.360]   "and teachings of men?"
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.360]   So there's an important part right there.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.360]   Any kind of teaching philosophy
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.360]   or policy even,
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.360]   of organizations, institutions,
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.360]   whoever they may be,
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.360]   that have just simply
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360]   like an element of
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360]   it's us playing in our playground,
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   these things are elementary principles.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.360]   You guys probably did the,
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.360]   you know, the dictionary study
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.360]   of what the word means.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   The word means stuff that's rudimentary.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.360]   It literally means stuff that's basic.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.360]   So you're thinking stuff like
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.360]   A, B, C, D, E, F, G, right?
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.360]   These are all such small, miniscule things.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.360]   And I imagine the reason why
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.360]   they use the kind of analogy
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.360]   of the playground is 'cause
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.360]   that's what I imagine God seeing it as.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.360]   You've got kids, little puny, tiny kids,
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   like kindergarteners,
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.360]   playing with each other, creating what?
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   You can't drink your tea like that.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.360]   You have to write papers like this.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.360]   You know, they're like,
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.360]   within little playgrounds, they're bossy kids.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.360]   You gotta play by my rules.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.360]   All of those are what?
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.360]   Elementary principles.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.360]   And to think that them doing that,
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.360]   somehow they're offering that
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.360]   as righteousness before God,
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.360]   it's all garbage.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   It's like little kids washing their hands
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.360]   and being like, "Look, Daddy, I'm clean."
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.360]   No, you're not.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.360]   These are all elementary principles, okay?
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:58.360]   Now, here, in the context, though,
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.360]   for the Jewish people,
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.360]   the people that were Judaizers,
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.360]   all the elementary principles
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.360]   had to do with the worthless things,
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.360]   in verse nine it says,
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360]   and these had to do with things
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.360]   like the necessity of circumcision,
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.360]   laws that they had to follow, okay?
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.360]   Now, why do I mention this?
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360]   One important thing I wanna mention is,
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:25.360]   here, to us, it just reads
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.360]   bondage under the elementary,
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.360]   elemental things of the world,
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:32.360]   but one of the things I want to highlight is,
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:36.360]   so this has been going on since the fall, okay?
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.360]   The systems of man, the principles,
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.360]   the whatever, like,
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.360]   things that they came up with,
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.360]   their rules,
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.360]   that has been what's going on
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.360]   since the fall, okay?
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   'Cause what I wanna ask now is,
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.360]   in this passage, starting from verse three to five,
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.360]   what is the emphasis we need to understand
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:02.360]   about this big, encapsulated gospel teaching?
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.360]   What do I mean by that question?
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.360]   Here, we have everything the gospel has,
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.360]   your pre-converted state,
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.360]   that in the fullness of time,
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.360]   God sent his son so that we would be redeemed.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.360]   What is it that we're supposed
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360]   to really, really appreciate, okay?
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.360]   And what I'm gonna say is,
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.360]   within here, what we have is,
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.360]   in terms of salvation,
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.360]   we have the how of salvation here.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.360]   That God sent his son,
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.360]   who was born of a woman,
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.360]   so fully human, able to take our place
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.360]   in every respect,
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360]   born under the law with such humility
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.360]   that he would place himself
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.360]   under the stipulation so that
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.360]   he can fulfill its requirements for righteousness,
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.360]   but also he could take upon
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.360]   the curses of the law, yes?
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.360]   This is the how.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.360]   We also have the purpose
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.360]   that God wanted to redeem
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.360]   and that we would receive adoption,
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.360]   so this is the purpose, yes?
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.360]   But are these two things
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.360]   the emphasis that we're supposed to catch?
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.360]   I'm gonna say that the emphasis
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.360]   we're supposed to catch is here,
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.360]   the fullness of time.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.360]   Let me speak to this a little bit
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.360]   as what I'm saying is this.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.360]   Earlier, I was saying
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.360]   this idea of bondage
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.360]   that we, under the elemental things
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.360]   of the world,
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.360]   we're supposed to feel like, yes,
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.360]   we were underneath that bondage
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.360]   so long as mankind
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.360]   has been under the fall.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.360]   And what's more,
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.360]   the emphasis here is given
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.360]   that the plan and purpose of God
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.360]   has been meticulously then executed
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.360]   that God in his own wisdom
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360]   would prepare that, yes,
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.360]   the fullness of man's sin,
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.360]   the instruction from his law,
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.360]   the preparing of his people,
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360]   the nation of Israel,
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.360]   and the teaching that our flesh
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.360]   is incapable,
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.360]   that all those things had to happen
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.360]   for the fullness of time to come.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.360]   In other words,
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.360]   for us,
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.360]   we're supposed to feel
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360]   this element like
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360]   you were previously children
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.360]   waiting for your independence.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.360]   You were previously children
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.360]   waiting for that time
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.360]   you were actually privileged
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:14.360]   inheritance, right?
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.360]   So by way of analogy,
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.360]   what we're supposed to appreciate is
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.360]   if, let's say,
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.360]   we were thinking, oh my gosh,
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.360]   like we were just kids
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.360]   so eagerly wanting to drive.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.360]   You had pictures of cars on your wall.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.360]   You wanted to wait for that time.
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.360]   You were begging your parents,
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.360]   can you take me out and teach me?
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.360]   You didn't have money,
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:38.360]   but you're asking your parents,
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.360]   could I please have money
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.360]   for the driver's ed?
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.360]   You waited for all of that.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.360]   The day came,
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.360]   you got your driver's license once more,
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.360]   your father gave the car,
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.360]   and in that moment
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.360]   when you're finally able to drive,
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360]   that sentiment,
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:57.360]   that feeling of appreciation
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.360]   of the fulfilling of your desire,
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.360]   that's what we're supposed to feel.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:04.360]   Does that make sense?
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.360]   But then to think,
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.360]   remember how earlier I said
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   the tone,
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.360]   but then to think
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.360]   from God's perspective,
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:17.360]   to have all that preparation done,
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360]   to have that long journey
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.360]   of teaching and getting you ready
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.360]   and getting all the things
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.360]   for Christ ready,
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360]   for them to have known
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360]   this gospel of Christ,
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.360]   of reconciliation,
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.360]   the beautiful gospel of redemption,
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360]   the beautiful gospel of adoption,
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.360]   and then for them to be tempted like,
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.360]   oh, you know what though,
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.360]   I have this long-waited revelation of Christ,
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.360]   but that guy said
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.360]   we still have to wash our hands.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.360]   That guy said we still have to be circumcised.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.360]   Why?
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.360]   Another way to put it is
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.360]   to think God,
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.360]   the adoptive father,
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.360]   preparing his home,
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.360]   readying the room,
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.360]   readying everything
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.360]   to receive the child,
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.360]   and then for the child to think,
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:08.360]   is this right?
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360]   Is this what I wanted?
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.360]   How could God feel
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.360]   anything but betrayed in that?
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:17.360]   Right?
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.360]   We should meditate on how God feels about that,
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.360]   and again,
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360]   I think that's one of the reasons why,
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.360]   here,
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.360]   pushing that idea
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360]   of the fulfillment,
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360]   the fullness of time
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.360]   being so emphatic.
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.360]   In the next segment,
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.360]   he does say,
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360]   "You were slaves to those
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.360]   "by which our nature know God,
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.360]   "but now that you have come to know God,
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360]   "or rather to be known by God,
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.360]   "how is it you're turning back again
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.360]   "to the weak and worthless elemental things
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.360]   "to which you desire to be enslaved
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.360]   "all over again?"
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.360]   Right?
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.360]   And so in that way,
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.360]   I would summarize that middle section
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.360]   as you were slaves redeemed by Christ,
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.360]   emphasis on the fullness of time.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.360]   Next,
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.360]   we look at verse six through seven,
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.360]   and then he says,
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.360]   "So, because you are sons,
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360]   "God has sent forth the spirit of his Son
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:17.360]   "into our hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father.'
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.360]   "Therefore, you are no longer a slave,
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360]   "but a son.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.360]   "And if a son,
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360]   "then an heir through God."
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360]   So here,
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360]   we have this gospel truth
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.360]   that through redemption in Christ,
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360]   we receive the Spirit,
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.360]   and more specifically here,
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360]   we receive the Spirit of Jesus in our hearts,
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.360]   a spirit of sonship
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360]   by which we're able to cry,
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360]   "Abba, Father,"
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.360]   calling on the name of the Lord.
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:48.360]   And then the point is really, really clear.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.360]   There isn't necessarily
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.360]   a deep, deep explanation that needs to happen
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:54.360]   to logically say
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.360]   that if you're not a slave,
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.360]   but rather you are a son,
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.360]   then that means you are an heir,
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.360]   meaning you are going to receive God's blessing.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.360]   You're going to receive
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.360]   the inheritance for you
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.360]   that He has prepared, yes?
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.360]   Then our job here,
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.360]   when it's so clear,
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.360]   is to think and meditate about
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.360]   then to what degree do I appreciate this?
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.360]   To what degree am I aware of this?
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.360]   How much assurance do I truly have
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360]   that God is my Father,
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360]   that my relationship with Him is clear,
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.360]   so clear that when I go
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.360]   to take the privilege
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.360]   and to essentially claim my rights as a son,
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.360]   there wouldn't be this,
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.360]   "And who are you?"
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.360]   The scripture,
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.360]   when it talks about our sonship,
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.360]   again, for us,
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360]   a huge edification
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.360]   of the assurances we have in the gospel.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.360]   And another way to think about this
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.360]   is sometimes
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.360]   we don't appreciate
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360]   what we have
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.360]   in the grace and mercies of God
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.360]   until we think about it the other way.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.360]   Just imagining and hypothesizing,
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.360]   what if we have salvation?
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.360]   Meaning we're not gonna experience
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.360]   the wrath of God,
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.360]   but we don't have sonship.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.360]   What if we escape the fires of hell,
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:13.360]   but we're actually not His son?
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360]   I remember
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.360]   in the gospels,
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.360]   as it talks about the woman
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.360]   who wanted healing for her daughter,
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.360]   remember she comes to Jesus
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.360]   pleading and requesting.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.360]   And what's really interesting is
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360]   Jesus says something so profoundly rude.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.360]   And He says,
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:32.360]   "You take what is meant for the children
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.360]   "and give it to dogs."
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.360]   Do you remember what the woman said?
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.360]   At least the dogs, though,
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.360]   sometimes eat when the food falls
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.360]   from the table, right?
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.360]   I'm paraphrasing there.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.360]   But you think about that a little bit,
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.360]   and to this woman's credit,
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.360]   her faith said,
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:55.360]   "I will gladly be a dog in your home.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:58.360]   "I'll gladly be your dog."
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.360]   And what's crazy about that
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:04.360]   is she was spot on, right?
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.360]   To be under the,
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.360]   I guess,
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.360]   to have a master like God.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:12.360]   And what's more,
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.360]   there's another example I think about.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.360]   Thinking about the parable
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:18.360]   of the prodigal son.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.360]   When the younger son who goes off
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:22.360]   and squanders the father's riches,
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.360]   do you remember what he said in his heart?
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.360]   He said,
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.360]   "It would be better for me to go back
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.360]   "and I will go and say to him,
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.360]   "Father, I'm unworthy to be called your son.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   "Make me as a hired man."
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.360]   Again,
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.360]   spot on.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.360]   "I would much rather be a servant
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.360]   "of this master who is trustworthy,
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.360]   "good, powerful, and rich
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.360]   "than anybody else.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.360]   "Make me your servant."
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.360]   But then,
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.360]   as the story goes,
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.360]   before he even gets a chance to say anything,
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.360]   the father comes running,
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.360]   embraces him and says,
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.360]   "Let's rejoice."
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.360]   The son says,
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.360]   "I'm not worthy.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.360]   "I am not worthy to be your son."
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.360]   When we think like that,
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.360]   when we think,
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.360]   "Man, I'd rather be your servant,
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.360]   "your hired man.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.360]   "Give me a toothbrush.
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.360]   "I'll clean the barracks.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.360]   "I'll clean the bathroom with the toothbrush.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.360]   "Whatever you give me,
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.360]   "I'd rather be a servant in your house."
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.360]   "You didn't choose,
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.360]   "but I desired to take you in
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.360]   "as my own child."
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.360]   That's incredible.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.360]   That's incredible.
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.360]   And it's so powerful.
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:40.360]   I pray and hope,
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.360]   and I pray that
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.360]   if any of you guys do struggle
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.360]   with a lack of assurance,
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.360]   if any of you guys do actually struggle with,
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.360]   in many ways,
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.360]   just trusting the heart of God,
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:54.360]   let this speak to you.
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.360]   Let's find God's plan from long ago
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.360]   for the fullness of time to come
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.360]   to, yes, sacrifice so deeply
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:05.360]   that he would send his only begotten son
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.360]   all for the purpose of having you
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.360]   also as his child.
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:13.360]   That's mind-blowing, amen?
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.360]   And it's so powerful.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.360]   It will cause you
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.360]   to be so reassured.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360]   Take my stuff.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.360]   I'll inherit some of my father.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:25.360]   Right?
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.360]   Do whatever you will.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.360]   I have the inheritance of my father.
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:33.360]   And so, in that way, I pray
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.360]   that we would have such, such comfort,
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.360]   assurance, security, and power.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.360]   I ask you this question.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.360]   How does your spiritual identity
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.360]   as a child of God affect you?
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.360]   What are the implications for your thoughts
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.360]   when there are moments
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.360]   when you're struggling?
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.360]   There are so many things that attack us
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.360]   in terms of the devil taking opportunity
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.360]   to scheme to cause you to waver.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.360]   One-time sin, repeated sins,
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.360]   the fact that sometimes you feel like
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.360]   you're not growing as fast as you could be,
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.360]   other people's criticism of you,
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.360]   your own suffering,
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.360]   all of these various things attack you
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.360]   and make you wonder, "Does God see me?
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:17.360]   "Oh my gosh, am I really a child of God?"
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.360]   Satan will attack you at every turn, yes?
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.360]   Please make sure that this, to you, is assured.
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:27.360]   Scripture says in Romans 8, 15 through 17,
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.360]   "For you have not received the spirit of slavery,
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.360]   "leaving to fear,
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.360]   "but you have received the spirit of adoption,
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:36.360]   "a son by which you cry, 'Abba, Father.'
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.360]   "The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:41.360]   "that we are children of God.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.360]   "And if children, heirs also,
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.360]   "heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ,
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.360]   "if indeed we suffer with Him
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.360]   "so that we may also be glorified with Him."
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:52.360]   So we have this great, great truth for us today.
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.360]   As we're thinking about this segment,
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:58.360]   you have people who are essentially being swayed to think,
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:01.360]   "Maybe if I just keep going with the crowd, I'll be saved.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.360]   "Oh shoot, do I need to do something with my body?
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:07.360]   "Oh shoot, do I need to keep the laws and wash my hands?
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.360]   "Maybe I shouldn't touch that stuff.
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.360]   "Oh my gosh, can I fellowship with those people?
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:14.360]   "All they have is these rules and policies."
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.360]   And Apostle Paul is sitting there like,
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.360]   "Are you crazy?
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.360]   "Why are you looking to these rules, policies,
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.360]   "other people in your community
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:26.360]   "to make you feel like you're secure in Christ?
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.360]   "You have sonship."
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:30.360]   Amen?
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.360]   Heavenly Father, I pray that we would have conviction
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:41.360]   that Lord, if you call us your son,
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.360]   if you call us your daughter,
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.360]   Lord, that is the only way we can be saved.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.360]   Lord, that is the greatest treasure.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:54.360]   Beyond houses, cars, clothing,
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.360]   God, there is no blessing like having somebody
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.360]   who is of perfect love, perfect consistency,
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:07.360]   perfect grace, perfect strength, perfect holiness,
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:10.360]   to love us as a Heavenly Father.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.360]   And so I pray, God, that our hearts are encouraged,
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.360]   and Lord, that that would produce in us
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:19.360]   a fruit of strength, a fruit of stability,
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:22.360]   that no matter what criticisms, pressures,
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.360]   even just hardships that come,
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.360]   God, that they weigh nothing to us because of you.
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.360]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name.
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.360]   Amen.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.360]   Okay, before we get into announcements
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.360]   and discussion questions, I did say,
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:40.360]   today, in some sense, the passage was pretty simple
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.360]   because it, again, encapsulated gospel message
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.360]   and gospel truth.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.360]   But I do have a question here,
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.360]   and I want to answer it.
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:55.360]   Oh, sorry.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:00.360]   As you guys, I've got two questions for,
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.360]   was there a Bible Lab?
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.360]   There was, it ended last Sunday.
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.360]   But we will offer it again at the beginning of,
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.360]   we typically do it once a quarter
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:10.360]   or at least, bare minimum,
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:12.360]   beginning of the next session too, okay?
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.360]   All right.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.360]   And then,
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.360]   okay.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.360]   All right, so for today,
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:25.360]   any other questions that you guys have for the passage?
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.360]   I think this was a pretty straightforward passage, etc.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:30.360]   Okay.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.360]   Then, by way of discussion questions,
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.360]   here, actually, I was going to move this to the end.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:40.360]   Pastor Peter Chung just has some announcements for us,
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.360]   given our kind of busy schedule this month.
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.360]   And then we'll post the discussion questions up
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.360]   so you guys can discuss.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:50.360]   Okay.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.360]   Do you want to just?
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.360]   You can just hold it like that.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.360]   Okay.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:58.360]   Can I get the slide?
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.360]   Well, actually, it's here. Let me push this.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.360]   Okay.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:09.360]   All right, I do have some announcements
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:11.360]   and some housekeeping things.
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.360]   Just to start,
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.360]   we have more people in small group and home group
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:19.360]   this term than last.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.360]   And we're running out of space.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.360]   So I've asked the small group leaders,
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:28.360]   if your attendance or your preparation is shoddy,
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.360]   let me know.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:33.360]   And then drop them and put them in my table.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.360]   And then hear me introduce myself
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.360]   week after week after week after week after week
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.360]   after week after week, okay?
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.360]   So this is something that is part of the membership covenant.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.360]   But this is also a privilege
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.360]   to walk with brothers and sisters
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:50.360]   for the course of a term.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.360]   So if you don't take it seriously,
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:59.360]   there are people that are waiting for that spot.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.360]   So my encouragement is come prepared.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.360]   Okay, remember the idea is you're coming to share
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.360]   rather than coming to learn.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.360]   If you're not comfortable with learning,
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.360]   we want you to learn how to do it on your own, okay?
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:14.360]   So the announcements,
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:18.360]   so February 17th,
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.360]   for all the men in this room,
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.360]   we have a men's workshop.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.360]   The speaker is a dear friend of our church.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.360]   I mean, he actually took one of our girls.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.360]   He married her, okay?
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.360]   But he's a dear friend.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.360]   And he's gonna be speaking on
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:38.360]   just the holiness that is required of the men of God, okay?
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.360]   And a lot of you guys procrastinate
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:45.360]   and are not faithful stewards of your time, all right?
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:47.360]   So if you guys can,
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.360]   sign up ahead of time and pay ahead of time
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:52.360]   because a lot of times, like, the line goes out the door
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:54.360]   because people are still paying there.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.360]   Refreshments will be served.
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.360]   We're gonna have a workshop.
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.360]   We're gonna have a discussion.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.360]   And then we're gonna have a time of lunch.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.360]   And we're gonna cater from Panda Express, okay?
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:06.360]   We're gonna have orange chicken and broccoli,
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.360]   beef, coming at your nose, all right?
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:13.360]   So please take a moment to do this right now if you can, okay?
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.360]   Don't wait till the last minute, all right?
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:18.360]   'Cause logistically, if you've ever done logistics,
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:22.360]   people signing up at the end, it's always hard, okay?
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.360]   So just in consideration of the people putting this together,
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:27.360]   please sign up earlier than later.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360]   Next slide, please.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:33.360]   Is that it?
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.360]   So March 9th, we're gonna have,
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:39.360]   we're gonna try to do this either, like, three times a week,
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:43.360]   sorry, three times a year or four.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:47.360]   There's a lot of, like, wear and tear in our church,
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.360]   a lot of things that need to be regularly cleaned
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.360]   that a rotating cleaning crew can't get to.
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.360]   So we're gonna have our first one of the year on March 9th,
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.360]   and we're gonna try to make sure the sanctuary is spotless,
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:01.360]   and we're gonna try to organize the church a little bit.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.360]   So if you guys can come that day,
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:10.360]   please join us and help beautify our campus, okay?
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.360]   Next slide.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.360]   So here's a couple very important announcements.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:21.360]   We've been told that there are either just homeless people
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:26.360]   or just strange people at night in the,
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:29.360]   just in these facilities.
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:34.360]   And the last thing I want is to have one of our sisters
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:38.360]   having to walk far away and get freaked out, okay?
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:43.360]   So if you are a brother and you parked either in this lot
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:45.360]   or, I mean, just on our campus,
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:47.360]   if you guys can park farther away
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.360]   and then allow our sisters to park close by,
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:53.360]   that would be greatly appreciated.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:56.360]   Ladies, is that appreciatable?
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.360]   Yes, okay?
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:02.360]   So brothers, if I see you parking here,
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:05.360]   I'm gonna give you the persecution eyes of death, okay?
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.360]   So please don't park, and if you're gonna come early,
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:13.360]   you can't park in those lots until I think after 5 o'clock.
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.360]   But if you guys can, park farther away, get your steps in,
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.360]   and for safety reasons, leave the closer ones for the sisters.
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:25.360]   We're not allowed to park in this lot, that's right here,
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.360]   right beyond the fence.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:29.360]   And that's only for Sundays only,
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:31.360]   so you can't park there on the Wednesday.
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:36.360]   But please, there are people that are a little bit unnerving
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.360]   that are wandering around.
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.360]   So please do, just for the sake of the sisters.
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.360]   And the last thing is, the BAM winter retreat,
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.360]   this is just more of a prayer request.
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:47.360]   Please keep that in prayer, 'cause that's,
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:50.360]   this weekend we have the college students
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:53.360]   and then the youth group, they're all going on a retreat,
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.360]   and then the BAM, we've got it two weeks later.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.360]   So please keep that in prayer as well, all right?
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:01.360]   Thank you, that's enough, that's all the announcements.
