[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.640]   We'll take a moment to pray and get started with Bible study.

[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.920]   Heavenly Father, we lift up to you a word of prayer.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.080]   With our hearts gathered, Lord, we want to thank you so much.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.600]   Thank you, God, for the many blessings and privileges
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.360]   we have, particularly, God, to continue to seek you
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.840]   and your will from your word.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.000]   I pray, Father God, that as we join together,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.160]   both in the study and the discussion and more,
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.760]   we pray that this is a time of true edification
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.760]   for our minds to be renewed, for us, Father,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.680]   to grow in every measure, every statute, Lord,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.400]   that you give to us.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.360]   And I pray, Lord, knowing that we cannot bear fruit
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.040]   in of our own flesh.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.440]   And so we ask for your spirit to continue to do a work.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.400]   We ask, Father God, for your guidance
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.800]   and for you to continue to lead our lives.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.280]   And now, Lord, as we again join our voices to lift you up,
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   we desire, Father God, that you be praised.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.760]   In Christ's name, amen.

[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   I just have a couple quick announcements.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   The first, because we have a lot of our BAM single members
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   here on Wednesday Bible study,
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   reminder that this Saturday, our main event of picnic day,
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.960]   which is basically the sports day,
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   is gonna start at 10.30, okay?
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   So please come on time, and it's gonna run 'til 2.30 p.m.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   If you guys recall, like, games, amazing games
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   we brought back, such as Tug of War, Chicken Fight,
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   et cetera, et cetera, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   Please make sure you're there.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   The second thing is we have now hit the past halfway mark
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   of our Bible study series here in Second Peter,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.960]   and, you know, thank you all for volunteering
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.960]   to help out with the various needs that we have
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   for this Bible study, including the parking,
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   the babysitting, and the 6.30-ish setup time.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.960]   We do now need more volunteers
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.960]   for the latter half of the study,
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.960]   so we're gonna resend just to everybody the sign-up sheet.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   If you've already volunteered, thank you,
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   but if you haven't had a chance yet to sign up,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.960]   please go ahead and do so
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   for the remaining half of the Bible study series, okay?
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   All right, at this time, please go ahead
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   and enter into your discussion time,

[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:56.960]   Okay, is this loud enough?
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   Can you guys in the back hear me?
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.960]   Yes? Okay, finally it's fine.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   Sang, you're okay? You can hear?
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.960]   Sang, can you hear?
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   Sang, are you here?
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.960]   Can you hear me, Sang?
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.960]   I only know one Sang, Sang.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.960]   You can hear? Okay.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.960]   Alright, I hope you guys
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   got a good idea of what we're doing.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.960]   Alright, I hope you guys
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.960]   had a good discussion.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.960]   This is a text that, let me see.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.960]   Yeah, so this is a text that
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.960]   you have to kind of have some
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.960]   idea as to what your theological
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.960]   position is because depending on what your theological
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.960]   position is, you're going to end up interpreting this
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.960]   passage very differently.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   So obviously, you don't want to come to a
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.960]   conclusion of your theological position based on prejudice.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   Right? It's like, "Oh, that sounds more fair." It doesn't
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.960]   sound fair. You have to accumulate inductive
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.960]   Bible study and know the passages and then
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.960]   you'll have a leaning and based on that leaning, you're going to
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.960]   see passages differently. Right? So this
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.960]   is one of those passages that if you came in with a certain
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   set of theological position, like they say,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.960]   maybe you came from an Armenian church, if you know
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.960]   what that is, where you were taught that you can lose
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   your salvation, then you're going to look at this as a
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.960]   proof text. You're going to look at this and say, "Well, here's
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.960]   another evidence of that." Right?
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.960]   That is obviously not our position. We are a
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.960]   Reformed church as far as soteriology is concerned
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.960]   but we don't want you to be Reformed just because
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.960]   you happen to be a Reformed church. We want you to make sure that
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.960]   it's coming from careful analysis of the study.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.960]   So what I'm going to do today, I'm going to spend a lot of time
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   looking at cross-references today.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.960]   Cross-references, other passages that speak on the same subject
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.960]   and then have a leaning and then go back
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.960]   and look at the text with that perspective. So before I
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.960]   go in and tell you, "This is the perspective that we're going to be
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.960]   looking at," I'm going to, again, spend more time in the cross-reference
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   and then go back and skim over this text.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   So if you look at it on the surface, it says, "After they have
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.960]   escaped," right? "The defilement of the world."
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.960]   Right? Is that a Christian or not a Christian?
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   How do they do that? By the knowledge of the Lord
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   and Savior Jesus Christ. So in
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   some sense you can look at that and say, "Well, that sounds like a Christian."
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.960]   Right? It would have been
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.960]   better for them not to have known the way
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.960]   of righteousness than have known it to turn away
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.960]   from the holy commandments handed down to them. It has happened
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.960]   to them according to the true proverb, "A dog returns to his own vomit
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.960]   and his soul after washing returns to the wallowing
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.960]   in the mire." So the primary question
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   is, "Is this referring to a Christian who
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.960]   backslides, who loses his salvation?"
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.960]   Right? If it doesn't mean that, how do you interpret
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.960]   this?
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.960]   Right? Why does he explain somebody who's not a Christian
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   in this way? Okay?
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.960]   So here's some cross-references that we're going to be
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.960]   looking at that clearly teaches
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   that salvation cannot be lost.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.960]   Because we didn't earn salvation, so you can't
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.960]   lose salvation. Salvation was given to us.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.960]   Right? So the only way we can lose our salvation is if He takes it from us.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   In John 10, 28, 29, it says, "And I give
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.960]   eternal life." Right? "I give eternal life." Right?
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.960]   We didn't earn it. "They will never perish.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   And no one will snatch them
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.960]   out of My hand.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.960]   My Father who has given them to Me is greater
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   than all." Right?
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.960]   "And no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand." So our salvation
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.960]   is in God, the Father's hands, so
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.960]   there's nothing that can happen, can snatch it out.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.960]   So He gave it to us and He's holding onto us.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   Right? Okay? Romans 8, 29-30,
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   "For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined."
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.960]   Foreknew basically means that He knew us. Not that He was
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   predicting, like He was a fortune teller looking down in history
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.960]   and saying, "Oh, I can see what you're going to do."
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   That's not the doctrine of foreknowledge. Foreknowledge basically means
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.960]   He personally knew us. Right?
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.960]   So those whom He has chosen to love,
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   He predestined to become conformed to the
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   image of His Son. Right? So in other words,
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.960]   if you're saved, God has predestined
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.960]   that we would be sanctified so that He would be the firstborn among many
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.960]   brethren and these whom He predestined, He also
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.960]   called, and those who He called, He
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   justified, and those whom He justified, He also glorified.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.960]   You notice here in every part of the salvation,
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   who's the agent that's working?
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.960]   God is, right? Right? He doesn't say,
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.960]   "He does His part, you do your part, and as long as you do your
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.960]   part, you're fine." He says, "No, He
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   foreknew, predestined, and then those
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.960]   He predestined, He called, right?
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.960]   And that's the reason why you heard the gospel and you believed is because He
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   called, and those He called, He justified, right?
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   The reason why you repented is because He regenerated
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   and He justified you, and those He justified, He glorified.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   Meaning, He will make it to the end.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   Right? 1 Peter 1.5, "Those who are
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   protected by the power of God through faith
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.960]   for salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time." So again,
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.960]   preserved by the Father. Philippians 1.6, Paul
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   says, "I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   in you were perfected until the day of Christ Jesus."
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   So all of the text that you're looking at here
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.960]   is reference to God the Father,
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.960]   right? God the Father has you in His hands,
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.960]   He's the one who initiated, He's the one who caused you to persevere,
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.960]   He's the one who's going to cause you to be glorified. All of it,
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.960]   from the beginning to the end. Right?
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   Hebrews 7.25
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.960]   says, "Therefore He is able," He's talking about Christ,
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   "He is able to save forever." Right?
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.960]   Not until you do your part, but
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.960]   He said, "Those who He has predestined,
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.960]   elected, save forever those who draw near to God
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for us."
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   Right? So He doesn't just intercede
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.960]   at moments, but He said constantly.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.960]   John 6.39, "This is the will of Him who sent me
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.960]   that of all that He has given
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   me, I lose nothing, but raise it
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   up on the last day." Right? Does that
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.960]   sound like that you could lose your salvation?
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.960]   He said, "If God gave Him to me," He says, "I lose none of it."
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.960]   But if we lose our salvation, this wouldn't be true.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.960]   Right?
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.960]   Look at the text. I want you to confirm
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.960]   that the text is clear, that something
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.960]   that God gives to us, He's the one who causes us to persevere,
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.960]   and He's the one who causes us to be glorified. So can somebody
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.960]   who is genuinely saved lose their salvation?
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.960]   According to this text. Right?
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.960]   No.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.960]   No. Okay, I wanted to hear somebody say, "No." Okay.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.960]   No is the answer. Right? Clearly.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   Ephesians 1.13-14, "In Him you also, after
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation, having
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.960]   also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.960]   of promise, who has given as a pledge
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.960]   of our inheritance with a view to the redemption of
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.960]   God's own possession to the praise of His glory." So when
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.960]   you believed, the Holy Spirit was
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.960]   deposited as a pledge, as a deposit.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.960]   Right? So if you lose your salvation, what it means is that the deposit
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.960]   was nullified. That's what that means.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.960]   If you had the Holy Spirit, because of your sins
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.960]   and you didn't persevere, the Holy Spirit was withdrawn from you
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.960]   and you no longer have the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit basically failed.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.960]   Jesus failed and God failed. That's
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.960]   basically what that means. Right?
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.960]   So the text where it says God
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.960]   is sovereign, that our salvation is
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.960]   completely in His hand, that we cannot lose our salvation
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.960]   is clear. There's many passages that teach that.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.960]   But the reason why there's a tension is because
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.960]   we have passages like these.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.960]   Matthew 10.22, "You will be hated by all
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.960]   because of my name, but it is the one who has endured to the
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.960]   end will be saved."
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.960]   Right? It says you have to
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   endure to be saved.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.960]   The one who makes it to the end. 1 Corinthians 15.2,
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.960]   "By which also you are saved if you hold fast."
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.960]   If you hold fast, meaning continue, persevere
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   with the word which I preach to you unless you believed in
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.960]   vain. Right?
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.960]   Meaning you professively, but you believed in vain because you didn't
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.960]   hold fast to the end. You didn't persevere to the end.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.960]   Okay? Are you guys following?
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.960]   Okay. 2 Timothy 2.11-13,
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   "It is a trustworthy statement for if we died with Him,
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.960]   we will also live with Him. If we endure,
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.960]   we will also reign with Him." Right? If we
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.960]   endure, we will reign with Him. If we deny
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.960]   Him, He also will deny us.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.960]   Right? "If we are faithless, He
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   remains faithful for He cannot deny Himself." God remains
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.960]   faithful to all His promises. But if you say you believe
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.960]   and you deny Him, He said He will deny us.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.960]   Right? That's what it says.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.960]   So does this mean that you can lose your salvation?
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.960]   That you profess one time and then later on you deny Him?
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:41.960]   That means you lost your salvation. What does that mean?
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.960]   Every single one of these things says perseverance is necessary.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   You have to hold fast to the end. Those who do not deny
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.960]   and go get to the end. Hebrews 10.26-27,
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.960]   "For if we go on sinning,
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.960]   willfully, after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a terrifying
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.960]   expectation of judgment and fury." Right? To profess, but then you
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.960]   continue in sin. Okay? So let's look at these
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.960]   texts that we just looked at. The first set of
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.960]   texts that we looked at, God the Father, clearly
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.960]   He's the one who initiated. He's the one who causes us to persevere.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   He promises that He will hold on to us. Jesus Himself
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.960]   says, right? He says, "Everyone that
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   God has given to me, I will not lose.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.960]   I will keep to the end." Scripture says
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.960]   in Ephesians that if you are saved, the Holy Spirit
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.960]   has been deposited in you, guaranteeing.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.960]   Right? Guaranteeing your salvation. So those
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.960]   passages clearly says that you cannot lose your
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.960]   salvation. You cannot lose something that you did not earn.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.960]   It was given to you as a free gift. Right? You didn't
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.960]   earn it, so you cannot lose it.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.960]   Clearly. But these texts say that you must
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.960]   persevere. Right? So how do we
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.960]   reconcile these verses? And I've only highlighted
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.960]   a few of these. Right? You cannot
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.960]   choose a doctrinal statement that
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:05.960]   holds on to one and ignores the other.
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.960]   You cannot look at both sections and say,
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.960]   "You know what? I like this better. This makes more sense
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.960]   to me. I don't know what to do with the other verses where it
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.960]   says you cannot lose your salvation." Right?
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.960]   Or you can't come and say, "I don't believe we can lose our
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.960]   salvation, but I don't know what to do with these verses."
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.960]   So how do you explain these verses where it says you have
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.960]   to persevere to the end? Right?
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.960]   So you cannot declare the sovereignty of God and
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.960]   then say, "I don't have answers for this and you do not deal
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.960]   with it." Whatever doctrinal position you take, you have to reconcile
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.960]   both. Right? Or else it's not a doctrinal
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:44.960]   position. It's just your preference. Right?
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   So how do we reconcile this position?
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   Okay. Now I'm not going to go
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   through this. Don't worry. Okay? So if
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.960]   I think our youth group, if
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.960]   you were here for transformation, they put up tulip. Tulip is
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.960]   basically total depravity. Right? Meaning we don't have
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.960]   it doesn't mean that you're depraved as
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.960]   bad as you can get. It just means that we do not have the ability
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.960]   to choose. Right? That's what
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:14.960]   doctrinal total depravity. Unconditional election is God
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   chooses us not based upon a condition.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.960]   Right? If you do this, I will choose you. It says no.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.960]   It's unconditional election. Free grace. Right?
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.960]   Grace that is free. Right? Free grace
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   has a different doctrinal thing that I don't want you to get
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.960]   confused with. Okay? Limited atonement. Because
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.960]   God has elected us unconditionally and
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.960]   we do not have the ability to choose him.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.960]   Limited atonement basically means when he was crucified on the cross
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.960]   he absorbed the sins of the elect.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.960]   Specifically the elect. Right? That's why it's called limited
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.960]   atonement. Right? And the irresistible grace is when
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   God chooses us, you cannot resist. The reason
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.960]   why you responded, the reason why you believed is because
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   God was already working to bring you to him.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.960]   Right? Those whom he predestined, he called
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.960]   those he called. Right? He
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.960]   justified and those he justified he glorified.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.960]   And then the last part of his perseverance of the saints
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.960]   is if these things are true
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   the evidence of these things is that you
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   will persevere. Right?
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.960]   So how do we reconcile these two seemingly
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.960]   contradictory verses? Right?
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   God is sovereign and
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.960]   the proof of election is perseverance.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:35.960]   Right?
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.960]   So the biblical doctrine does not give room
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   for a Christian who is in rebellion against God.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.960]   There are people in our generation who believe
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   that because they, God saved us, one saved
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.960]   always saved, that even if you live in sin
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.960]   that you can have assurance of salvation because
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.960]   one saved always saved. Clearly I was saved at one
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.960]   point even though I'm not walking right with God. It doesn't
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.960]   matter because I cannot lose my salvation. So they're holding on to
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   one part. But the second part clearly says if you
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   do not persevere, right, you will not be saved.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.960]   Those who hold fast to the word of God, those who make it to the end
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   without denying Christ. Right? So the
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.960]   doctrine of perseverance of the saints is
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.960]   those who have been elect of God, who has
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   salvation will persevere.
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.960]   Does that make sense?
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.960]   And so that's how those two sections are reconciled
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.960]   without compromise. So there is no position
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.960]   where a Christian who is willfully sinning can say
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.960]   I am for sure saved because that contradicts
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.960]   the second part of the passage verses that we looked at.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.960]   Right? And there's no Christian who can say
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.960]   you know I'm saved today and then I'm not saved tomorrow because
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.960]   yesterday I did something or tomorrow I did something bad and then I
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.960]   come back today you're being saved, not saved, being saved.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.960]   So how many times in your life are you saved and not saved, saved and not saved?
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.960]   Right? There is no position that
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.960]   allows that to happen. Right? Our salvation is secure
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   but the security of our salvation is proven by our life.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   Right? Not simply because we are working
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.960]   harder but because the transformed person
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.960]   would not be able to go back to their old life.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:17.960]   Right? If I
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.960]   as an example
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.960]   if I ate something that I thought was delicious
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   and then I found out that it was
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.960]   dog poop. Right?
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.960]   I ate it for 10 years or 15 years and
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   somebody turned on the light it just tasted really good. Somebody
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   put sugar on it. Whatever. Right? I apologize
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.960]   for this illustration. Okay?
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.960]   But that's the only thing I can think of. So hopefully it will stick.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.960]   Okay. All of a sudden you find out
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.960]   it's dog poop. Once
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.960]   you're enlightened with that dog poop
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.960]   all the memory of the good
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.960]   taste is gonna be washed
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.960]   away from "mmm" to "ugh"
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.960]   because of that knowledge. Because your
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.960]   eyes got opened and you will never
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.960]   be able to eat that again. Right? Every once in a
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.960]   while you will forget. You will remember what it was
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.960]   like the 10 years you were eating it and you got hungry and you got tempted
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.960]   but as soon as you remember it's dog poop
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.960]   you're not gonna be able to go back. Right?
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.960]   So it's not just talking about pure
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.960]   effort. It's talking about you're not able to
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.960]   because God transformed your inner being
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   now you're no longer creatures of darkness. You're creatures of light.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.960]   So once your eyes have been opened to see
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.960]   what it is that you have been tempted
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.960]   in the past, you may be tempted by it
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:47.960]   but you can never go back. Right?
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.960]   Not you shouldn't go back, you can't go back.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   Because that new
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.960]   revelation now completely has changed your view
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.960]   of everything. Okay? So that's the doctrine of
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.960]   perseverance of the saints. If God has truly elected you
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   you've been truly transformed, right? You will
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   persevere. So here's some passage. Here's a passage
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.960]   if 2 Peter 2 20-22 is
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:14.960]   difficult, this passage is much more.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.960]   Right? This is the go-to text for people who
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.960]   like here's the proof that you can lose your
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.960]   salvation. But look at this text.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.960]   In case of those who once have been enlightened, right?
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   You think what it says in 2 Peter 2 20 is
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.960]   seems to be confusing but this one's actually been enlightened
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.960]   tasted the heavenly gift. I want you to look at
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:38.960]   how he used the word tasted. Right?
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.960]   Not eaten and digested but tasted.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.960]   Have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, tasted
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.960]   the good word of God and the powers of the age to come
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.960]   and then have fallen away. Right?
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   So a lot of people have a problem because they look at this
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.960]   and say how can that not be a Christian?
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.960]   Right? Once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.960]   and partakers of the Holy Spirit. I mean it seems like this person
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.960]   has everything that you need to be a Christian.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.960]   Right? But here's the problem. He says it is impossible
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.960]   to renew them to again to repentance.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.960]   So if this is a Christian who is
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.960]   backsliding, if you backslide you can
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.960]   never repent?
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   God will never accept the second repentance?
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   Only the first one? Is that what this means?
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.960]   How many of you would be Christians to this day?
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.960]   If this is the case? How many of you
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   can have assurance today? Is there any of you who have never
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   repented after you became a Christian? But if you believe
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   that this is a Christian who falls and he says
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.960]   he can never repent again, that's a bigger problem.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   Right? Which none of us would be here if this is the case.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.960]   Since they again crucified themselves the Son of
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.960]   put him open to shame. So
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.960]   who is he referring to if this can't be a Christian?
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.960]   Right? Look what he says. I think 7 and 8 clarifies that.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.960]   "For a ground that drinks the rain,
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.960]   which often brings forth the vegetation
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.960]   useful for those whose sake the till receives a blessing
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.960]   from God. Right? But if it yields
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.960]   thorns and thistles it is worthless and close to being cursed
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.960]   and it ends up being burned."
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.960]   I think this explains what he means here.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.960]   "Drinks the rain" is in reference to this.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.960]   Right?
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.960]   These are people who are in the church
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.960]   in every way they look like Christians.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.960]   They experience Bible study. They hear the Word of God.
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.960]   Right? They receive the blessing of being
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.960]   in a community that has the Holy Spirit.
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.960]   Where the teaching, the Word of God, prayer meetings are happening, mission work
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.960]   is happening, there's leadership, there's the elders
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.960]   and leaders who are leading you.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.960]   He says they are drinking the rain. Right?
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.960]   But the ones who are elect, what happens?
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.960]   They're useful. They bring forth vegetation.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.960]   Same people, the rain is coming
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:05.960]   but it yields thorns and thistles.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.960]   Does that make sense? Right?
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.960]   So this is not in reference to Christians who are losing salvation
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.960]   but these are people who look like Christians who are inside the church.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.960]   Right?
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.960]   And here's another passage that explains that.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   "They went out from us but they were not really of us.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.960]   For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us."
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.960]   Right? In other words, persevered.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.960]   "If they were of the elect, but they went out
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:35.960]   so that it would be shown that they are all not of us."
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.960]   Right?
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   So that's clear reference to the proof
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.960]   that they are elect and that they are in God's hands
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:47.960]   that they would remain, they would persevere.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.960]   But the fact that they don't persevere is evidence that they were never of us
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.960]   to begin with. They were just going through the motion.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.960]   Their eyes were never really opened.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.960]   So then why would people like that be at church?
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.960]   Why would people who were just kind of going through the motion
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.960]   but never had their eyes really opened
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:08.960]   never really knew the goodness of God,
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:11.960]   never really saved, why would they be so busy at church?
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.960]   Okay.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.960]   You can talk about that in your small group.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.960]   Okay?
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.960]   Especially in a post-Christian culture like ours,
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:26.960]   what benefit is there in being in church?
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:29.960]   Friendship?
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.960]   Community?
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.960]   Purpose? Morality?
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.960]   Right? There's a lot of benefits.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.960]   Football, softball, basketball, right?
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.960]   Trunk formation, just all kinds of stuff.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.960]   Raise your children together, right? Friendship.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:52.960]   So I mean, there's all kinds of reasons why people would go through the motion to stay.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.960]   But then if genuine faith is not there,
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:58.960]   as soon as you give them a--you break that.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.960]   Right? As soon as you have relational problems.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.960]   As soon as those reasons why church is important to you is no longer there,
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:11.960]   then you have no reason to persevere because that's the reason why you were there.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.960]   Right?
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.960]   The only reason why a Christian would persevere through difficulty
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.960]   is because you're here for truth. Right?
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.960]   We're here to worship God, and friendship and community
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.960]   and all this other stuff happens as a result of that.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.960]   But if that's the reason you're here, that's all that needs to break.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   Disappointment with people, and that's all in need, and then you're gone.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.960]   Okay? So the text that we're looking at here is the same thing.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:41.960]   It's talking about people who are in the church in every way look like Christians.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.960]   Right? They escaped the defilement of the world.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.960]   How did they escape the defilement of the world? They're inside the church.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.960]   Right? They're part of the community.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.960]   They're not a part of a group of people who are going out, you know, sinning.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   By the knowledge of the Lord.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.960]   So again, because of the gospel, the community is formed.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   And again, you notice here, entangled. Entangled means wove together.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   It's not just somebody who's just kind of tripping up.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:11.960]   That this word basically is like you're intertwined with the world.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   And then overcome. Right?
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.960]   So he's not talking about somebody who's struggling with temptation.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   He's talking about somebody who's entangled and overcome.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.960]   Right? Completely saturated with the world.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.960]   He said the last state has become worse than the first.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:30.960]   Right? Why would the last state be worse than the first?
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.960]   What is the difference between the first and then the second?
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   Second is much more willful.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:48.960]   Right? Where prior you were doing because that's all you knew.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:53.960]   But when you have been in the church, been exposed to the gospel, have all the benefits.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:58.960]   Right? And then you fall. You're willfully going that direction.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.960]   Right? So it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:06.960]   than have known it to turn away from the Holy Commandments, hand it on to them.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.960]   It has happened to them according to the true Proverbs.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.960]   Coming from Proverbs, a dog returned to his own vomit.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.960]   A sow after washing returns to its own mire. That sounds like poop to me.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   Right? The illustration seems like, you know, which is worse, the dog eating the vomit?
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.960]   They're about the same. Right?
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:28.960]   Returning back to poop. You used to eat poop and you say, "Oh, disgusting."
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.960]   And then after a while you go back. That's how he describes it.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:37.960]   And the dog and a sow, a pig, are considered unclean animals to Jews.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.960]   So he's choosing something that they would say.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.960]   We would say, "Ew" to poo and they would say, "Ew" to dog.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.960]   Right? It's not like pets, like we have pets.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.960]   Like, "Oh, cute." Right?
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:53.960]   It's like dog and pig would elicit the same response that we would get when I say poop.
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:59.960]   Right? And so basically he's using something disgusting and saying it's like those animals.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:04.960]   Like we're no better than those animals when we recognize what's filthy.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:08.960]   Or at least profess to recognize what's filthy and then going back to its vomit. Right?
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:14.960]   So he says it's better for them to have never known. Right?
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.960]   Because now you know and based upon the knowledge that you've been given,
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.960]   he says you will be judged and the scripture is clear on that.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.960]   He says, "And you, Capernaum." Remember the three cities?
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.960]   Remember when we were going through the Gospel of Matthew, some of you guys were there?
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:34.960]   There are three cities where Jesus spent the majority of his time doing miracles.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   It's considered, they call it the evangelical trinity or triangle.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:49.960]   Capernaum, Bethsaida, what's the other one?
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:53.960]   Chorazin. Right?
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:58.960]   So those are the three cities. It's right above, if this is Galilee, this is Jerusalem.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.960]   Do you see it? Picture Galilee, Jerusalem,
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:08.960]   Samaria, somewhere down here. And those three cities are up here.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.960]   Right? So Jesus spent the majority of his ministry in those three cities.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.960]   So most of the miracles you see Jesus performing is in one of those cities.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.960]   So Jesus is saying, "And Capernaum will not be exalted in heaven, will you?
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:24.960]   You will descend to Hades, for if the miracles had occurred to Sodom,
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:29.960]   which is considered an evil city, which had occurred in you, it would have remained to this day."
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.960]   In other words, they would have repented if they received everything that you received.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.960]   So if you remember, Jesus spends most of his ministry doing miracles,
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:42.960]   and then the highlight of his ministry happens in John chapter 6,
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:48.960]   when he feeds the 5,000. And then remember what happens after he feeds the 5,000?
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:54.960]   John 6, 66. They no longer walk with him
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.960]   because it was too difficult to accept what he was saying.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.960]   Because prior to this, he says, "I am the bread. You're looking for me because you had bread,
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.960]   but I am the bread." Right? "If you do not eat of my flesh and drink of my blood,
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.960]   I have no relationship with you." And as a result of that, they turned away.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.960]   Jesus said, "You're not coming after me because you want me.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.960]   You're coming after me because of the bread." Right? He said, "I am the bread."
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.960]   And so they couldn't accept that, so they turned.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.960]   So in other words, all those professing followers of Jesus rejected Jesus
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.960]   because Jesus would not give them what they wanted.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.960]   That was not the Messiah they wanted. They wanted the king.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:35.960]   They wanted a miracle worker. They wanted a social worker,
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.960]   but not a savior for their sins. Right?
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.960]   So that's what he's saying. He said, "You've been given blessing upon blessing.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.960]   The Son of God walked among you. You've seen people who are blind, eyes open.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.960]   You saw me walking on water, right? And yet you rejected me
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.960]   because I didn't give you what you wanted." Right?
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:59.960]   So there's greater judgment coming upon you. Luke 12, 47, 48.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.960]   "And that slave who knew his master's will and did not get ready
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:07.960]   or act in accordance with his will will receive many lashes,
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.960]   but the one who did not know it and committed deeds worthy of flogging
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:16.960]   will receive but a few." Right? Based upon what? Based upon knowledge. Right?
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.960]   "From everyone who has been given much, much will be required,
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:26.960]   and to whom they entrusted much of him they will ask all the more." Okay?
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.960]   So what is the application of this?
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:38.960]   A nonbeliever in the church is much more in a dangerous place
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.960]   than a non-Christian outside the church.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.960]   Let me say that again. A non-Christian inside the church
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.960]   going through the motion is under stricter judgment
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.960]   than the non-Christians who are outside the church. Right?
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.960]   And this is why the seeker-friendly movement is so dangerous
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.960]   because you're inviting non-Christians who refuse to be converted
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.960]   to feel comfortable and accepted in the church. Right?
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.960]   We're not saying that we should condemn them,
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.960]   but a goal of a non-Christian being brought to church
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:20.960]   who doesn't have singular goal is to bring them to Christ. Right?
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:24.960]   And if they don't see any difference between the church and the world,
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:27.960]   why would they need to convert? Right?
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.960]   They found friendship. They found community.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:33.960]   And all they needed to do was to say, "Okay, I'll take Jesus.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.960]   I'll take some of Jesus." Right?
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.960]   And they can function in the church. They can be in the church.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.960]   They can serve in the church. And sometimes they rise up into leadership
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:48.960]   and don't feel any urgency to convert. Right?
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.960]   So I think it's done with good intentions,
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.960]   but the end result is horrific,
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.960]   where you're going to have a lot of people in the church
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:01.960]   who do not understand the gospel feeling perfectly safe
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.960]   until the Judgment Day. Right?
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.960]   So the discussion question for today is,
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.960]   what is the difference between someone who is entangled and overcome by the world
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.960]   versus someone who is struggling with temptation?
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.960]   There is a big difference between somebody who is living in sin
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:22.960]   and somebody who is struggling with sin.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.960]   How do you know the difference? Okay?
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.960]   And before you look and judge other people,
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.960]   how would you know the difference? Right?
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.960]   For yourself.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.960]   With struggling with sin versus living in sin, what's the difference? Right?
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:41.960]   The Bible calls for church discipline for those who are willfully sinning
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960]   and rebelling against God. Right?
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.960]   If you've never seen or participated in church discipline,
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.960]   or if you come from a church where only grace was taught,
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.960]   without exception,
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.960]   even the word "discipline" sounds ungodly.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.960]   Not gracious.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.960]   And yet, the Bible is clear on that. Right?
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.960]   Not only are we to be gracious, we are to be holy,
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.960]   and we are never to compromise either.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.960]   We don't compromise grace because we need to be holy,
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:14.960]   and we don't compromise holiness because we need to be gracious.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:18.960]   So the challenge is, how do we practice this well? Right?
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.960]   Ask any parent.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.960]   That's a constant struggle. Right?
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.960]   Do I discipline him, or do I encourage him? Right?
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:33.960]   And you're constantly wrestling back and forth.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.960]   What happens if I discipline him when he needs encouragement? Right?
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:41.960]   They get discouraged, and it's like, "Oh, nobody loves me,"
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:44.960]   and they go off. And then what happens to a child
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:49.960]   when they are shown mercy and grace when they need discipline? Right?
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:52.960]   Spoiled. Self-centered.
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.960]   The universe revolves around them.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.960]   So there's a constant challenge of, how do we practice discipline
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.960]   and grace and love and patience and holiness all at the same time?
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:06.960]   And it's no different at church. Right?
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.960]   You cannot do one without the other. Both need to be practiced.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.960]   But the challenge is, how do we do it? When do we do it? Right?
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.960]   And so there is no one chart that you go through and say,
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.960]   "Oh, now I get it. This is how you're supposed to do it,"
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:22.960]   because all of it needs judgment. Right?
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:25.960]   And that's why elders and leaders have been given--
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.960]   one of the biggest responsibilities of the elders in the church
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.960]   is to make that judgment. Okay?
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.960]   And the church also, we need to--
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.960]   again, discipline cannot be carried out by just the church leaders.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.960]   The church leaders may have to come to a conclusion,
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.960]   but when we do carry it out, it has to be the church. Okay?
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.960]   So the second is, how do we do that? What principles should we use? Right?
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.960]   Is our tendency to make a mistake to the left or to the right? Right?
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.960]   What is your tendency? Your tendency. Right?
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.960]   Do you tend to be more gracious? Do you tend to be more judgmental? Right?
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.960]   Again, I'm talking about you.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.960]   Don't think about those five people that you need to judge. Okay?
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.960]   How do you determine when to practice patience and grace
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.960]   and when to practice accountability and discipline? Okay, same question.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.960]   Four, what sin or sins do you struggle with that so easily entangles,
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:19.960]   both sins that are observable and the sins that are of the heart? Okay?
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.960]   Read Hebrews 12, 1, and then 4 through 13,
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:25.960]   and see what insights are given in our fight against sin. Okay?
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:29.960]   So if you have time to be able to do that, I encourage you to do that. Okay?
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.960]   So let me pray for us, and then I'll give you time to jump into this.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:41.960]   Heavenly Father, we pray for wisdom.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:46.960]   We pray for sensitivity to your Holy Spirit's guidance.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.960]   Lord, give us the knowledge, give us the wisdom,
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.960]   give us the heart and brokenness and humility to be able to receive your guidance.
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:03.960]   If there is any hurtful ways in us, help us, Lord God, that it may be revealed,
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:06.960]   that we may be humble enough, Lord God, to share.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.960]   Help us, Lord God, to take sin in our lives that we may have compromised
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.960]   or have excused, that you would reveal it to us,
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.960]   that our striving after holiness, Lord God, would not be passive.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.960]   But help us also, Lord God, that we would not be overly harsh.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.960]   Help us to be gracious as you've been gracious to us.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:33.960]   We pray that in our discussion that you would help us to be open, to be vulnerable,
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.960]   and again, that our application would be biblical.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.960]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
