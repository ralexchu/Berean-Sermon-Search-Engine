[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   [END]
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.360]   Upon whom Jesus said I will build my church, right?
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:25.360]   So Paul is saying if we look at the Galatians timeline
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:30.400]   He's only interacted with the Apostles just two times in
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.720]   17 years
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.720]   Is that a lot?
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:41.600]   I mean imagine if you only interacted with someone two times in 17 years
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:47.400]   You wouldn't necessarily feel like Oh kindred spirit like that's that's my buddy. That's just this it's very infrequent
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.080]   okay, and
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.760]   the point of all of this is I
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.880]   received
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.880]   The gospel that I'm preaching
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:04.040]   Everywhere and especially I preach to you guys. This was a direct
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.240]   revelation of
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.160]   Jesus Christ
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160]   direct revelation
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.680]   Of Jesus Christ, so that's the point. Okay, and
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.360]   so today
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.400]   this little parenthetical phrase
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.480]   Now in what I am writing to you
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:29.000]   I assure you before God that I am NOT lying in my mind as I mull over this passage
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.600]   That's actually the most important verse
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.840]   Because he's saying
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.880]   This is a gospel from God
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.760]   Directly given to me and I swear to God. I'm not lying
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.800]   now
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.480]   How many people?
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:55.040]   How many liars in the history of mankind do you think have ever sworn? I am NOT lying. I swear to God. I'm not lying
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:03.320]   100% of every liar that's ever existed has probably said I promise you I'm not lying. Okay, so Paul is saying this
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:07.840]   Okay. So what I want to do is if
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.560]   Someone like Paul is saying I have a direct message from God
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:20.320]   From Old Testament history all the way to now there has been a way you verify those things
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.120]   so how does a
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.760]   person how do Christians look at Paul saying I promise I'm not lying and actually
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.760]   Find it credible. So we're gonna be looking at a little bit of
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:40.960]   How we can actually trust what Paul is saying, okay, so 2nd Peter 1 20 to 21
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.240]   But know this first of all that not no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:52.240]   For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:58.200]   But men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. That's how we have the Old Testament
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.360]   That's how we know how the New Testament. Amen
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:03.840]   Men were moved by the Holy Spirit to write
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.720]   Perfectly what God intended
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.320]   Okay, Hebrews 1 1 2 2
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:17.360]   God after he spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:25.560]   portions in many ways and these last days have spoken to us in his son
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.600]   Whom he appointed heir of all things
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.820]   Through whom also he made the world now
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.760]   up to the time of Paul
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.680]   They had the Old Testament Scriptures now we have old and new
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.440]   Okay, and I want to do a little bit of a breakdown of the whole Bible
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:48.480]   There are 66 books of the Bible and hopefully you guys knew this
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.320]   How many authors
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.360]   pop quiz
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.640]   It's on there
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   You better get it, right? Okay
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:05.640]   40 plus different writers contributed to the writing of the 66
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.160]   book book
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:15.360]   Okay, and they were not all PhD scholars you have Amos anybody know what Amos did
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:21.520]   He's a shepherd, okay, you have Kings
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.840]   You have
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.280]   Symbol players have you ever heard of a staff?
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.600]   He was a praise leader. You know how a staff led praise
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:40.520]   Symbols you got a praise leader write scripture. What was Apostle Peter's trade?
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:44.340]   Fishermen
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.720]   you had
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:53.480]   All kinds of different people with all kinds of different skills from all walks of life
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:00.920]   Writing this book and that was over a course of 1,500 years
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:07.040]   Three different languages Hebrew Aramaic and Greek and
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:12.200]   The consistent message is God will holy holy. Holy
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:18.480]   God will one day reconcile sinful man to himself through the promised Messiah. That is the
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.800]   uniting theme throughout the whole of scriptures
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   40 different authors over
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:33.440]   1,500 years three languages all saying the exact same thing because they were speaking on behalf of the exact same
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.120]   United God
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.000]   Are you guys following along
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.480]   Paul
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:43.480]   Later, he's gonna write scripture
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:49.680]   He's writing a big chunk of the New Testament, right? So he's an author of the scriptures
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:55.720]   And so when Paul says something like now in what now I assure you in what I am writing
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:00.280]   I assure you before God. I am NOT lying you hope that to be credible and
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.440]   one of the things about
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.480]   revelations
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.800]   through and to people
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:11.600]   If they're from God, this is what we can expect
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.840]   the first thing is
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:22.440]   They're all focused more on the exaltation of the Lamb of God and a lot less on the future of mankind
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:27.520]   Does that make sense
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.560]   If I am receiving a direct revelation from the Lord
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.600]   It's not for like humanities
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.400]   like earthly blessing
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:41.120]   It really is for the exaltation and the supremacy of the Lamb of God
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.280]   Who takes away the sins of the world?
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:50.240]   So that is actually the core element a lot of times with different cults that have popped up over time
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:54.600]   They've actually done away with the Lamb of God or changed him or weakened him
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:59.160]   No, but every genuine prophecy of God that comes through the Holy Spirit
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.080]   exalts Christ and
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.960]   Cares a lot less about man
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.600]   the second if there is a focus on mankind
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:17.400]   It's mankind as primarily an object or recipient of the grace of Holy God
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   We're those whose names are written in the book of the Lamb of God
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.280]   Okay, and it's always confirmed by witnesses
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.600]   So when Paul encountered Jesus
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.360]   Were there people there with him?
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.440]   Yes, and
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.400]   When Paul goes to Galatia, we're gonna look in chapter 2
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:47.400]   It says in chapter 2 verse 2 and I laid out before them the gospel which I preach to the Gentiles
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:53.120]   And I did this in private to the the pillars and they confirmed it
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.600]   okay, it's always confirmed by witnesses and
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:05.440]   All revelations that come to man. It's always going to be consistent. What has always been said of the character of God
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:12.360]   Because Jesus Christ God is the same yesterday and today and forever right? God is not going to change his tune
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:20.920]   So any revelation is gonna stay consistent talking about the character of God exalting the Lamb of God Jesus Christ
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.000]   and
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.560]   That always leaves the recipient
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.040]   Changed and equipped and usually humbled and terrified
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.600]   exalting God
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.600]   and not exalting self and
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:37.420]   with Paul
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:40.080]   This is what happened
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.800]   He did receive the direct revelation of God he exalted the gospel of Christ
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.640]   Everything that he said was confirmed
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:56.520]   It was consistent with what had been been said by all the people that had gone before him and he was left permanently changed
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:00.380]   And equipped for the saving of man equipped for every good work
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:08.440]   Okay, so I want to read Apostle Peter later in chapter 2 Paul
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.340]   Blasts Peter
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:13.780]   right
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:18.860]   That's a pretty like that's actually one of the most like emotionally jarring
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:24.940]   sections of scripture is like this is the Apostle the leader of all the Apostles and
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.140]   Paul says yeah, I
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.060]   Confronted him to his face
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.060]   Okay, but Peter he writes at the end of his letter
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:37.740]   Therefore beloved since you look forward to these things be diligent to be found by him in peace
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:42.340]   spotless and blameless and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:46.020]   Just as also our beloved brother Paul
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.220]   according to the revelation wisdom
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.180]   inspiration given to him wrote to you as
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:58.540]   Also in all his letters speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to understand
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:04.660]   Which the untaught and unstable distort as they do also the rest of the scriptures to their own destruction
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:10.500]   True prophets of God don't distort the scriptures. They stay consistent with it
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:16.020]   Even if it's hard to understand, okay, and Paul writes at the end of his life
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:19.940]   Evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:25.680]   Deceiving and being deceived you however Timothy continuing the things you've learned to become convinced of
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:31.920]   Knowing from whom you learn them and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.880]   That leads to salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus all
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.200]   scripture is
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.200]   inspired by God and
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:46.840]   Profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training and righteousness so that the man of God may be adequate equipped for every good work
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   And I forgot to mention
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.280]   You know who else received a direct revelation from God?
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.500]   on the island of Patmos
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:02.220]   John and all the five things that I listed you could be said of John, right?
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:06.260]   All right, so
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:07.900]   the main point in the
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:13.300]   Autobiography for I would have you know brethren that the gospel which was which was preached by me is not according to man
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:20.620]   For I neither received it from man nor was I taught it but I received it through a revelation of
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:23.100]   Jesus Christ and that's
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:26.140]   That's the main point of the next couple chapters
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:32.040]   So I hopefully answered what makes Paul's direct revelations credible
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:35.180]   Right that was going to be a question. That's kind of lingering
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:43.380]   Did Paul really need no confirmation affirmation from the other apostles? No, he didn't need it and he got it and
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:49.520]   In a few weeks, we're gonna tackle this last one in what ways had Cephas stood condemned
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.520]   And
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.120]   So we're looking at this passage
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:05.000]   And this little section of the scriptures how many guys actually looked at Acts 9
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.160]   Raise your hand higher. How many looked at Acts 9?
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:14.960]   Keep them up if the events and the details of Acts 9
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.120]   Were a little bit difficult to swallow and synchronize with Galatians
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:27.000]   How many you found either one or the other kind of a little bit troubling or unsettling? Hey good
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.120]   All right. I want to so for those you guys who didn't look at it. I just want to quickly read it and
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:39.360]   Give your heart a little bit of peace. Okay, so this is Paul and he took food and was strengthened now for several days
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.400]   he was with the disciples who were at Damascus and
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.400]   Immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogue saying he is a son of God
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.200]   all those hearing him continue to be amazed and
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:55.520]   We're saying is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name and those who had come here for the purpose
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.520]   of bringing them bound before the chief priests
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:04.760]   But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:10.000]   When many days had elapsed the Jews plotted together to do away with him
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:16.320]   But their plot became known to Saul and they were also watching the gates day and night so they may put him to death
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:21.800]   Okay, Paul doesn't mention this in Galatians. Okay that there was like a death death warrant on him
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:25.120]   but his disciples took him by night and
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.480]   Led him down through an opening of the wall lowering him in a large basket
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:32.280]   Is that why he ended up going to?
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.400]   These other places because people were out for his life
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:40.680]   Galatians doesn't say now in verse 26 when Paul came to Jerusalem
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.760]   Wait a minute
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.960]   It seems pretty immediate
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:51.000]   What's this? What's this happening here, right? He was trying to associate with the disciples
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.880]   Okay, doesn't say apostle it says disciples, but they were all afraid of him not believing that he was a disciple
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:03.880]   but Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the Apostles plural and
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:10.360]   Described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road that he had talked to him and how at Damascus
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.960]   he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus and
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.280]   He was with them
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:18.920]   Now I'm wondering if the them is disciples or the Apostles or both, but he's there
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:22.280]   moving about freely in Jerusalem
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:24.760]   Speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:28.520]   This sounds very different than Galatians true or false
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.440]   Okay now
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:36.240]   It's very difficult because we don't have all the details to piece things together
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:43.600]   But I want to just show you something from my own today's my my wife and mine 16th friend-diversary on Facebook
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:52.160]   It showed me that on Facebook. Okay, so I decided okay. I'll use some of stories with me and my wife. All right, so
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:32:01.660]   I've lost some weight since then if you guys can't tell right so 2012. This is what Becky would say
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:04.380]   11 years ago
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:09.740]   We were missionaries living in China and we took a trip to the Philippines
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:15.860]   We visited churches in Cebu and this was our first ever visit
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:20.040]   I've been to the Philippines only once that's Becky
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:24.780]   She didn't really say that I just put words in her electronic mouth. Okay, that's what I did
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:27.460]   And this is me
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.620]   11 years ago
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.620]   We were living in Korea
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:34.540]   and I was working for compassion international and
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:38.260]   This was when I led my first trip to the Philippines
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:44.300]   We visited churches in Ilo Ilo, which is a completely different island. I eat low. It was actually not an island
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:47.060]   It's a completely different city in a different island
[01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:50.840]   And I've been to the Philippines 34 times
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:58.460]   And then I'll say now and what I am saying to you I am NOT lying I
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.660]   Am NOT lying
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:06.060]   Yeah
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.740]   Everything that was written here is true
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:12.680]   in March 2012 Becky and I
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.700]   we
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:18.940]   Were thinking like the Lord is calling us to China, but what are we gonna do in China?
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:23.300]   But I've been a compassion sponsor since 97 and I have a heart for the orphans in China
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:29.620]   Let's go on a vision trip to the Philippines from China join the Korea team and then just explore it
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:37.340]   So we went together on our like five-year anniversary. So we went that was our first trip together. I
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:43.020]   Got hired by compassion a few months later and
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:49.660]   My first trip was December 2012. And if I said December 2012 is 11 years ago
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.660]   Would I be lying or would that actually be?
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:53.500]   Okay to say
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.500]   totally okay to say
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.020]   11 years ago. We were living in Korea
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:01.500]   We were in China
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.860]   We were in Korea and
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:09.620]   I was working for compassion international and we had been missionaries to China and
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:13.100]   This was when I led my first trip to the Philippines
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:18.820]   Wordings a little different now, I'm giving you context and
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:22.420]   On my first trip
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:24.620]   Not ever but as a leader
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:29.260]   We visited churches in Iloilo and I've gone to the Philippines
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:36.820]   34 times I am NOT lying. Both of these are factually true and because I added context you're like, oh
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.700]   Make sense
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.220]   But axe was written by whom?
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:50.100]   Luke and was Luke there at Paul's conversion. No, he was not
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:56.660]   Luke is writing details probably from what he's been told by Paul and just writing stuff
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:34:59.620]   Paul
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:04.260]   In writing Galatians is detailing accurately, but just with a different bent
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:07.260]   Those are not contradictions
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:11.340]   It's just we just don't have access to the context fully
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:15.020]   Not your heads if they're that kind of eases your mind a little bit
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.820]   No, okay. Nobody's at ease. Whatever
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.500]   Wrestle with it. All right
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:23.260]   so
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:28.220]   when we see scripture a lot of times Christians do silly things by trying to
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:34.940]   Force things to make it make perfect sense. That's actually very dangerous
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:39.900]   If we come across passages that are hard to fully reconcile
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.220]   We don't try to answer them away by human logic
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.860]   Just say we don't have access to all the information
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:54.140]   But I trust that all scripture perfectly is God breathed and useful for teaching correction rebuking and training and righteousness
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:55.620]   So that I may be equipped for every good work
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:36:02.020]   Every word that is from the scriptures is as it should be from the mouth of the Lord. I'm just gonna believe it
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:05.420]   Okay, it doesn't mean that we don't tackle these hard
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:10.820]   Not discrepancies, but just like not sync synchronized things
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:16.140]   We don't discount them, but we don't try to twist it to make it make more sense
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:19.100]   Okay, so I'm just gonna leave it at that
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:21.820]   Both of these are perfectly accurate and true
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:24.700]   even though at first glance
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.860]   They seem like they're one of them. They're not the same
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:31.020]   Okay
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:35.380]   Is that helpful at all? Not sure. I need some kind of feedback y'all. I'm a people pleaser
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:39.340]   So I need and we're in Galatians, so I shouldn't say that but you know, whatever
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.300]   So
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:48.140]   This is our passage and I want to just spend my the very bottom here
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:52.140]   But they kept hearing he who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:56.020]   which he once tried to destroy and they were glorifying God because of me and
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:02.220]   the people who are glorifying God because of Paul were probably family members and
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.380]   friends of
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.380]   people Paul killed
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.140]   That's Judea
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:12.100]   That's the heart
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:17.660]   Paul was in Jerusalem putting people in prison dragging away both men and women
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:21.140]   Probably
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:24.820]   Screaming children hanging on to his legs. Please don't do this and
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:31.780]   Those same people who've been robbed of their friends who've been robbed of their parents are
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:36.860]   Glorifying God because of what God did in Paul's life
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:39.860]   That's a that's a that's a
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:44.180]   First of all, that's a lot of forgiveness
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:47.180]   But that's what God does in people's hearts
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:52.500]   He changes people and he changes people through people
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:38:01.140]   And I'm gonna just I touch upon that because I'm gonna ask a follow-up discussion question to that but
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:09.260]   I'm gonna kind of stop here and just talk about some announcements. This is always choppy
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:14.300]   I don't exactly know how to like smoothly but whatever. All right, we have communion Sunday prepare your hearts
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.700]   We are taking the Lord's

[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:03.340]   for Reformation night

[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:19.100]   Candies and little donations. So if you guys have those please do drop them off and then
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:22.060]   Thanksgiving's around the corner believe it or not
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:24.820]   We still need a few host homes
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:27.540]   Okay, so if you have a house
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:30.420]   That you're willing to host
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:35.340]   A dozen to maybe two dozen people in please do sign up for that, but you do have to be a member
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:38.060]   Okay, and then the participation
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:42.620]   Signups are also out. So if you have a moment and you haven't done so
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:48.740]   And you want to participate in the cleaning and maintenance day go ahead and do that now. I'm gonna give you about
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:51.260]   eight nine seconds
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:57.820]   All right, no one touched their phone so I'm gonna go to the next one I
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:01.460]   Don't want to clean that's not my spiritual gift
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:05.580]   Host signups
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:07.980]   This is the QR code for the host signups
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:14.500]   November 19th. Okay, and then we do have like a synchronized worship time
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:21.100]   Like we did last year. So if you can please sign up for this if you are willing to host
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   Okay, nobody touched their phones I will move on
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:34.300]   Okay, so for next week we're looking at chapter 2 verses 1 through 5
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.380]   The questions are for Paul. What would qualify as running in vain?
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:41.980]   and
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.780]   this
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:49.380]   The word he goes I was afraid I was running in vain. That's a little bit of an interpretation
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:55.900]   So when you tackle that is Paul actually doubting something here, or is he like thinking the Apostles are a waste of time?
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:01.180]   So this is going to be an important question for you to think through and then what exactly is a false brother?
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.860]   There's another question you want to think through
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:10.540]   Okay, is that just I mean, it's not really a brother then right? But what is that and what is the truth of the gospel?
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:16.300]   So that the truth of the gospel might remain with you
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:21.060]   We did not yield and subject him to them for one minute so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:21.940]   What is that?
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:22.940]   Okay
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:26.380]   So for the discussion time, this is what I'd like you guys to discuss
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.740]   number one how
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:34.060]   Central is the Lamb of God to your life. It is the theme of the entire scriptures
[01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:38.220]   It is a theme of human history the Lamb of God seated on his throne
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:45.380]   How central is that is the Lamb of God to your life? And how does the Lamb of God affect your day-to-day life?
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:48.100]   Now that's gonna cause you to have to reflect
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.420]   Probably repent some and share
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.340]   secondly
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:58.200]   What is the difference between wanting glory for yourself and wanting to be used to give glory to God?
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:01.940]   Are there people in your life in whom you give God glory?
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:09.780]   There is wrong. That's super annoying. Okay, are there people in your life in whom through whom you give God glory?
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:14.300]   How do you grow and giving glory to God in the lives of the people around you?
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:17.140]   What does that mean?
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:23.900]   Three how discerning are you of the revelations of God in what ways can you grow in areas of discernment?
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:31.420]   How what's a practical step that you can take to grow that and then number four is as you're sharing your
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:36.140]   one through three prayer requests if they come up share it with your table and
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:44.180]   Vulnerability usually breeds vulnerability. So as you share know that you probably aren't the only one struggling to
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:49.380]   Really
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:51.940]   To live all out for the Lord
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:56.780]   But as you pray for each other as you share may that give you strength
[01:42:56.780 --> 01:43:00.280]   Okay, let me pray for you pray for us and then we'll
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.980]   Dismiss father help us
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:06.900]   to apply the things that we've learned and
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:11.140]   Help us Lord God to enjoy just the fellowship of believers
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:19.380]   Not primarily for our joy the Lord that in our love for each other that you may be honored that you may be glorified
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:23.140]   So would you do a mighty work in the lives of your people at this church?
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:25.660]   so that you may be
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:31.460]   Praised and you may be magnified and exalted in our individual lives and in this church
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:34.780]   We love you Lord. We thank you for our time together in Jesus name we pray
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:36.780]   Amen
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:46.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
