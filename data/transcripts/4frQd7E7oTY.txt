[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   [inaudible]
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   All right, good morning, Bryn Community Church.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   First of all, we're going to be having
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   another Bryn service auction.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   So some of you guys who remember doing that during the pandemic,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   our sister Rachel and Andy put on this great auction
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   and was able to raise actually quite a few dollars
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   to be able to support the work that's being done overseas.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   This one is going to be specifically targeting our Indian pastors.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   As I've shared, we've been getting information
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   that some of the pastors are sick,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   some of the Christians there,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and they don't have access to the hospitals
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   and they don't have finances.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   So we're going to be raising funds
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   to support the work that's happening over there.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And so the auction is going to be happening.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So if you have gifts,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   if you have things you want to donate for the auction
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   or even a service, and I remember last time
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   it was kind of like whether it was cooking or cleaning
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   or going, you know, what do you call it, camping,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   or whatever it is, whatever service that you would offer,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   and people will auction that,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   and then whatever funds is raised from that,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   that's going to be used for that purpose.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And along with that, there's another fundraiser
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   that's taking place on Saturday, May 29th at 1.30 p.m.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   It's our first annual Bering Golf Tournament fundraiser,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   and this is going to be going to support our IMB missionaries.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   That's the denomination that we're in.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   It says Southern Baptist,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   and it is the international mission board of our denomination.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And so we'll be sending our funds there
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   to support the ministry that they're doing there.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   So if you play golf, even if you don't play golf,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   and you just want to come and fellowship with the people there,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and this is open for men and women.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Mitchell Kim is in charge of that,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   so if you want to sign up for that, you can sign up with him.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Again, this is taking place on May 29th at 1.30 p.m.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Today, after this service,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   we have a Mother's Day lunch that's taking place,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and so again, if you are a mother or soon to be a mother
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and you want to make an announcement
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   and you want to join that group,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   so right after service, if you go into the cafe area,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   so we started calling that side of the building North Campus
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   and then South Campus,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   until we come up with a better name
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   because for whatever the reason, our street is divided,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   and this is South Mitchell and that's North Mitchell.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   So if you go into that side, the tables are already set up.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   If I can ask you to let the dads go pick up the kids,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   so for once, dads, go pick up your kids,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and then go get your kids so that the moms can go there
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   as soon as they can,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and then the dads will have separate lunch prepared.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   I think it was $5 or something for pizza,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   and so the dads and the kids can eat
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   outside in the courtyard somewhere.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   So that's going to be set up so you can go there
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   so that the moms can just go there immediately,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   and usually every time we do that,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   it takes like 20, 30 minutes to gather all the moms together
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   because usually they're busy taking care of their kids,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   and then make sure everybody is good,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   the father is fed, the kids aren't hurting themselves,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   and then they come in, right?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   So if we can ask the dads to take that role today
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and then let the moms come in
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   so that they can enjoy that time together.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   So we're going to try to start that as soon as possible,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   so as soon as the service is over,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   if you guys can make a beeline,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   and we'll get that started as soon as possible, okay?
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And I want to just make one more push.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I've seen our parking right here,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   not this one directly behind us,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   but diagonally behind that building.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I was looking at it this morning,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and very few people were using that.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I don't think people are used to it.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   And so you probably don't know how to get there.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   You just have to go behind our buildings,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and then I don't know if we have signs over there,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   but the gate is open,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   so actually that's the closest you can come to this building.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   It's actually even closer than parking across the street.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   So if you have it, if you parked way down there,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   just get in the habit of using this site first
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   so you don't have to walk that distance, okay?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   So I just want to make that push
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   so that we know that that's there, okay?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   After we pray for the offering,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   if we can get that ready,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   and then our physical offering box is in the back.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   This morning, David Hyun is going to give his testimony,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   and we'll be baptized this morning.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   especially as we celebrate Mother's Day
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   and all the labor that they've poured into all our lives, Lord God,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   that we may have an example of what it means to love sacrificially.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I pray that you would give them strength.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I pray that you would help us to acknowledge them,

[00:36:45.560 --> 00:37:02.180]   - Hello, my name is David.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.340]   I'm a post-grad in band ministry, and this is my testimony.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.860]   Growing in faith has been a lifelong journey.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.940]   During my childhood, I was blessed to be raised
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.460]   in a Christian household and have the opportunity
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.920]   to begin to hear about God at a young age.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.860]   My parents were active in church and served in many roles.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.220]   My father attended seminary
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.780]   and became a pastor with his own ministry.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.820]   I volunteered, served, and was involved in church
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.160]   in ways that seemed to grow my faith.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.080]   I checked off a lot of boxes as a Christian
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.300]   living in Southern California.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.380]   In reality, I had not even met God
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.740]   and wasn't pursuing His kingdom with all my heart.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.300]   My focus was always advancing
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.980]   my earthly goals and aspirations.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.500]   In my mind, I thought I was walking and living for God,
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.800]   and that God was helping me carry out my plan.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.860]   However, I was actually living for myself
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.980]   and mistakenly believing that I could glorify God
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.300]   with my selective obedience.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.780]   I lived as if I was king of my own life,
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.120]   and I did what's right in my own eyes.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.000]   At best, I was obeying only some of God's commands.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.700]   While in grad school, my eyes were opened
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.060]   to how fragile this world is
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.660]   and how incredibly shallow my faith was.
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.980]   I was surrounded by brilliant individuals
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.140]   who were driven and willing to sacrifice every moment
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.060]   to advance their careers, lives, and their own names.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.420]   I also sought after these things
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.300]   and continued to mistakenly believe
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.860]   that I was doing all this for God.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.500]   I thought that I could give more to God
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.540]   by pursuing my own interests,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.140]   even though that was far from the truth.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.580]   I was still attending church and serving in various roles,
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.720]   but was really wandering away from the presence of God.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.300]   At best, I was obeying most of God's commands.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.620]   While wandering away from the presence of God,
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.100]   my soul became troubled because I knew the example
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.900]   that Jesus had set for me.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.660]   I became so preoccupied with my own life
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.900]   that I couldn't possibly live for God.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.460]   After grad school and coming home to California,
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.380]   I entered into a spiritual desert
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.500]   and recognized I did not have a genuine relationship with Him.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.100]   No matter how much I prayed, read the Word,
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.460]   and attended church, I couldn't enter His presence
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.940]   simply because I could not become righteous
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.040]   by my own efforts.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.500]   Through His mercy and grace,
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.220]   that all the things I had placed my hope and trust in
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.700]   fall one by one.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.420]   Only after I became sick and tired of living for my own life
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.640]   did I understand that His love is greater
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.420]   than anything I could ever comprehend.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.300]   By grace, He allowed me to begin to understand
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.140]   when He said, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.020]   "nor are your ways my ways,
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:45.020]   "and that to obey is better than sacrifice,
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.780]   "and to heed is better than the fat of rams."
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.820]   By grace, He showed me that He is Almighty God
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.260]   and that He shares His glory with no one.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.780]   By grace, God allowed me to understand
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.140]   how to seek after Him with all my heart,
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.400]   and only then did He finally meet with me.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.780]   By grace, He invited me to seek Him
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.580]   and gave me the privilege of possibly comprehending
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.800]   His love and goodness.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.740]   In God's own brilliant way,
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.860]   an indescribable way, indescribable way,
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.900]   He called me to build my life upon the foundation of faith
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.660]   and His righteousness.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.320]   I've learned that for me, there is no prioritizing God
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.860]   over things of this world,
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.080]   and that there is only God's truth and nothing else.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.880]   Through Christ's sacrifice, I'm able to be with God,
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.620]   and I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.260]   and it is now Christ who lives in me.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.540]   I can place my trust and hope in Jesus,
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.420]   who made a way back to God,
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.000]   and walk by faith, believing that slowly but surely,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.740]   I'm becoming the man God has called me to be.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.260]   Thanks to Jesus' sacrifice, I can live a life
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.760]   where my joy, peace, and rest is in His word and presence,
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.860]   and I look forward to a life of repentance,
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.900]   perseverance, belief in the power of Christ's sacrifice,
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.700]   making God king, and giving my very best to obey,
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.740]   not some, not most, but all of God's commands.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.580]   Thank you.
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.740]   (audience applauding)
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:16.500]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.160]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:26.160]  , (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.120]   (audience applauding)
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:42:01.280]   - All right, thank you, David, for that testimony.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.520]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews 12,
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.080]   we're in verse one, two, three,
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:13.040]   and we're gonna be here for a few more weeks.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.300]   Yeah, so as I've been preparing,
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.600]   there's some stuff that I just didn't wanna skim through.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.480]   I wanted to take some time, and we don't have a timeline
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.280]   where we have to finish this by a certain date,
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   so we're just gonna go as the word of God is being revealed,
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.080]   and I didn't even get through the whole sermon for service,
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.760]   so we'll see how long this takes, verse one, two, and three,
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.360]   so let me read this, and we'll jump in.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.280]   Therefore, since we have so great a cloud
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.500]   of witnesses surrounding us,
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.780]   let us also lay aside every encumbrance
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.380]   and the sin which so easily entangles us,
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.940]   and let us run with endurance
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.180]   the race that is set before us,
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.660]   fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.780]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.020]   despising the shame, and has sat down
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.140]   at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.700]   For consider him who has endured such hostility
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.300]   by sinners against himself,
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.100]   so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:08.940]   Let's pray.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:13.580]   Heavenly Father, we give this time to you.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.260]   Asking for a clear understanding of your word,
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.100]   that you would search us and know us
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.360]   and see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.940]   Lord, give us strength to understand.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.540]   Give us strength to persevere.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.660]   And we pray, Father God,
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.960]   that your grace truly would be enough.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:40.900]   You know, as we travel for various reasons,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.060]   whether you go to Asia or go to India
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.900]   or Africa, you know, there are some countries
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.240]   where, you know, like 15, 20 years ago,
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.820]   you don't see anything Western,
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.980]   but you can see it developing.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.900]   And one of the things, signs that you see developing
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.660]   is you see more and more of the Western stuff coming in.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.220]   So, you know, 30 years ago, I would say,
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.020]   what, 20, 30 years ago, when we would go overseas,
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.820]   you know, we can tell if there was any kind
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.500]   of Western influence by looking at McDonald's, right?
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.220]   And you go to McDonald's and you see,
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.740]   it's like, oh, there's a Western influence coming in,
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.260]   you know, and now, I think in the last 15 years,
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.860]   it's switched from McDonald's to Starbucks.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.580]   You can tell the progress or the economy getting better
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.860]   because you see more and more Starbucks.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.780]   And we saw that out in Beijing,
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.220]   and we starting to see that out in India.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.340]   Each time we go, there's more and more Starbucks,
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.180]   just like here, you can run into it everywhere you go.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.140]   I remember when Starbucks was first coming in.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.940]   Some of you guys are a little bit older,
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.660]   remember, you know, that period when it was coming in,
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.540]   I was thinking, like, how is this business gonna take off?
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.140]   You know, coffee's been around forever,
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.300]   and all they're selling is coffee?
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.260]   You know, I know that since then,
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.340]   they've added, like, donuts and all this other stuff,
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.820]   but it was just coffee.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.980]   So I said, these guys are crazy.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.180]   They're gonna do a business just selling coffee,
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.460]   and obviously, since then, I mean,
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.540]   it's one of the fastest growing companies,
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:06.540]   at least in the restaurant markets and coffee business.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:07.980]   And I realized that, you know,
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.340]   part of the reason why coffee, not just Starbucks,
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.540]   but coffee has taken off is because we become addicted,
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.220]   not just to the flavor, but to the caffeine.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.820]   You know, we're all fatigued and tired,
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.860]   and so I remember growing up,
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.220]   we didn't really drink much coffee.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.740]   I didn't start drinking coffee
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.500]   until I was probably about 31 or 32 years old,
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   and the reason why was because I started to teach ESL
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:35.500]   to Korean grandparents, and if I wasn't on my game,
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.140]   you know, I would lose them.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.700]   Their attention span wasn't that great,
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.820]   so I was speaking, you know,
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.260]   I had to speak to them in English and Korean,
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.780]   and so my mind had to be alert all the time,
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.940]   and so, you know, the best way to describe it
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.220]   is kind of giving five-hour sermons five times a week.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.660]   That's how it felt, like standing there just draining.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.580]   I have to constantly think about, you know,
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.420]   what to teach them.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.240]   Do they remember this?
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.780]   What's the next lesson, and who's paying attention?
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.620]   Who gets it?
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.500]   Who doesn't get it?
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.900]   And so I remember thinking,
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.740]   wow, this is exhausting being a teacher,
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.740]   and this is what the teachers must go through
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.780]   watching kids, so I started drinking coffee,
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.900]   and now it's become such a habit,
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.260]   like, you know, whether I need it or not,
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.860]   I have to drink coffee, and then,
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.660]   if I'm tired during the day,
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.020]   I would drink another cup of coffee.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.620]   I try not to drink more than one coffee,
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:26.060]   but, you know, it's become such a habit now.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.600]   I mean, it's just, obviously, it's not just me.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.060]   All through the world now,
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:33.300]   caffeine is kind of what's keeping people going, right?
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.900]   Well, there's a lot of things that we do.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.860]   When we feel physically fatigued,
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.460]   maybe just go exercise, right?
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.780]   Maybe drinking energy drinks or soda,
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.220]   whatever it may be, or just take a walk.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.100]   When we're physically fatigued,
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.660]   put caffeine in, do something so that you can be alert
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.340]   and you can go back to work,
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.720]   but what do you do when you're spiritually fatigued?
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.180]   What do you do when you feel like the energy
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.100]   has been sapped down and you don't have the energy
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:02.380]   to continue on on this path?
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.540]   Where do you turn for that?
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.540]   Because caffeine might be able to give you a little perk
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.260]   and get you alert to be able to do what you need to do,
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.700]   but when you have spiritually been fatigued
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:15.260]   and you don't have the energy to persevere and continue,
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.140]   who do we turn to?
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.920]   How do we get energized?
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.740]   So the text that we're looking at in verse one,
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.980]   in conclusion, the transition that's being made
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.660]   is in conclusion to Christalia.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:28.880]   Everything that's been presented is a therefore,
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.820]   let us run this race with endurance,
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.380]   and that's the imperative in this passage,
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.660]   and that's what he's gonna be talking about
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.740]   in the next two chapters,
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.340]   and every verse is going to be
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.940]   running this race with endurance.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.020]   Well, how do we do that?
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:46.020]   He's not simply saying just dig deep within yourself.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.380]   Just find strength within yourself
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.580]   and just be determined to get this right.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.580]   That's not what he is saying.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:58.780]   If any of you, for any period of time,
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.660]   walked with God with that intention,
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.420]   we're just gonna be more disciplined than I was before.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:05.500]   I'm gonna memorize more scripture
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.700]   than I'm gonna pray more than other,
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.900]   I'm gonna evangelize more than any other person.
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.940]   Eventually, you get fatigued, you get tired,
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.180]   and you just don't have that energy,
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.380]   and then if you keep living this cycle over and over again,
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.620]   that's what, and then we use the term being burnt out.
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:25.100]   He's not simply calling us to be more determined,
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.500]   to be more disciplined, to be more sacrificial.
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:31.720]   He says, we talked about, he says that the imperative is
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.180]   let's run this race with endurance,
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.420]   and he talked about how we need to look,
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.560]   first and foremost, are we committed to this race?
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:45.540]   Are we in this race, this race before us?
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.700]   And then to look behind the cloud of witnesses
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.260]   that have gone, how they did it,
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.420]   what caused them to persevere to the end?
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.280]   And then last week, we looked at to look within.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.740]   Is there anything that I'm doing
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.040]   that is entangling me to hinder this race?
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.060]   What am I engaged in that causes me
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.540]   not to have this appetite for Christ?
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.980]   What are the sins that so easily clings,
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.020]   that we just kind of dismiss and say,
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.260]   well, everybody struggles with it,
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.020]   and then we allow it in our lives
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   without genuinely fighting it,
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.320]   and then the part that we're at this morning is finally,
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.940]   and this really is the main point, the crux of the issue.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:26.140]   Without this, everything else just becomes
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.820]   more things that we need to do, right?
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:34.040]   He says to look up, fix your eyes on Jesus,
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.340]   the author and perfecter of the faith,
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.660]   and then verse three, it says,
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.700]   for consider him who endures us hostility
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.500]   towards sinners against himself.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:49.540]   If we don't get this, if we don't practice this,
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.920]   church can easily become a place where week after week,
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.980]   you're being reminded what you're not doing.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.580]   You're not doing enough.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.920]   I mean, probably the most tired people in the world
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.960]   are mothers with small children at home, right?
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.360]   You're fatigued.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.120]   24/7, you're giving to small children,
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:18.360]   and then you come to church, you need to be more involved.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.920]   You need to be more giving.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.200]   You need to be more sacrificial, pick up your cross.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.840]   Jesus did this for you.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.840]   Why can't you do this for him?
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.040]   So no matter how nicely and graciously I say it,
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.040]   that's what gets into your ear,
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.280]   and then just, you know, life is hard enough as it is,
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   but you end up just piling up week after week
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.440]   this burden of what I should be doing that I'm not doing,
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.660]   and if you've been there for a long time,
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.840]   this just is kind of piled up,
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.580]   so you end up just kind of sucking it up.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.320]   I'm a Christian, so what else am I gonna do?
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.880]   He's not simply saying be more disciplined.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.880]   He's not simply saying be more determined,
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.880]   although those are things that he does call us to do.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.180]   He says in order to be fueled,
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:04.300]   the ultimate fuel, he says, to fix our eyes on Jesus.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.740]   Some of your translations simply says look to Jesus.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.260]   The word there in Greek is much more intense.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.500]   It's much more precise.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.540]   He's not simply saying just to casually look,
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.400]   look at the stars or look at these chairs.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.860]   The reason why in the ESV or the NASB,
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:24.020]   it uses the word fix is because it has a meaning
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.900]   of laser focus, to make a determination.
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.180]   You're intensely looking at something.
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:36.420]   This word for looking or to fix our eyes on Jesus,
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.120]   and he said there's two reasons for that,
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:42.300]   because he's the author, and he's the finisher of the rate,
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.580]   perfecter of the faith.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.340]   Not only is he the one that we are justified by,
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.800]   he's also the one who will sanctify us.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.580]   Again, if we're not careful, we get justified by Christ,
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:56.940]   and then the sanctification is just discipleship.
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.580]   Just hook them up with somebody who's more mature,
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.580]   and then just kind of through learning and telling
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.980]   and discipleship, that that's gonna happen.
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.540]   Justification, we're completely helpless,
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.160]   but sanctification, it's 100% us.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.180]   He said no, Jesus Christ is the author,
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.500]   and he, Jesus Christ, is also the perfecter of our faith,
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.860]   who will bring us into completion.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.980]   That's what Paul says when he says Philippians 1:6.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.940]   He who began a good work in you,
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:28.460]   he will carry it onto completion, onto the day of Christ.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.020]   Now, that does not mean that human effort is not there.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.780]   That does not mean that God doesn't call us
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.940]   to discipleship and pick up the cross,
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:39.220]   but in the end, the fuel that causes us to continue
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:42.540]   and to persevere is Christ himself.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:47.700]   To look intensely at Jesus.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:51.060]   It has two specific meanings in application.
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.900]   One, the word to look, to fix,
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.480]   has the idea of gawking at something, to behold something.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:03.640]   You ever experience something where something is so great,
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.720]   whether you travel somewhere or maybe you see movies,
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.460]   people standing in front of Grand Canyon,
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.060]   just they can't take their eyes off of Grand Canyon?
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:15.100]   I remember as a young child when my family
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.580]   decided to move from Philadelphia to Kansas,
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.820]   my parents would stop by at Niagara Falls,
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.980]   and I probably was about 10 or 11 years old at that time,
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:28.980]   and I remember so vividly standing in front of Niagara Falls
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.940]   just being awed, even as a child.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:35.100]   Just the waterfall, it just looked so amazing.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.820]   And even though it was a brief time,
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.060]   even though I was a young child,
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.340]   that made a deep impression.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:43.060]   And I remember a few years ago,
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:46.320]   we went back to look at it and it just didn't look as high.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.780]   You know, the things that you look at when you're a child
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.020]   or when you go back as an adult,
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.620]   it just doesn't live up to your memory.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:53.940]   You know, I think part of the reason was,
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.420]   obviously I'm older, but the other part of it is,
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.020]   I've seen other things.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.460]   You know, I remember going to Kenya
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.340]   and this remote part of Kenya, we were at a waterfall.
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.960]   We drove probably about four hours to get there,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.640]   but once we got there, there was a waterfall
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.320]   that probably was about three times that height.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.700]   And I remember looking at that,
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.620]   it's like, wow, this makes Niagara Falls look tiny.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.660]   But the point of my story is,
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.940]   there's things that we look at
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:22.940]   that just by the sheer magnitude of what you're seeing,
[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:26.040]   causes you to gaze at something, to gawk at something.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.060]   All right, and it may not just be scenery,
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:31.160]   it could be something or someone,
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.500]   maybe someone's so talented,
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.060]   that it causes you to look at it and gaze at it.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.900]   And I remember, again, some of you guys
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:38.720]   are a little bit older,
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.780]   everything I say may be a little bit outdated,
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.780]   but do you know who Whitney Houston is?
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.700]   You do, okay, good.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.300]   I'm connecting with a few of you, all right.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.200]   I remember the first time hearing Whitney Houston
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.420]   sing that song, "I Will Always Love You."
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.060]   Remember, at the movie, I have to look it up,
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:58.600]   it was from the movie "Bodyguard," right?
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:03.140]   I don't know, I don't remember what year this was, right?
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:06.380]   And I wasn't that old, but I remember listening to that song
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.020]   and I was like, I never heard somebody
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.260]   hit a note that high before.
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.860]   And she was so, I was just amazed, right?
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.480]   And it just made a deep impression, right?
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.160]   This idea of gawking and looking and beholding
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:23.120]   is something beyond you, is so beyond you, so magnificent.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.480]   So you can, scenery, you can be talent,
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.520]   whether it's sports, whatever it is,
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.500]   it just naturally causes you to worship.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:35.700]   That's the word here, to behold.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:39.920]   And in 1 John 3, verse one, in the NASB, it says,
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.640]   "See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us."
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.960]   In the King James, the literal understanding,
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.760]   it says to behold.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:52.640]   Look intently how great a love the Father has bestowed
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.080]   on us that we would be called children of God
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.360]   and such we are.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.520]   That sinners like us, rebellious sinners like us,
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:04.880]   behold, gawk at, fix your eyes,
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:09.880]   that we would become children of God.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:13.240]   So that's the idea behind fixing your eyes upon Christ,
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.440]   not just to casually look, not just to consider,
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.240]   but to think deeply about what it is that we have.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:23.640]   Part of the reason why there is such superficiality
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.920]   in the way that we live our life
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.320]   is because we have such superficial understanding
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.220]   of the gospel.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:32.920]   Especially if you've grown up in the church
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.720]   and you heard the gospel in Sunday school,
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:36.880]   and you say, yeah, I believe that.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.800]   Yeah, what is the gospel?
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.040]   Jesus, I'm a sinner, Jesus came, died for us,
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.960]   and he was crucified, resurrected on my behalf,
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.200]   and now I go to heaven.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.520]   But then we've never seriously asked that question.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.920]   In fact, if you don't evangelize,
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.960]   you have no idea how many holes there are
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.760]   in your understanding of the gospel.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.640]   'Cause you've never been tested.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.200]   No one's ever pushed back.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.400]   So you never ask the question, oh, Jesus loved me,
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.240]   this I know for the Bible tells me so, the end.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.600]   And then somebody say, why does he have to die?
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.360]   Because I'm a sinner.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.380]   But why die?
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:19.240]   All the mothers in this room, future mothers,
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.280]   we all know that we love our kids,
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.080]   and that's why we have Mother's Day, Father's Day.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.560]   But you don't tell your kids, I loved you so much,
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.600]   I died for you.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.680]   What does that mean?
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.600]   In fact, I loved you so much, I'm gonna bleed for you now.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.360]   You don't bleed and then take the blood,
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.640]   I love you so much.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.440]   What is that?
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.920]   Right?
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.200]   But sometimes we hear it so much,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.480]   we just accept it without really asking
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:50.160]   what that sounds like, not truly understanding
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.920]   the meaning behind any of this stuff.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.520]   Why did he have to be crucified?
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.520]   Why does he have to die and then resurrect again?
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.560]   What does all that mean?
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.240]   But we just heard it, and we have a superficial
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.400]   understanding, superficial appreciation
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.800]   of what we sing about and learn about, and even share.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.480]   But because we haven't gazed, we haven't beheld
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.360]   and actually wrestled with what it is
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.040]   that we actually have, we just kinda,
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.760]   oh, Jesus loves me, so he died for me,
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.440]   so now I gotta go work.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.280]   Tell me what to do.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.760]   I'm gonna go make disciples of all the nations.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.840]   And so we're given to work, we work hard, we sacrifice,
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:30.080]   but there is no beholding in our hearts.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.680]   And as a result of that, we labor, we strive,
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.400]   we sacrifice, and then we get burnt out.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.720]   And then we labor, we strive, we get burnt out,
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:43.400]   and then something else happens, we get encouraged,
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.080]   and we get back up in this cycle over and over again.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.000]   And if that's the cycle that you've been in
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.920]   four years, five years, 10 years, 20 years,
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.960]   something inside of you just dies,
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.720]   that you don't have hope anymore,
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.640]   that this is not gonna work,
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.960]   this hard work doesn't lead to anything.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.640]   The problem was not that we worked hard.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.880]   The problem wasn't that we didn't work hard enough.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:16.520]   The problem was the fuel that we need
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:20.760]   to cause all these things to happen wasn't happening.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.960]   And that's why he says to behold.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.000]   First, we need to run this race with endurance,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.200]   and he says to behold, fix your eyes on Jesus.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:32.120]   Ephesians chapter 360 through 19.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.040]   Paul's prayer after laying about how he predestined us,
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   he elected us, he adopted us
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.240]   from before the creation of the world,
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.920]   and he's just basically laying out
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.560]   how he loved us and saved us.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.280]   And then he says, after telling them this, he says,
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.240]   he prays that he would grant you,
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.680]   God would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.880]   to be strengthened with power through the Spirit
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.120]   in the inner man, so that Christ would dwell
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.400]   in your hearts through faith,
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.520]   and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.160]   may be able to comprehend with all the saints.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.360]   Let me stop right there.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.820]   There is a difference between revelation and illumination.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.160]   Revelation, anybody can have it at any time.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.400]   Open up the Bible, read what it says,
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.520]   and then regurgitate that to other people.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.380]   That's revelation, right?
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.040]   That just requires your effort.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:24.160]   Working hard, memorize scripture, right?
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.320]   That's revelation.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.420]   He's not talking about revelation,
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.680]   because revelation was already given to them.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.280]   Right?
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.100]   He already gave it to them.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.760]   So when he says to comprehend
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.600]   what it is that you have been given,
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.040]   he's not simply talking about having a better or higher IQ
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.760]   or putting more effort into this.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.320]   He's talking that the Holy Spirit,
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.680]   to take what was revealed to you,
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.160]   so that you would open your eyes to see,
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.360]   with all the saints, the breadth, the length,
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.600]   the height, and the depth,
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.960]   and to know the love of Christ,
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.760]   which surpasses all knowledge,
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.720]   that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.120]   That beyond revelation,
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.760]   that God, through the Holy Spirit, would illuminate you,
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.080]   that you would begin to behold what it is that you have.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.280]   And in this beholding
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.660]   is what fuels everything else that happens.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:24.300]   You know, I think many of you already know
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.520]   that I'm a cynic by nature, right?
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.520]   And especially now, where you have Yelp,
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.400]   I know we have a generation where you have five stars,
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.120]   and we gotta go, right?
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.500]   I don't trust any of it, right?
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.400]   I've gone to some of these five-star coffee shops,
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.940]   five-star boba shops, five-star sushi shops,
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.360]   and I can't think of a single time where I came back,
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.160]   it's like, that deserves five stars, right?
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.180]   It just never lives up to the hype, right?
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.000]   And part of the reason why it doesn't live up to the hype
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.280]   is because that experience you had,
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.280]   you know, it may have been that one person that was there.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.520]   Maybe the person was making that particular sandwich,
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.420]   did a great job.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.840]   And maybe you have a different kind of taste bud than I do,
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.040]   and you like something spicy.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.880]   Maybe I don't like something spicy.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.800]   It may have been you were with a group of friends,
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.080]   and it wasn't just about the food,
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.560]   but the environment that you were.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.000]   There's a lot of things that go into
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.840]   somebody just having a good time.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.040]   They've marketed that thing well.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.240]   So when I go there, and I specifically eat that,
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.840]   I really get excited.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.960]   And part of the reason is I'm not a good person, right?
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.520]   Part of the reason, I'm a cynic by nature.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.280]   I just don't trust these things.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.480]   And I tasted, part of the reason why is because
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.360]   I've traveled a lot, and I've eaten a lot of things.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.960]   And so when I compare it to all of this,
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.480]   it just never lives up to the hype, right?
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.120]   And even Niagara Falls, I told you, I was so awed by it.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.320]   And so second time I went, I was expecting,
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.600]   it's like, man, we're gonna go see Niagara Falls.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.760]   And I remember going there and saying, huh,
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.680]   there's a lot of water just falling.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.840]   (laughs)
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.520]   It just didn't live up to that hype, right?
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.760]   No matter what it is.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.200]   And that's true, whether it is scenery,
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.520]   whether you travel, whether it is food.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.000]   It's like that even with people.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.760]   It just doesn't live up to the hype.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.440]   So, you know, when I read biographies of people,
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.360]   I'm always thinking behind my head,
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.680]   what is he really like?
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.080]   I know this is what they're saying about him,
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.320]   but what is he really like, right?
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.320]   That's why it's hard for me to get excited.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:30.360]   But I can tell you with all honesty
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:36.040]   that over 40 years, it's almost, is it 40?
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.680]   I forget how many years, right?
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.840]   40, almost 40 years.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.240]   Almost 40 years that I've been a Christian,
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:50.160]   that the love of Christ is far deeper
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.960]   than I realized 40 years ago.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:58.760]   It is far wider than what I remembered when I first met him.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.360]   It is far higher than I could possibly explain.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:10.140]   Nothing in this world lives up to that hype,
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.520]   but the love of Christ.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.960]   And I remember Corrie Tamboon,
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   again, this is one of these things
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.680]   that I remember so much, and I know I shared it before,
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.360]   but I remember Corrie Tamboon,
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.680]   some of you guys who know her,
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.160]   she's the author of the book "The Hiding Place,"
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.440]   and it's her testimony about how her whole family
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.000]   got slaughtered during the Holocaust.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.920]   And then she became an evangelist.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.000]   And how before she became famous
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.200]   and was able to pay her bills,
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.920]   she said she used to sell watches.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.680]   And after she would make a good sale,
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.880]   she would walk away from that,
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.040]   said always feeling bad about the sale.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.220]   And the reason why was that it would bother her conscience
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.200]   that she had to hype up the watch,
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.840]   in order to get the sale.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.000]   This watch is great, it's a great price,
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.500]   it's not gonna let you down, and so she sold it,
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.520]   but even though she was a great salesperson,
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.700]   she would walk away always feeling guilty
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.420]   that maybe I wasn't fully honest.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.060]   And then she became an evangelist,
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:10.600]   and she began to share the testimony about Jesus Christ,
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.720]   and she would walk away with the same guilt,
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.600]   but for a completely different reason.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.640]   And she would share how,
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.120]   no matter how much she would share about Jesus,
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.420]   she would walk away thinking
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:23.960]   that maybe I didn't do God's love justice.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.480]   Maybe I didn't do justice to his grace.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.960]   There's nothing in this world
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.640]   that if we gawk at it long enough, does not fade.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.280]   There's no food, there's no place,
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.400]   there's no human being that you will put on a pedestal
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   and watch and behold, where as time passes,
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.360]   that it becomes greater than last year
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.320]   and greater than that the year after that.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.840]   Nothing in creation lives up to that kind of scrutiny,
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.760]   except Christ.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:02.820]   That's why when he says to behold, to look, to gawk at,
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:07.800]   because where our fuel comes from
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.760]   is knowing the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.580]   You and I do not have the inner ability
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.360]   to just simply say no to temptation.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.440]   When we're tempted by things,
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.040]   tempted by hatred and anger,
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.720]   to simply say no because we're strong,
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.020]   because we're disciplined.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:31.200]   You and I do not have that ability.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.120]   So without beholding who Christ is,
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.640]   all Christianity becomes is more things
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.080]   that you're not doing right.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:46.000]   C.S. Lewis says this in his book, "The Weight of Glory."
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.560]   "It would seem that our Lord finds our desires
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.040]   "not too strong, but too weak.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.600]   "We are half-hearted creatures,
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.840]   "fooling about with drink and sex and ambition
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.720]   "when infinite joy is offered us.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.420]   "Like an ignorant child who wants to go on
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.340]   "making mud pies in a slum,
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:06.100]   "because he cannot imagine what is meant
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.100]   "by the offer of a holiday at the sea,
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.520]   "we are far too easily pleased."
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.440]   He's describing an individual who gazed at,
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   maybe have a glimpse of his glory,
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.080]   and then spent the rest of his life
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.920]   gawking at the world, being tempted,
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.560]   constantly distracted, and we're so easily pleased.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.280]   Easily pleased with food, easily pleased with travel,
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.560]   easily pleased with circumstance.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.460]   And that's what causes us to drift.
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.720]   So no wonder Christianity becomes a burden.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.320]   You know, we think of Christianity as a pick up your cross,
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.720]   deny yourself.
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.840]   Jesus loved you so much, how could you not do that for him?
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.960]   And we live this burden that we owe him,
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.440]   and so we have to keep doing more of this.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.580]   And of course, we run empty.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:02.600]   You know what it says in Matthew 13 to 44 to 46?
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.040]   It says, "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:09.080]   "hidden in the field, which a man found and hid,
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.480]   "and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.120]   "and buys that field."
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.680]   You notice here the motivation behind
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.800]   why he's selling all of this stuff?
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.140]   Because he recognized the value
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.960]   of the treasure that he found.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.120]   And so when he sacrifices, he's given up everything,
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.440]   what does he do?
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.120]   You say, "Oh my God, that's so expensive.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.400]   "I gotta give up all of this so I can have that?"
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:40.340]   He says, "From joy over it."
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.920]   Because he saw the value.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.320]   And so everything that he had was worth selling,
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:50.920]   and in joy sold everything so that he can have this.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.760]   See, the difference between an individual
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.120]   who is struggling to sacrifice and discipline
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.920]   versus somebody who is eager to follow
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.540]   is how he recognizes the treasure in Christ.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.320]   If Christ is not the treasure,
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.360]   you will not overcome the temptation.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.700]   How can you when everybody around you is going after that?
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.240]   It's so nice, especially where you and I live.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.600]   We live 15 minutes away from the beach,
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.600]   30 minutes, 40 minutes if you drive fast, to the mountains.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.000]   Disneyland over here, Knott's Berry Farm,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.200]   what else is down there?
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.880]   Movie theaters, all the food, you know one thing,
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   the more I travel, the more I know
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.120]   that this is the best place in the world.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.880]   Even the food tastes better.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:53.080]   Here, everything, we have access to pretty much everything.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.240]   I literally never need to leave Irvine.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.740]   Everything that I fleshly desire is in Irvine.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.080]   How are you going to win over that temptation?
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.400]   Simply by saying no?
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.920]   Simply by being more disciplined?
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.880]   Simply by having accountability group
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.060]   to shame you if you don't?
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.080]   You and I don't have that power.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.080]   He says because he saw the treasure of what he had,
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.800]   he didn't wanna lose it.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.120]   So for joy of having that,
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.240]   he was willing to sell everything to get that.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.360]   See, if we're not beholding Christ
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.680]   and do not understand the breadth, length, height,
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.360]   and depth of the love of Christ,
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.760]   it just becomes more work.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.760]   More work.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.200]   Life is hard enough as it is,
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.360]   and then you go to the church,
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.720]   and you gotta do more work.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:57.240]   That's why he says to fix your eyes on Jesus.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.640]   To fix it, not just to look at it,
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.520]   not just casually think about it.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.840]   He says to fix, don't take your eyes off of him.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.680]   That's what that means.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.040]   Because the moment we forget the treasure
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.360]   that we have in Christ,
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.140]   we easily get entangled and fall into temptation.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.400]   That's exactly what Apostle Paul meant
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.440]   in comparison to the surpassing knowledge
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.540]   of knowing Jesus Christ.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.440]   Surpassing knowledge meaning,
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.840]   this is beyond just revelation,
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.680]   beyond me telling you.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.920]   This is beyond anything that the world can offer you.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.600]   Surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.240]   Everything else became rubbish.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:34.760]   Roman citizen, wealthy family, highest education,
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.520]   already well-known celebrity,
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.440]   possibly a Sanhedrin member already,
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.840]   a senator in the nation of Israel.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.960]   For any Jew, Pharisee among Pharisee,
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.520]   asked the law, he says, perfect.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.880]   For a Jew, he's already on the top.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.220]   But he says in comparison,
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.040]   in comparison to the treasure he found in Christ,
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.720]   it became rubbish.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.880]   He didn't make it rubbish,
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.500]   it became rubbish in comparison.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:09.020]   So when our eyes are taken off of Christ,
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:12.240]   there is nothing else in this world
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.840]   that's gonna save you from the temptation
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.220]   that we are surrounded by constantly.
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:23.120]   You know, I remember when,
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.480]   right before I became a Christian,
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.320]   I was obsessed with baseball.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.960]   Right, because that was my first love, baseball.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.680]   Before basketball, anything else.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.720]   And my friends decided that we're gonna make
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.480]   the Burbank High School baseball team.
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.520]   So we spent every single minute that we had, right?
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.440]   It probably saved us from a lot of trouble,
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.000]   'cause we were getting into a lot of trouble prior to that,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.120]   but when we decided to play baseball,
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.040]   every opportunity we had, we went on the baseball field,
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.100]   and we had a guy who wanted to play shortstop,
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:56.080]   and so we would just bat to him, right?
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.800]   Hour, two hours, every day.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.480]   And it's my turn, so I would take the glove
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.600]   and go to the left field,
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.320]   and then they would just pop it up, right?
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.480]   Pop up the ball.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.120]   And I said, "Well, put the ball over there,
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:08.580]   "so let me see how much distance I can cover,
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.240]   "so hit it far from me."
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.680]   We did that every day, every opportunity we had,
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.540]   because we were preparing to try
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:16.640]   to get on this baseball team.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.000]   Well, tryouts came out, you know,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.240]   it started out in December,
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.160]   and it was about a week of tryouts,
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.440]   and then we took a break,
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.560]   and then the second part was gonna happen
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.520]   after the break.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.040]   Well, in between that, I became a Christian.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.940]   It radically changed my life.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.880]   And we spent so much time preparing for it,
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.000]   going to the batting cage,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   and trying to get on this team that we want so much,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.920]   but all of a sudden, I meet Christ,
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.000]   and I just completely forgot.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.340]   I don't even remember wrestling about this decision,
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.480]   because their Bible study was Friday night,
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.800]   and all the games were happening Friday night,
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.480]   all the practices were happening Friday night.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.800]   And so I don't even remember thinking,
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.320]   "Should I, should I?"
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.400]   I just don't remember that,
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.960]   because what would be better than this God that I met?
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.120]   So I used to live in Burbank,
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.120]   and one of the leaders would come
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.280]   and pick me up right after school at 3.30 or 4 o'clock,
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.320]   be in LA, Bible study starts at seven, finishes at nine.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.120]   We go have dinner, and then from 11 to one,
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.620]   or two in the morning, we'd have overnight prayer,
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:23.960]   and then sometimes we'd just sleep over
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.000]   at the church just sleeping on just,
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.740]   you know, on the floor, waking up,
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.600]   mowing the lawn, you know, of the church,
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.960]   'cause that's the only way they would let us stay there.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.880]   And then waking up, just passing out pamphlets,
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.840]   and trying to evangelize,
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.440]   and I would come home sometimes like late Saturday,
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.600]   you know, and I just remember,
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.600]   my parents never asked me where I was.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.560]   You know, I think part of the reason
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.720]   was 'cause I was getting into so much trouble prior to that.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.260]   She knew I was at church,
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.840]   so that whatever I was doing over there
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.280]   is gonna be much better than me not doing that.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.640]   But I remember that so vividly.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.280]   I don't remember struggling to let it go,
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.320]   because at that time, my mind was blown.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.160]   God is real?
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.320]   Heaven and hells is real?
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.240]   And that God cares about me?
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.760]   And then this is the Bible study that I need to attend
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.260]   to connect with this God,
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:28.120]   versus I get to throw this white ball around with these guys?
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.120]   I wasn't a super Christian.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.460]   I wasn't discipled, I wasn't, you know,
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.460]   I wasn't more disciplined than the next person,
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:39.500]   I wasn't more noble,
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.700]   I wasn't more righteous than anybody else.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.560]   My eyes got open, I beheld his glory.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.500]   That's why in Revelation,
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.060]   when it talks to the church of Ephesus,
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.960]   he says, "Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.460]   "Remember when you first beheld God.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.060]   "Remember when the gospel first came into you.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:04.400]   "Remember how excited you were about singing,
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.100]   "about Bible study, about prayer meetings,
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.300]   "about evangelism."
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.900]   You notice the difference between somebody
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.140]   who just became a Christian,
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.540]   versus somebody who's been a Christian for a while?
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:16.060]   Somebody who's been a Christian for a while,
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.100]   and they've become very good at this game,
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.720]   like what is required of this church?
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.560]   What is mandatory?
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.400]   So we say, "Hey, we're gonna have a meeting."
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.560]   And one of the first questions we think,
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.960]   is it mandatory?
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.940]   Right, another, am I gonna be judged?
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.560]   Right?
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.640]   Yes, you will be judged if you don't come.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.040]   So you better come, right?
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.200]   So, oh, we're gonna be judged, okay,
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.960]   then we have to come.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.360]   Versus you meet a new Christian,
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.500]   am I allowed to come?
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:46.240]   Is it okay if I come?
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.420]   Am I allowed to sit here?
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.260]   Can I, can I attend Bible study?
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.100]   Right?
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:55.520]   The difference between the two,
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.940]   is that the young Christian's eyes beheld Christ,
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.540]   and he realized the privilege that he has
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.400]   to have access to God.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.940]   The privilege that he or she has to worship.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:12.820]   The privilege to be a part of a community of people
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.940]   to worship God,
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.580]   versus somebody who's been a Christian for a while,
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:16.540]   and is like, do I have to?
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.500]   Is it mandatory?
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.820]   Will I be judged?
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:23.020]   Even the way we ask questions, is this sin?
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:24.820]   Right?
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.420]   These are all questions that are coming from
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.540]   somebody who has been burdened,
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.320]   and there's no fuel fueling them.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.220]   Just meeting the minimum standards.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:36.140]   You and I do not have that ability
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.460]   just to suck it up and keep it going,
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:39.780]   if we're not beholding Christ.
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.540]   You know how you can tell somebody's beholding Christ?
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.500]   They can't contain it.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.340]   They can't contain it.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:51.220]   Evangelism just doesn't happen.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.700]   Tuesday at three o'clock, evangelism,
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.700]   okay, now I gotta evangelize.
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.660]   Somebody who's beholding Christ, sit down.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:01.220]   Sit down and ask them, what did you do today?
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.780]   That's enough to get them going.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:08.260]   Somebody who's beholding Christ, fixated on Christ,
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:10.920]   oh, let's have fellowship.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.560]   We're gonna have, next Wednesday at three o'clock,
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.340]   you know, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna say these things,
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:17.940]   I'm gonna do these things.
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:20.860]   Somebody who's beholding Christ, just ask them.
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.780]   What do you like to do for fun?
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.700]   Just ask them.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.320]   Because it's abundant.
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.700]   It's what they're beholding.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:34.900]   Just comes out because, just like if you watched a movie
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:37.700]   that you were just enamored, wow, that was great!
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:40.180]   You don't have to ask them.
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.260]   They'll tell you.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.060]   Right?
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.540]   You almost get annoyed, stop telling me!
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.980]   But because they were so impacted by that,
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.020]   they'll tell you.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:58.860]   That's why he's saying, behold, fix your eyes upon Christ,
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:04.140]   that we may have a deepening understanding
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.480]   of the breadth, length, height, and depth
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.620]   of the love of Christ.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.680]   The second meaning behind this is not simply to behold,
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.760]   but to look intently for help.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.960]   Kind of like the way we use the word when we say,
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.580]   who do you look to when you are in trouble?
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:25.260]   Who do you look to when you have financial problems?
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:28.680]   Government, the bank, your job, yourself?
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.600]   Who do you look to when you are discouraged?
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.600]   Who do you look to, right, when you feel lost or lonely?
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.400]   So we use that word look to look at something for help.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.940]   Your friends, church leaders, government, money.
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.960]   In Psalm 121 it says, I will lift up my eyes
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.920]   to the mountains, from where shall my help come?
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.360]   My help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.240]   In other words, the person that I'm beholding,
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.800]   this person that I'm looking to for help,
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.960]   he created the universe.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.440]   That's why the Bible always, when the Bible introduces us
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:14.440]   to God, you notice how often the Bible says,
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.760]   God the creator?
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:21.280]   Repeatedly, God who created the universe.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.040]   That God who created your inner being.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.200]   Why is he saying that?
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.120]   Meaning that his power cannot be exhausted.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.400]   He's all powerful.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:33.320]   The God that you are looking to doesn't have a limit
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.600]   in their bank account, doesn't have limit in resources.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.400]   He's God the creator.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.200]   He's the one that I run to.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.720]   He will not allow your foot to slip.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.980]   He who keeps you will not slumber.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:49.860]   You know, probably most of us, most of us,
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.360]   the closest thing that you and I can relate to,
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.920]   to agape love, is the love that you and I receive
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.000]   from our mothers.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.820]   And even if they're not the best, they're sinners too,
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:04.760]   but probably the closest to somebody who is willing
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.740]   to sacrifice their well-being in order that you and I
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.040]   could eat and live and sleep comfortably,
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.900]   most of us will probably say it's our mothers.
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:17.080]   Deservedly so.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.580]   Because they sacrifice.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.840]   It's hard being a mother.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.260]   I mean, you can't be selfish when you have kids around.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.420]   Because if a mother is selfish, children die.
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:33.700]   Right, and that's not an exaggeration.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:37.440]   If a mother is selfish, children don't eat.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.300]   If the mother is selfish, they're not protected.
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:43.660]   They're gonna run around naked, starve to death.
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.380]   That's what's gonna happen if the mother is selfish.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:49.260]   So the closest thing that you and I can experience,
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:51.060]   oh, that's kinda like that.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:55.000]   But even the mothers grow weary.
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.300]   Even the best of mothers get tired.
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:05.780]   Even the best of mothers are human and sinners themselves.
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:10.740]   So he says, but the God that we look to,
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.860]   he keeps Israel and we'll neither slumber nor sleep.
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.040]   The Lord is your keeper.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.540]   The Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:21.020]   The sun will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.020]   The Lord will protect you from all evil.
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.180]   He will keep your soul.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:27.700]   The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:31.060]   from the time forth and forever.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:35.140]   The Lord will.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.820]   Anything else that we are beholding for our strength,
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.020]   anything else that we are turning to,
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.480]   eventually will let you down.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.640]   My guess is you've probably experienced that already.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.420]   Whether it's an institution, whether it's your circumstance,
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:54.780]   whether it was the government, or maybe it was a leader,
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.300]   whatever it is that you turn to
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:01.860]   that replaces where only God can be,
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:05.380]   eventually will let you down.
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:08.720]   'Cause nothing lives up to that scrutiny, nothing.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.900]   Not your husband, not your wife, not your children,
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:13.880]   not your circumstance, not your leader,
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.620]   not your pastor, not your elders.
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:19.940]   Nothing lives up to that scrutiny but God himself.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:23.500]   That's why in order to run this race with perseverance,
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.300]   we need to fix our eyes on Jesus who started the race,
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.660]   and he's going to be the one who finishes the race,
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:32.980]   and only those who are gazing, beholding,
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:37.300]   and growing in beholding, will persevere in their race.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:41.260]   I remember a pastor years ago described
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:45.880]   Christians beholding Christ in eternity
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.520]   like an ant trying to describe an elephant.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.580]   And the ant would get on the trunk and say,
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:57.020]   oh, the elephant is like this, it's long and slinky.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:58.140]   And then he would take a few steps
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.600]   and end up on the trunk, he's like, oh, I was wrong.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.540]   It's actually white and very tough.
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.220]   And then he would walk over to the ice.
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:08.940]   Actually, it's very liquidy, right?
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.900]   And so every few steps he takes,
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.220]   he recognizes a different part of the elephant.
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.500]   He's like, well, what is he, who is he?
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:16.980]   Well, that's a tiny little ant
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:20.180]   that's trying to describe something gigantic.
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.260]   And so none of it is wrong,
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:25.780]   but not one thing is ever comprehensive.
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:30.580]   And he described how us beholding Christ
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.880]   is going to be like that, but far greater.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:38.280]   But for all eternity, we're gonna be gawking at him,
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.500]   and every time we turn around, we see a different aspect.
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.940]   That God's love is much deeper than I thought.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:48.500]   It's much wider than I thought.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.800]   Much higher than I thought.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.820]   God was much holier than I possibly imagined.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:56.700]   God is more worthy than I could have possibly told.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:01.300]   And for all eternity, he is completely eternal,
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.300]   always immutable, is going to inspire worship.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:11.580]   And it is that God that he is referring to
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.300]   that in order to run this race, to finish this race,
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.800]   to fix our eyes upon Jesus, the author, the beginner,
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.240]   and the one who will finish the race,
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.840]   the fuel to be able to persevere.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:27.880]   Let me finish with this in Isaiah 40, 28 to 31.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.220]   Do you not know, have you not heard,
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.820]   the everlasting God, the Lord,
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.780]   the creator of the ends of the earth,
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.460]   does not become weary or tired.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.300]   His understanding is inscrutable.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.020]   He gives strength to the weary.
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:43.540]   To him who lacks might, he increases power.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.860]   Though youths grow weary and tired,
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:48.840]   and vigorous young men stumble badly,
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.600]   yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.100]   They will mount up with wings like eagles.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.200]   They will run and not get tired.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.280]   They will walk and not become weary.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.320]   For parents, especially for moms on Mother's Day,
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.300]   thank you for your sacrifice.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:12.200]   And I know, especially whether you are a veteran mom
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.840]   or you're a brand new mom,
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.960]   the sacrifices that you make and to present
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.440]   what agape love looks like to the family,
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.380]   to the children.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:28.160]   But along with that, I wanna make this very clear.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.720]   Your love is not enough.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:36.680]   No matter how much you pour into your children,
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.060]   your love is not sufficient enough.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:44.320]   Your love, no matter how much you sacrifice,
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.760]   will not be enough to save your child.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:55.960]   The only love that can change a lost soul,
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:00.680]   that his identity is changed as a child of God for eternity,
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.100]   is when they also behold this love for themselves.
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:08.500]   So the best that you and I could do,
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.440]   the best that a mother can do, is help them see that.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.160]   And the best way for you to do that
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.560]   is for yourself to behold that, to be a witness of that.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.660]   Our love is not enough.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:31.240]   My shepherding in this church is not enough.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:38.560]   My preaching, organization skills, sacrifice is not enough.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.760]   That's why the primary goal every Sunday
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.340]   is to help you see that Christ is worthy,
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:52.380]   that he is worthy of our attention,
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.320]   he is worthy of our sacrifice,
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.320]   that he is worthy to follow,
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.160]   he's worthy to let go of this world.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.200]   'Cause only when you behold the same Christ
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.160]   would you also pick up your cross and follow him,
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.000]   behold him.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.800]   You and I are not gifted enough,
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.560]   we are not strong enough, we're not disciplined enough,
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.040]   but by the grace of God,
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:25.440]   he has called us to be his witness, to be his witness.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:31.440]   So let's witness this glory, let's witness this love,
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.760]   and tell the world what they do not see,
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.260]   so that they also may come
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.600]   and know this Christ for themselves.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.440]   Let's pray.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.200]   (pages rustling)
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:47.560]   Again, as our worship team comes up,
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.880]   if I can ask you to take some time
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.160]   to let the word of God dwell in your hearts.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.240]   If you've grown up in the church,
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.360]   and you just say, yeah, I know Jesus died for me,
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.700]   I believe that, so I'm gonna go to heaven,
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.720]   and that's your level of Christianity.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:06.680]   You don't understand what you're worshiping,
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.540]   you don't understand what you're seeing,
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:11.400]   you don't understand the word of God that's being opened.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.400]   To humble yourself before the Lord and ask,
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.280]   do I really know this God?
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.620]   Have I actually gazed upon his glory?
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:21.760]   To take some time to come before the Lord
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.480]   in honest confession, Lord, I don't think I know you.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.520]   Open my eyes, Lord, that I may behold your glory as well.
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:32.880]   If you happen to be somebody who grew up in the church,
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.820]   and you're so busy doing so many things,
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:37.720]   but only one thing is required of you,
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:40.660]   fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:43.740]   Fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.760]   Do you love this Jesus?
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.480]   You're laboring for Jesus, you're sacrificing for Jesus,
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.280]   you are working for Jesus, but do you love this Jesus?
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.300]   Maybe we also need to take a step back,
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:30:00.860]   and fix our eyes upon what it is that we worship,
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.060]   what it is that we have.
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:05.100]   Let's take some time to pray
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:08.180]   the same prayer that Paul prays,
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:10.960]   that with all knowledge, that we would have the strength,
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.480]   with all the saints, to comprehend the width,
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.160]   the length, the height, and the depth of the love of Christ.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.000]   Let's pray.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.320]   (soft piano music)
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.240]   (soft piano music)
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.160]   (soft piano music)
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:35.080]   (soft piano music)
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:38.000]   (soft piano music)
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.920]   (soft piano music)
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:47.840]   (soft piano music)
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:54.760]   (soft piano music)
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:31:00.320]   (soft piano music)
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.400]   (soft piano music)
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:17.320]   (soft piano music)
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:25.160]   (soft piano music)
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:32.000]   (soft piano music)
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.920]   (soft piano music)
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:48.240]   (soft piano music)
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.880]   Church family, let's all rise together
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.440]   as we sing this closing praise.

[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.240]   Psalm 121.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:15.440]   I will lift up my eyes to the mountains
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.800]   from where shall my help come?
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.200]   My help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.640]   He will not allow your foot to slip.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.400]   He who keeps you will not slumber.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.040]   Behold, he who keeps Israel
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.780]   will neither slumber nor sleep.
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:30.840]   The Lord is your keeper,
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.800]   the Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.100]   The sun will not smite you by day nor the moon by night.
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.120]   The Lord will protect you from all evil.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.100]   He will keep your soul.
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.640]   The Lord will guard your going and out,
