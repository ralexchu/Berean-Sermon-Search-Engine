[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   "The servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.860]   which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning his Son,
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.540]   who was descended from David according to the flesh, and was declared to be the Son
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.020]   of God in power according to the spirit of holiness, by his resurrection from the dead,
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.560]   Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.320]   the obedience of faith, for the sake of his name among all the nations, including you,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.960]   who are called to belong to Jesus Christ, to all those in Rome who are loved by God
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.640]   and are called to be saints.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.000]   Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.640]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.540]   We thank you, Lord God, for our lives.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.280]   We thank you for our salvation, our family, our jobs, all that we have, Lord God, because
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.260]   of your blessing.
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.480]   Help us, Lord, to have right mind and right heart that we may worship you, Father God,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.360]   in sincerity.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.040]   We pray for your anointing, Lord God, that we would have ears to hear, hearts, Lord God,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.400]   to understand and will to apply all that you have for us.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.080]   I pray, Lord God, that the study of the book of Romans would really have the effect that
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.400]   your Holy Spirit had intended, that you would renew us, revive us, cause us to commit and
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.920]   love you, Father God, in spirit and in truth.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.520]   So we ask for your blessing over this time.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.640]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.500]   Amen.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.900]   You know, this week I was able to have fellowship with my old roommates back in college when
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.680]   I was part of a Little Spark ministry, and we kind of lived together for about three
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.320]   to four years.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.880]   And they're all, most of them are missionaries, so they're out of the country.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.620]   And so it was the first time in ten years that all of us were in one place.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.280]   So it's typically one would come in and the other one would not be there.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.960]   So we've had meetings throughout the years, like, you know, two of us or three of us.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.840]   It was the first time where all of us got together and was able to have fellowship.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.960]   It was a great time of encouragement.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.100]   But every one of those guys, with the exception of one, they were all ten, eleven years older
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.720]   than I was when I was younger.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.120]   So I remember when I was back in college, they would talk about things that I had no
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.280]   idea what they were talking about.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.800]   You know, they were ten years older, so they were talking about their parents retiring
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.520]   and how they're going to take care of them.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.160]   And obviously my parents were not at that stage yet.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.880]   And so I always felt a little bit, you know, out of place.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.040]   And then it was a reminder, you know, yes, that this Monday when we got together and
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.560]   we're talking, and I was, the topic of the conversation was Alzheimer.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.160]   You know, they were talking about how you should eat curry because, you know, that prevents
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160]   Alzheimer.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.520]   And I was thinking, you know, I'm not quite at that stage yet, but they're at the end
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.720]   of, you know, later 50s and they're hitting their 60s.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.880]   And they're not there yet, but they're, the things that they were talking about, obviously,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.820]   you know, was a little bit above, above me.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.120]   But it was interesting as we were talking about that and how, you know, that issue is
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.500]   very real because some of their parents already have, have dementia setting in.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.040]   And maybe some of your parents or grandparents have experienced that.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.640]   But the idea of losing your memory, somebody that you knew all your life and all of a sudden
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.840]   they don't remember you or they don't even remember themselves and how heartbreaking
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   that must be.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   And, you know, our ability to be able to understand who we are and be able to recognize our surrounding
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   because that's our life.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   That's how we function.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.440]   You know, our, basically our life is an accumulation of the things that we've experienced and that's
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.240]   made you who you are.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.320]   And then the way you relate to people who's around you.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.760]   So your identity is extremely important for our life.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.980]   It's at the core of who we are.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.720]   As Christians, again, it's extremely important for us to recognize and understand who we
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.800]   are in our identity because the moment we forget that, we begin to drift out into what
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.280]   the rest of the world is, you know, because we're social beings.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.340]   So we have a tendency that whoever we're surrounded with, whatever social environments that we're
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.640]   surrounded with, we have a tendency to just kind of adapt and adopt to that.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.320]   When we're maybe younger in college and we're surrounded by Christian friends 24/7, we may
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.360]   just kind of go along with the flow and then our identity is solidified by the campus ministry
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.240]   or the church or events or small groups that we belong to.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.000]   But once you graduate college and your identity is very difficult to find in the world.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.900]   In fact, our identity is completely contrary and opposite of what we see around us.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.320]   So the moment that we forget who we are, we naturally drift to become what the rest of
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.440]   the world is.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.460]   I say all of this is because the passage that we're looking at, Paul is introducing himself
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.560]   to the Roman church.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.720]   And before he gets to the heart of the message and he's going into what we talked about last
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.520]   week where he's going through systematically through the gospel, he introduces himself
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.160]   because he's never been at this church and he's saying, "Before I speak, I want you to
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.240]   know this is who I am."
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.960]   So this morning, we're going to be unpacking three things that he says of his identity
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.600]   and take some time to study and look into that.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.560]   And what does that say about us?
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.120]   So the first thing that we see is Paul's identity in relation to Christ.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.680]   Paul's identity in relation to Christ.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.400]   Secondly, Paul's identity in relation to the world.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   Again, it's Paul's identity in relation to the world.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.000]   Third, Paul's identity in relation to his work.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.040]   So one, Paul's identity in relation to Christ.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.280]   Two, Paul's identity in relation to the world.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.400]   Third, Paul's identity in relation to his work.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.000]   So the first thing that we want to look at is the most all-encompassing.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.400]   And this isn't unique to Paul, but he begins his letter by saying, "Paul, a servant of
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.680]   Christ Jesus."
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.080]   In the Bible, the word "servant," there's two main words.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.320]   Now there are more than two words that are described, can be translated for "servant,"
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.560]   but there's two main words that are described or translated for "servant."
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.740]   And the first word is the word "diakonos," where we get the word "deacon."
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.800]   And that word basically means to serve, somebody who's serving the table, somebody who's serving
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.200]   to help other people.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.800]   But the word that Paul chooses to use here is not the word "diakonos," but the word "doulos."
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.560]   And I know our college students, we have a doulos, you know, and we use the word "servant."
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.520]   But the word "doulos" has a different connotation than the word "diakonos," because "diakonos"
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.360]   is, again, somebody who chooses to serve, but he's not bound by his service.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   He chooses to do so.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.040]   But the word "doulos" literally means someone who is bound in service.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.720]   That's the word that Paul uses here.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.480]   Every time we use the term "doulos" or "servant," again, in more literal translations, they
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.880]   may say the word "slave."
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.400]   And I think because the history of, you know, modern history in the last 100, 150 years,
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.520]   the term "slavery" was such an evil institution, I think the modern translators deliberately
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.320]   stayed away from that word, "slave," and they translated the word into "bond servant" or
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   "servant."
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.000]   So that word basically means "slave."
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.360]   But we also have to understand that at that particular time, the institution of slavery
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.800]   was not exactly what you and I know of slavery from watching movies or reading history books.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.200]   In fact, at that particular time in Roman history, they figured that up to a third of
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.520]   the Roman population would have been considered a bond servant, a slave.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.060]   A third.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.460]   It was part of their economy.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.900]   Many of these bond servants became bond servants because Rome ended up conquering their nation.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.520]   And in order to, again, as a result of conquering their nation, a lot of their soldiers, maybe
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.140]   possibly their families, became bond servants as a result of that.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.480]   But many of these bond servants were voluntary bond servants for economic reasons.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.880]   Just like, you know, I guess the most equivalent way for us to look at some of these people
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.960]   is when you choose to go get a job and you get paid from 9 to 5, for 9 to 5 you are a
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.140]   slave of that company.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.780]   You are a bond servant of that company because they purchased you for that period.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.640]   You can't go there and be on Facebook for 10 hours a day.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.440]   You're being paid to do a certain job for a period.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.200]   Obviously you come home and during that time is your own time, but during a period that
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.760]   you've been contracted, they own you.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.800]   In a sense.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.320]   Well that's the term that Paul uses here as a bond servant, that he voluntarily has become
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.460]   a servant of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.040]   Now the term that Paul uses here is not just encompassing of Paul.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.160]   In fact that word is described as Christians generally, that all of us, first and foremost,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.720]   are bond servants of Jesus Christ, that we belong to him.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:18.800]   Paul's first identity as a Christian is that he has been crucified with Christ.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.600]   Galatians 2.20 it says, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.320]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.480]   As a Christian, our first identity is death.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.960]   That's why when we talk about baptism, the beginning of Christianity is to identify that
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.880]   when Christ was crucified and was buried, that we were also crucified with him and buried
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.320]   with him.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.140]   The moment that we forget our identity in Christ is where we begin to get into trouble.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.440]   Our natural instinct as human beings is wanting to live.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.400]   So if you see something dangerous, you stay away from it.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   You don't calculate and say, "You know what?
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.120]   If I go over here and there's a dangerous cliff and there's no railing, you stay away
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   from that."
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.120]   If you don't know how to swim, stay away from the body of water.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.080]   If you go to certain areas, there's wild animals and you may get mauled.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.760]   You don't go to that place or you protect yourself.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.400]   Our natural instinct is to live.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:30.360]   But the paradox of Christianity is that Christ says, "In order to live, you must first die."
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.780]   And that's why he says, "If you want to come after me, you must first pick up your cross
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.160]   as well and come to me to the cross."
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:45.880]   How much of our frustration as Christians is directly linked to the idea that we are
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.560]   trying to find life outside of Christ?
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.240]   How much of the worldly thinking that's penetrated into our way of life, living, our principles,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.120]   that is in direct contradiction to who we are in Christ, that is causing this anxiousness,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.680]   this frustration, relational issues?
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.800]   Paul says again in Galatians 6, 14, "Far be it from me to boast except in the cross
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:19.400]   of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world."
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.680]   Not only has Paul been crucified, he said, "The world itself has been crucified.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.200]   It's dead to me.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:33.560]   There is nothing in the world that I desire to pursue because I don't find life in that."
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.000]   Again, Colossians 3, 3-4, "For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   God.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.360]   When Christ, who is your life, appears, when you also will appear with Him in glory."
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.480]   He's not simply saying if you want to be a Christian, you want to be a follower of Jesus
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.120]   Christ, you must forsake all that makes you happy.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.960]   All the pleasures and all the things that everybody else pursues.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   And if you're a Christian, you have to be a monk.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.880]   You can't enjoy what everybody else enjoys.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.280]   And you just have to live one frustrated life.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.800]   That's not what God is saying.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.960]   What Paul says in Colossians 3, 3-4 is an echo of what Christ said repeatedly over and
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.440]   over and over again.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.040]   "He who finds his life shall lose it.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.640]   And he who loses his life for my sake, he shall find it."
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.480]   That is Christianity 101.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.120]   That is not Christianity for pastors.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.320]   That is not Christianity for missionaries.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.560]   That's Christianity 101.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.200]   The first day that you become a Christian, we identify with His death.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.240]   That we no longer exist.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.560]   In fact, I would say of all the verses that I've meditated and repeated in my mind over
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.800]   and over again, Galatians 2-20 is the one that I have to repeat to myself over and over
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.600]   and over and over again.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.840]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.080]   It is no longer I who live.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.520]   I don't know how many times I have to kind of take a step back because somebody has offended
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520]   me.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.600]   And something in me rises up and says, "Why?
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.600]   Why would they do that?"
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   You know?
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.680]   Or I feel cheated and it's like, "Why?
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.440]   This is not fair."
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.800]   And my natural instinct is to retaliate.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.360]   My natural instinct is like anybody else.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:24.600]   And then I have to take a step back and think to myself, "Peter, are you really crucified?
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.320]   Are you really not living?"
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   Even in my marriage.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.080]   You know, we get into conflicts and get frustrated, especially in the beginning parts of the marriage.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.280]   I don't know how many times I have to recite that to myself.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.040]   It's like, "Well, you know, Esther doesn't deserve this.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.640]   Why do I have to go to her again?"
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.400]   And I have to take a step back and say, "Peter, are you really crucified?"
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.600]   How much of our frustration, even with our children, because they do things that are
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.200]   offensive and so selfish.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   "Why?
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Why are you doing this?"
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.800]   So much of what rises up is our own life, is our own desire.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:11.240]   And if you look at scripture, it is this desire to be somebody, to be significant, to have
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.160]   better things, to be comfortable.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.600]   Seeking life in this world is what's killing us.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.300]   It's what's causing frustration.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.360]   And if it gets bad enough, this is what causes war.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.120]   Every single one of us, when the scripture says, "All have sinned and fall short of the
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.540]   glory of God," because we've fallen short of God's glory, we are seeking our own glory.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.200]   And it is our pursuit of our own glory that is killing us, that is dividing us, that is
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   frustrating us.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.560]   That's why Jesus says, "No, first, you must die with me.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.000]   Come die with me first, if you really want to live.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.320]   Die with me to yourself.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.000]   Die with me to the world.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.440]   Die with me to your passions.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.480]   Die with me to your pride.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.440]   Come die with me, that you may truly live in a new resurrected life."
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.760]   And that's why the scripture tells us first and foremost that until a life is fully surrendered
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.280]   to God as a bond servant of Jesus Christ, you cannot live.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.580]   No amount of church attendance, no amount of Bible reading, no amount of Bible memory
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:26.800]   and study can replace being dead in Christ.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.320]   Because life in Christ cannot be had if you skip the cross.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.240]   Remember Apostle Paul, when he met Jesus, you know, he thought he was doing the right
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.880]   thing and he was pursuing it through the law, through the religious system.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.680]   He was pursuing his own glory.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:49.640]   In fact, the way he described himself, he was a Jew among Jews, Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.000]   And he was willing to even murder.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.960]   And he was going out to Damascus with a whole army behind him and Jesus knocks him off the
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   horse.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.520]   And the way Paul described this encounter in Acts chapter 26, 14, he says, "Jesus spoke
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.280]   to him and said, 'Paul, Paul, why are you kicking against the goad?'"
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.880]   Now, in our generation, kicking against the goad doesn't have a lot of meaning behind
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.240]   it because we don't use goads.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.320]   I don't know, maybe some of you guys use goads.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   Okay.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   Maybe if you grew up in the farm, even if you grew up in the farm, I don't think you
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   use that anymore.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.360]   Basically, a goad was a stick with a sharp end and it was used to poke at the animal
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.960]   to control him.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.400]   So whether he's going left or right, maybe the cow is starting to veer right and he's
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.880]   going to fall off a cliff and the, you know, the farmer will poke him through that.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   And that was the goad.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.480]   The goad was the instrument that was used to direct the path of the horse or the cow.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:52.000]   So when Jesus described Apostle Paul's life, he says, "You are kicking against the goad,"
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   meaning I'm trying to direct you to the right path and you're resisting me.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.040]   And by resisting, basically you're kicking the goad.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.000]   The more the animal kicks against the goad, the more he hurts himself because he's kicking
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.040]   against a sharp object.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.960]   And this object was there for the purpose of directing and guiding.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:16.760]   When an individual goes against the will of God, he says, "We're kicking against the goad."
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.000]   So when Paul says, "I am first and foremost a bond servant who belongs to him," we all
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.060]   know the freedom.
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.400]   And that's the problem that you and I a lot of times get into because we talk about how
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.200]   we are free in Christ.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.320]   But you don't, a lot of times we don't understand.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.560]   We are free in Christ that we may be bound in Christ.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.920]   That's why the scripture says that we have been set free from the bondage of sin, that
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.480]   we may be bound to righteousness.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:51.520]   In order to be bound to righteousness, we have to be set free from unrighteousness.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.680]   But we get into this problem where we say, "We've been set free from sin so that I can
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.960]   do whatever I want."
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.160]   But this "whatever I want" ends up binding us to the very things that he set us free
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.360]   from.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.280]   So therefore, our first and most important identity in Christ is that every single one
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.160]   of us, we are doulos in Christ.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.280]   We're bound in Christ.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.000]   We are first dead in Christ.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.720]   It is no longer I who live.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.600]   It is not my passion.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:26.440]   How much of our frustration comes from trying to figure out, "What do I want?
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.440]   What is there for me?
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.280]   How come nobody loves me?
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.000]   How come nobody cares about me?"
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.560]   How much of the frustration and anxiousness is directly linked to our seeking our own
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.400]   life and our own glory?
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.480]   That's why the first calling for every Christian is to die in Christ.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.880]   And that's how Paul describes himself.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.960]   "I am dead in Christ.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.120]   I'm a bound servant.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.520]   I'm a bound servant of Jesus.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.680]   I belong to Him.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.640]   I am not independent of Him.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.720]   Anything that I'm going to say from this point on, it is not my words.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.760]   It is His, because I'm just a servant."
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:09.720]   Secondly, not only an identity to Christ, but His identity to the world.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.720]   He says, "I am a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle."
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.520]   We're all servants.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.480]   We're all bound in Christ, but we're all called differently.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.080]   Paul uses that term "apostle" in almost every letter he writes.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.120]   The term "apostle" basically means, in the general sense, a messenger, somebody who's
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.120]   been sent.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.120]   But Paul uses it more specifically than that.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.400]   In Ephesians chapter 2, 19-20, he says, "The household of God," meaning the church, "was
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.880]   built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, as Christ Jesus Himself being
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   the cornerstone."
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:55.680]   Meaning, that office of apostleship was specific to a certain group of people, like the prophets,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.520]   that everything else that you and I know of was built on top of that.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.240]   So Paul wasn't using it in a generic sense.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.920]   He was using it in a specific sense, that He was a man who was specifically called for
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.920]   that purpose.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.320]   Now, obviously, he starts out by saying, "I'm a bound servant of Jesus Christ, called as
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.480]   an apostle."
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.820]   You may look at that and say, "Well, Paul is humbling himself and elevating himself
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.480]   at the same time."
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.720]   In essence, he is doing that.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.200]   And the reason why he does that in his letters is because the people who are receiving this
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:32.480]   letter need to understand that everything that he says comes with, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.640]   Now, you may be sitting there evaluating, it's like, "Oh, let's see if this guy has
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.120]   anything good to say."
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.440]   Whatever good or bad thing that comes out of my mouth, if it has any authority, it is
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.920]   because it is basically a reflection of what is being taught in the Scripture.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.120]   There is no authority in my life experience.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.400]   It's just my life experience.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.000]   And you may have different experiences in life.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.740]   There's no authority in that.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.060]   Maybe some people's, other people's opinions are better than other people's opinions.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.560]   But in the end, there is no absolute authority.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.020]   Authority comes from His Word.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:14.380]   So in one sense, Paul is saying that he is an apostle of Jesus Christ because he's speaking
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.380]   with authority.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.820]   Now, you may automatically think, "Well, there's honor and glory that comes along with
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.820]   that."
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:26.660]   And again, the church has gone into so many problems because people are pursuing glory
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.440]   in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.960]   But that is the farthest from the case with Apostle Paul.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.840]   You have to remember.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.340]   You have to remember.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:41.140]   Paul, not only was an apostle, but he says it repeatedly in the New Testament that he
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.500]   was an apostle specifically for the Gentiles.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.460]   Now you remember who he is.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.180]   He says he's, to the law, he was perfect.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.500]   Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.120]   If he's a man who was perfect to the law, the law, basically, one of the greatest things
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:08.080]   about keeping the law pure, or keeping the law perfectly, is that you could not be tainted.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   You could not be tainted.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.080]   You have to keep the law pure.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.460]   So by his desire, and the Pharisees' desire to stay pure, they wouldn't touch anything
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.220]   impure.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.420]   They couldn't eat what the Gentile.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.880]   They couldn't eat what they ate.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.400]   In fact, they took it even further than that.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.600]   Some of these Jews would not even enter a town where it was predominantly Gentile.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.720]   They would deliberately go around the city and spend an extra day traveling just so that
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.720]   they can stay pure.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:39.300]   Now that was not in the Scripture, but that's how far these Pharisees went.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:44.480]   If there was ever a job description saying, "Hey, we need an apostle to the Gentiles,"
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:50.200]   Apostle Paul would have been the last person to sign up for it.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.080]   Possibly maybe the best person to be an apostle to the Gentiles may have been a Gentile.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:02.560]   In fact, if you remember, Paul says that he loves his fellow countrymen so much that later
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.280]   on in Romans chapter 9, he actually says, "If it was up to me, I would be accursed myself
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.240]   that they may be saved."
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.080]   So we may think, who would have been, according to our logic, who would have been the best
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.120]   apostle to the Jews?
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.960]   Probably Paul.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.840]   Not some fisherman who's lived most of his life catching fish out far away from the
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.000]   temple.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.280]   But here's a man who's been working all of his life to get ahead in temple worship, and
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:37.880]   he was at the tip, almost already there.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.760]   But God says, "I've reserved him as an apostle to the Gentiles."
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.520]   In fact, we know that early on, Paul probably had issues with that.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:54.360]   Because all his life, he trained himself to hate the Gentiles.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.280]   So if you watch his ministry path, every city that he goes to, what's the first place that
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.120]   he goes to?
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.120]   Synagogue.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.880]   Almost exclusively, every city that he goes to, even when he's in a Gentile town, he would
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.920]   seek out a synagogue, and he would end up preaching the gospel there.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.720]   There's only two cities that we know where he wasn't able to go to the synagogue, which
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.520]   was at the city of Lystra, where he picks up Timothy, and the city of Philippi.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.080]   And the reason why is because there wasn't a synagogue.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.560]   But in every other city, the first place he goes to is a synagogue where the Jews hung
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.800]   out to worship God.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.040]   And it wasn't until he got kicked out of the synagogue, he would end up going to the marketplace
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.880]   and start preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.680]   So Apostle Paul, if we look at it, he was probably the worst person to pick.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.480]   And yet, God called him to be an apostle to the Gentiles.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:52.640]   That's just like God wanting to bring the gospel to the Jews, and then said, "Who's
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.880]   the best person that I can raise up as a prophet to go take the gospel to the Jews?"
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:03.200]   And then, instead of going to the Jews, instead of going to Israel, and looking at the most
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:10.160]   religious, most studied, most accomplished person in Israel, go to the Palestine.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.600]   You know, they hate each other, and they can't stand each other, and live generations hoping
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.680]   that each other would just disappear.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:23.480]   And they pick a leader among the Palestinians, and equips him, and then sends him over.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.800]   That's basically what happened to Paul.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:33.640]   See, his apostleship, even though he introduces himself as an apostle, even the very title
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.000]   "apostle to the Gentiles" reflects his due loss.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.160]   It wasn't his choice.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.280]   He didn't choose this.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.500]   God chose him.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.720]   And the way he describes his choice is in 1 Timothy 1, 15-17.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.360]   The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:58.400]   the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.360]   I know a lot of Christians use this to talk about, like, "Yeah, I'm the worst Christian."
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.720]   And sometimes I hear false humility when people use this, because I don't think you really
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.760]   believe that.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   Because I don't believe it.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.880]   I'm a sinner, but I'm not the worst.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   Because I know some people that are worse than me.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.600]   I know a lot of people.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.720]   Unless you really believe it.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.520]   But I think most people who use that don't really believe that.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.800]   And I think, look at Apostle Paul.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.120]   Here's an apostle who's giving his life to spread the gospel.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.600]   Could he possibly be the foremost sinner at the time?
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.240]   Maybe.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.320]   Maybe that was his perspective.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   But I think, when you consider who he was, he really was the foremost.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.880]   This is a guy who actually tried to kill Christians.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.400]   Who actually committed to stop the spread of the gospel.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.680]   He would have been the worst person to choose.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:03.000]   Why would you choose a man who actually committed murder to stop the spread of the gospel?
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.280]   He hated Jesus so much that he was willing to die.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.880]   Why would God choose this foremost of sinners, the worst of sinners, in light of the gospel?
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:21.700]   He says this, "But I receive mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.680]   Christ might display His perfect patience as an example to those who are to believe
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.800]   in Him for eternal life."
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.120]   He was the perfect person because He was the worst.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:41.480]   He was the perfect person to shine the gospel because every time He opened His mouth, it
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   reflected.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   If God can save that guy, if He can get that guy, a leader of the Palestinians, to come
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.080]   over here and spread the gospel of love to these Jews.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:59.840]   If He can save that man from that darkness into this light, then we have hope.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:05.920]   How often do we refuse a calling of God because we don't feel like we fit that mold?
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.280]   What God is looking for is articulate people.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.680]   What God is looking for is talented people.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.040]   What God is looking for is smart people.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.960]   But when we search the scriptures, God seeks completely the opposite.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.040]   When Moses said, "I don't have the gift of speaking," did Jesus say, did God say, "You
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.920]   humble man?"
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.280]   No.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.880]   He rebuked him.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.200]   He rebuked him for being arrogant, for refusing Him.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.640]   "Do you think I called you because I need you?
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.560]   I'm going to display my power, not your power.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.280]   I'm going to display my power."
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.960]   And that's why Paul says, "It is when I am weak, He is strong."
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:56.920]   How much of our life is frustrated because we are committed to be strong?
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.840]   We're committed to be wise.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.320]   We're committed to be something.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:08.200]   And yet everything about our identity tells us, "First be crucified.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.640]   Lose your life in Christ that we may be found."
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.760]   Third and final identity is his identity to his work.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.040]   Paul was very clear who he was in Christ.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.480]   Paul was very clear in who he was to the world.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.040]   He was a messenger of God to be sent to these Gentiles.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.400]   He learned to love them.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.960]   He didn't, God didn't choose him because He loved the Gentiles.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   God chose him because He hated the Gentiles.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.720]   He learned to love them because He obeyed.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.760]   And he began to preach the Gospel.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   That you and I have been called to be ambassadors.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.120]   Not because you're articulate, not because you have the most knowledge, because God wants
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.640]   to display His glory.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.040]   You know, this room is filled with people with awesome testimonies.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:30:00.360]   It is a tragedy in the church where you only hear one person, the person up in the pulpit.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.160]   We have to be in the habit of sharing our testimonies.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.040]   Not only in the church, but outside the church.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.520]   To tell the people what God has done.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.160]   Because God didn't just call me to be an ambassador.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.720]   God called every single one of us.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.240]   Every single one of you who have seen the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.720]   You are ambassadors to the people who are around you.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:31.800]   Third and final is Paul's identity to his work.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:38.280]   Every Christian needs to be an expert of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.400]   I know, you know, we have, this room represents a lot of different fields.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:49.360]   Whether you are going into, you know, electronics or computers or medical field or legal field.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.360]   Everybody is going into different fields.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.080]   Everybody begins the same way, but you would expect after 4 or 5 years of training, maybe
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.480]   4 or 5 years of working, that you are an expert in that particular field.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.400]   So if I had some legal questions, I would go to a lawyer.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.600]   If I had some medical questions, I would go to a doctor.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.120]   If I had some computer questions, I would go to some of the Apple freaks.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.120]   Right?
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.320]   I would go and ask you guys about what to do.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   Right?
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.160]   But everybody becomes an expert the longer you spend in that particular field, you become
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.880]   more and more of an expert in that particular field.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:33.120]   As Christians, every single one of us ought to be a growing expert in the Gospel of Jesus
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.840]   Christ.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.920]   Because there is nothing that you know that is more important than the Gospel of Jesus
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.600]   Christ.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.800]   All your learning in legal, in legal documents, all your learning in the medical, all your
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:53.080]   learning in business, in restaurants, all of these things pale in comparison to what
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.920]   you and I proclaim is at the center of who we are, which is the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:04.880]   It is a tragedy that you and I live in a generation where we have a handful of experts that we
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.160]   turn to every time we have a question.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.920]   But a common Christian is not expected to know.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.960]   And we just kind of bring them to the pastor, bring them to some of the elders.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   But this is something that you and I need to, Paul says that he has been set apart as
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.000]   an apostle, set apart for the Gospel of God.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Set apart.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.080]   The word set apart literally means to be holy.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:39.000]   In the Old Testament, when something became holy, it was a common article, it was a bowl,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.380]   and you just picked it up and said you dedicate it to the temple, to be used at the temple.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.520]   From that moment on, it became holy.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.960]   Because now that particular bowl, even though it was nothing here, has become something
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.720]   because it was dedicated to the Lord.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:01.160]   Paul uses the term as set apart, to be made holy for God's use.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.680]   Set apart for what?
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.720]   What have you and I been set apart for?
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.840]   Well, 1 Peter 2.9 makes it very clear.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:14.680]   "For you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His own possession,
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.800]   that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.880]   marvelous light."
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:27.040]   See, if we embrace that, okay, I'm crucified with Christ, you're no longer I who live.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.600]   And then we forget our identity to the world.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.360]   Imagine if we had a commissioning service, and I shared this again when Pastor Alex and
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.560]   his team was leaving out to, going out to China, I said, "You know, we have this great
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.920]   commissioning service, we're blessing them, we're praying for them, you know, and financially
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.600]   supporting them, we have commissioned them, and all of a sudden we go out to Dharminjamboree
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.480]   and they're sipping on boba.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.460]   You know, would you just give them a high five and say, 'Hey, how's that boba?
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.460]   Would you just come home?'"
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.460]   Right?
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.460]   You probably was like, "That's strange.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.960]   I thought we commissioned you.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.800]   What are you doing?"
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.160]   Like, that's what, maybe you won't say it, but I know you're going to be thinking it.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.480]   And then you're going to come home and say, "Didn't we commission that guy?
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.760]   Didn't we commission him to China?"
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   Like, why?
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   Why do you ask?
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.280]   "Because I saw him at Dharminjamboree.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.920]   You know, he's hanging out there."
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   It's like, "What?
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   When?"
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   "Today.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   Today.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.920]   He was out there today."
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:32.760]   That would be a very strange scene.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.320]   What's your commission to all of us?
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.880]   When he said, "Go make disciples of all the nations," that was not just for these people.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.600]   We've all been commissioned.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.240]   Now, we may not have been commissioned to China.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.440]   We may not have been commissioned to a particular place.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.960]   But we've all been commissioned as ambassadors.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.840]   So if you've been commissioned as a lawyer and you don't know the law, you can't be a
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   lawyer.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.480]   I don't care what kind of titles you have.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.040]   I don't care what kind of suit you wear.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.080]   If you don't know the law, you can't practice the law.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.840]   You can't be a lawyer.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:12.080]   If we're ambassadors for Christ and we don't understand and know the Gospel, you can't
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   practice Christianity.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.960]   Paul says, not only has he been set apart, he says, "This was promised beforehand through
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.760]   the prophets in the Holy Scriptures."
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.960]   This was not something new that Paul was bringing.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.440]   This message of the cross has been prepared from the beginning.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.960]   When he said, "The seed of the woman is going to come and crush the head of the serpent,"
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.600]   from the very beginning of the fall, he was waiting and preparing for his son to come.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:42.200]   So this Gospel message has been embedded to everything that we know in the Old Testament
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.440]   so when we come, when Jesus comes, we would recognize who he is.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:53.680]   So if it is this important, how important should it be to us that we not only understand
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.120]   it to be saved, but we understand it enough to be able to explain to other people?
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:02.720]   If you've been a Christian for three, four, five, six years, and somebody asks you a basic
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.960]   Christian question about Christianity, and you have to constantly, "Talk to my pastor,
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:13.240]   talk to my pastor," at some point, at some point we have to take a step back and say,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:19.760]   "Why am I not investing in the very thing that I consider to be the most important thing?"
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.000]   Every Christian, at some point, needs to be an expert, not just good, not just proficient,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.880]   but an expert of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:34.560]   So this Gospel concerning his son, who was descended from David according to the flesh,
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:40.400]   again, fulfillment of prophecy, all of this stated in the Old Testament, and he says it
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.520]   was fulfilled because Jesus was born in the flesh, and that's why the book of Matthew
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:51.640]   begins with this genealogy to show that Jesus is the fulfillment of all the promises that
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.720]   God made, that the seed of the woman is going to come.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:00.400]   That proves who he is, and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.880]   Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.960]   Paul not only was able to defend himself, his whole point of the book of Romans is so
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:17.120]   that you may be, you and I may be proficient in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.960]   Not just good, not just memorize a few scriptures, but to be experts, because this is who we
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   are.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:29.360]   Before we are a lawyer, before we are anything else, we are bond servants of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.760]   I remember, you know, right now it's just like Christian music, and there's a lot of
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:39.560]   things going on, but I remember when I was younger, there was no Christian pop artists,
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   you know?
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.320]   The quality of the music wasn't that great, so either, I mean, I thought Keith Green was
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.680]   great because of the message, but people make fun of me every time they listen to Keith
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.000]   Green, because it sounds like bar music.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   He actually used to be a musician in the bar who got saved.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.960]   But it was his message that was powerful, but there was no crossing.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.520]   There was no Christians who were popular in the secular field.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.560]   And then a few years down the line, the Christian music started to get popular, and then they
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.640]   started crossing over to the secular, and then they would come on secular talk shows.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.120]   And I'm not going to name who these people were.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.360]   But it was kind of a strange scene to see Christian artists on secular TV programs,
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.880]   and they're talking about their band, and all of a sudden, I remember being so disappointed
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.560]   because there was this particular band that I really liked listening to.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.140]   It was a Christian band.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:34.600]   And they asked the question, you know, "Are these, you know, you're a Christian who's
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:39.080]   singing praises to the Lord and all this stuff, but not all non-Christians are listening to
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.600]   it, and how do you feel about it?"
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.000]   And the way the front man described himself was, "Well, you know, I'm a musician first.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.360]   I'm a musician who happens to be Christian, so it's really relevant to everybody."
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.320]   And then he pointed to a particular song about worship toward God, and he said, "Well, is
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.440]   this toward God or is this toward some lover?"
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.960]   And he said, "I guess you can take it any way you want."
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.600]   Stopped listening to that guy, you know.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.240]   I was so discouraged by that.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:16.720]   The way he described it, "I'm a musician first who happens to be Christian."
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.240]   Absolutely false.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.120]   We are Christians who happen to be lawyers.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.160]   We are Christians who happen to be doctors.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.840]   We are Christians who happens to be computer scientists.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.600]   Is that the right term?
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   Computer science-ist?
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:38.280]   Okay.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:45.940]   Our first identity in him, right, as a bond servant, called to be an ambassador with a
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.040]   message of the cross, to declare His glory.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.480]   That's who we are.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:56.440]   Anytime we stray away from that, we stray away from the life that He promised, because
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.480]   that's where life is.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.600]   Life is at the center of Christ.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:07.800]   You know, I shared this before, but you know, the very first car that I bought, I, you know,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.520]   I share this, I'm going to share this again, because I think it's relevant.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.680]   1979, piece of junk Sri Lanka, I know you've heard that before, but when I brought that
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.160]   car home, I was so proud.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.120]   One, because I paid for it myself.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.440]   I worked at Carl's Jr.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.840]   At that time, the minimum wage was like $325 or something, $315, and I remember working
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:34.120]   from 5 to 11, 1130, and then I would have to bike home afterwards, and I did this, you
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:40.400]   know, 40 hours a week, and I saved up some money from that, and then I got fired.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.680]   I won't get into the reason why.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.960]   And I got another job cleaning toilets, you know, but that was, it paid me five bucks
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.520]   an hour, so it was like, yes, you know.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:56.520]   And then I saved up enough money, about $1,500, and I found this advertisement, and it was
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   way out in the valley.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.240]   I think I was living in Buena Park or Downey at the time, and then I found this myself,
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:07.200]   and I had a friend of mine drive me down to the valley, and I think I was like 18 years
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   old.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.760]   I was 18 years old, and I never got any help from my parents, and I drove down by myself,
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.800]   and then I gave him cash, you know, because I thought that's what you're supposed to do,
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.720]   so I bought all this cash, and then I gave it to him, and I asked him, like, "Okay, now
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.720]   what do I do?"
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.440]   So he was kind enough, he said, "Well, you've got to register the car."
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.440]   I was like, "What does that mean?"
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:31.240]   So he said, "Okay, you know, I'm going to have to take this dummy to the DMV."
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.880]   So he took me to DMV, and he went through the paperwork for me, and then we got it all,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.920]   you know, taken care of, and then I went and found insurance and got all the stuff in,
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.600]   and then I was just, you know, I was so happy.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.200]   I was driving, and then I came home, and the first thing I did was I cleaned the car, I
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   waxed it.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.760]   It was a piece of junk, but I waxed it, and then I said, "Okay, I'm going to put tint
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.760]   on it."
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   So I put tint on it.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.560]   Somebody told me that if you put tint in the driving side that you're going to get a ticket,
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.440]   so I tinted it, but I still wanted the tint, so I tinted it, and then I cut out the corner
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:10.320]   like that so that I can see, so I would, technically, I'm not illegal, and I put cheap-skinned car
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.280]   seat in it, you know what I mean?
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:17.680]   So it'd be smooth, and then, you know where the, what do you call it, the stick shift
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   where they pull it?
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.440]   I bought a new one, put a brand new one in there.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.160]   You know, every time my friends would come into the car, they're like afraid because
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:29.080]   the car is like rattling, and I couldn't put it in first gear first because something was
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   broken, so I'd always have to take it into second gear and then put it into second gear,
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.080]   first gear.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.560]   Parking brake never worked, so if I don't leave it in first gear and I forget, the car
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   would actually roll back.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.280]   So it was a piece of junk, you know?
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:50.160]   When I rode that car, I was so proud, and it's not because I was, you know, naive and
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.480]   I didn't know what that car looked like.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.560]   To me, that car represented independence.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.840]   I bought that car by myself.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.520]   I caught, I registered it myself, I got insurance by myself, and I cleaned it up.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:12.760]   So to me, prior to that car, the most precious thing I owned up to that point was a $50 guitar.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   That was it.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:19.000]   So this was the next most important, most expensive thing that I had, and I took care
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   of it.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.520]   Every time I drove that car, I felt proud.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.080]   I used to stick my head out with the music bumping, and you know what I mean?
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:31.560]   It may be pumping, you know, pumping along, but to me, it was precious because to me,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.320]   that represented, you know, a year of hard work, scrubbing toilets and, you know, getting
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.240]   fired from, you know, Carl's Jr. and finding the car by myself.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.840]   I was an adult in that car.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.880]   You know why I share this with you?
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:53.480]   Because the moment we forget who we are in Christ, we start to live like who we were
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.960]   before we met Christ.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:06.320]   How precious are we if He purchased us by His own Son?
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.660]   That was precious to me because that was everything I had into that car.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.640]   The Bible says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.400]   When He says the world, He's talking about you.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.920]   He's talking about me.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:26.420]   That first and foremost, our identity is someone who has been plucked from the condemnation
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.680]   of this world and made us His own.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.660]   That we would become bond-servant of this One who gave everything for us.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:41.600]   And then He equipped us to be apostles, to the small letter apostle, to be messengers,
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.600]   to this world with this precious message.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.920]   To go declare and to go declare His glory so that people may see who you are and say,
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:56.640]   what an awesome God you serve.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.960]   What an awesome, awesome God that you serve.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:04.920]   Can I come and see who He is?
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.080]   That is our identity.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.400]   That is the most important identity.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:19.280]   The moment that we stray from that even an inch, we are ruined.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:25.640]   That's why Paul begins this letter by not only identifying himself, by identifying himself,
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.880]   he's setting the foundation.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.840]   This is who we are.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.640]   This is who I am.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.480]   And this is why I live.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.880]   Again, as we continue to study through the Book of Romans, that you would not be passive
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:46.760]   listeners, that you would be active in equipping, that hopefully at the end of the study of
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.600]   the Book of Romans, you can say, I know the Gospel.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.560]   Not only know it mentally, but I know it.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.440]   That our identity in Christ may be clear.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:00.760]   Can you take a few minutes to join with me in prayer as I invite the praise team to come
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.960]   up?
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.280]   If there's anybody in this room who've been invited and you don't have a personal relationship
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:13.720]   with Jesus Christ, I ask you this morning to come before the Lord in just simple prayer.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.800]   Lord, I've never asked for forgiveness.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.400]   I've always heard, and I have Christians around me, and I'm intrigued, but I've never personally
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:24.000]   invited you as my Lord and Savior.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.160]   Would you take a few minutes to come before the Lord and pray?
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.680]   Maybe you're not exactly even sure.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.160]   Is He going to listen?
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:32.440]   But just be honest before God.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.680]   There's no religious things that you need to say.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.240]   There's no formula.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.880]   Just like you would talk to anybody else.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.920]   Just come before the Lord and say, Lord, if you're real, forgive me of my sins.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.840]   I'm a sinner.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.840]   Forgive me.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.960]   And I want this life that the Scripture promises.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.800]   And the Scripture says if you confess your sins, He is faithful and just to forgive you
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.080]   of all your unrighteousness.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.960]   That no matter what sin that you've brought into this room, maybe some of you guys are
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.000]   thinking you don't know what I've done.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.160]   You don't know my past.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.600]   You don't know what I struggle with.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.800]   I don't, but God does.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.280]   To come before Him, you can't fool God.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.920]   Come before Him and confess what He already sees.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.720]   And ask for forgiveness.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:24.460]   And if you pray that prayer and you desire help and you have some questions, come and
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.460]   ask us.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.460]   You can ask me, you can ask your friends.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:30.600]   But I invite you this morning to take some time to pray.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   For the rest of you, please, please pray for the world.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.840]   Pray for the non-Christians in this room.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.600]   Pray for the non-Christians in your life.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.200]   Pray for the non-Christians that live around us.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.520]   That we would not just say with our mouths who we are.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.240]   That that would be our very life.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:58.880]   I am a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called to be an ambassador with the precious message
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.560]   of the Gospel.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.680]   That that would be my confession this morning.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.040]   So let's take some time to pray before the Lord this morning as our praise team leads
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:07.360]   us.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.200]   (papers rustling)
