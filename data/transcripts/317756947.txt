[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   This is 19 to 27, and this is a passage many of you guys are familiar with, or at least
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.960]   sections of it you guys are familiar with.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:20.320]   It's Hebrews chapter 10, verses 19 to 27.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.760]   Now therefore, or therefore brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.960]   by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   veil that is his flesh, and since we have a great high priest over the house of God,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.280]   let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.040]   clean from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.200]   Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promises faithful.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.060]   And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.840]   own assembling together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.040]   the more as you see the day drawing near.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.840]   Let's pray together.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.960]   Father, we thank you for just giving us a little bit of a, just a day and a half to
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:40.800]   focus, to just reflect on our own walk, to reflect on your kindness and goodness, the
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.280]   power of your word, and tonight, the power of the corporate body.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.400]   I ask, Lord, that you would speak, that you would help us and enable us to figure out
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.760]   how to apply all the things that we learn.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.400]   Help us to draw strength from you and from one another, and would you, Lord, receive
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.280]   just a glory from the fruit that is born in our lives.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.560]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560]   Amen.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.440]   So, last night we talked about just the dangers of drifting, and like I said, that's not a
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.480]   comfortable topic to talk about, but like I said before, it is important for us to often
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.300]   kind of gauge, to see where our feet are.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.240]   And then earlier this morning we talked about just the importance of really studying through
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.440]   the word of God and to clinging to the word of God to discern truth.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.680]   And that's important because more and more in today's day and age, truth is becoming
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.280]   subjective, right?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.720]   I meet all kinds of people who are at churches who hold on to very strange values that are
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.800]   not coming from the Bible.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.600]   And when you cite the Bible, you're immediately labeled as a hypocrite, a Pharisee, a religious
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.160]   bigot.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.720]   But nonetheless, you and I are called to anchor down and see everything through the lens of
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.440]   Scripture.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.200]   Tonight is going to be a little bit lighter, easier, and more applicational so that we
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.520]   can learn how to do this effectively, long-term, and together with one another.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.800]   And I wanted to end with this passage.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.320]   So as you guys now know, I worked in Korea for six years.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   And for the latter three years, we had kids.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.760]   So you met them today.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.720]   They're objectively cute, I think, objectively.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.840]   And so it was very special when they were born.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.580]   We were in our eighth year of marriage.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.800]   But because they were twins and because I traveled so much, I had to bring my wife in
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.440]   January of 2015, and she didn't come back to Korea until September.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.120]   So for eight months, we were living on two different continents.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.280]   And I did visit her a few times, and I was here.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.840]   I landed on the day they were born.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.020]   So just the Lord timed it well, and I enjoyed that.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.720]   But every summer since then, 2015, summer '16, '17, my heart was ripped apart every time
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.080]   I had to go to LAX.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.200]   And it was just a very difficult, emotional, like, I am leaving my wife and my kids here,
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.520]   and I'm going back to Korea where I'm not going to see my kids two, three months.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.920]   But last summer, before we came here, oh, 2017 summer, the kids were about two and a
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.280]   half at that point.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.400]   And I picked them up from the airport, and we brought them into the house.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.760]   And they were familiar with the house because we had lived there before they left.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.660]   And as soon as my kids walked into the house, they were like, "Hee!"
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.080]   And then, you know, they were walking around.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.940]   They're opening up all the cupboards.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.640]   They were opening up the fridge.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.620]   They were opening up everything, taking out all the toys.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.600]   And I couldn't have been happier.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.720]   Because for me that home was not complete until the kids came in, and they made a mess
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.760]   within that first hour and a half.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:42.040]   But having them make themselves at home made me so happy, and I did not care that they
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.080]   were causing a ruckus.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.880]   I just enjoyed having them home, and I really enjoyed watching them open the fridge, close
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.840]   the fridge, open the fridge, close the fridge, open the fridge, close the fridge, open the
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   fridge, close the fridge.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.640]   So they just did that at two and a half.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.640]   And it really, for some reason, that just was so satisfying.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.840]   Oh, they're here.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.960]   They're home, and they know that this is their home.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.680]   Now if I invited you guys to our house, and you were opening the fridge, closing the fridge,
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.520]   opening the cupboards, closing the cupboards, and you were just making yourself at home,
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.200]   I kind of would be uncomfortable.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.880]   Same thing is if I went to your house or apartment, and I just started looking through all your
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:33.840]   stuff, checking out what you got in the fridge, just looking in all the rooms, you would feel
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.880]   uncomfortable because I am not a resident there.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.120]   I'm a guest.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.800]   If you came to my house, I would expect you to ask before you started.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.080]   If you wanted something in the fridge, like, "Can I have a Coke?"
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.800]   Or like, "If we're having ice cream, can I get some for myself?"
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   I'd be like, "Sure."
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.840]   I probably won't say no, but it's polite to ask.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.440]   My kids, if they asked, I would think that's weird.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.080]   So we live with my in-laws in a very big house.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.560]   I don't have to ask to see what we have to eat in the fridge.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.800]   It's my home also.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:26.240]   And my kids, they run around without any discomfort because it's their home also.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.720]   So they have confidence in living in this house.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.480]   And so for me, though my kids have to respect and honor me as their dad, they don't have
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.280]   to fear me in a terroristic way.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:47.320]   And if I saw that my kids were extra careful around me, I would feel bothered by it.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.400]   I'm like, "Is there a distance?"
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.960]   I want them to claim me as their dad.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.360]   So you know one of the things I love about Karis?
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.920]   She's a princess.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.320]   I don't know if you noticed, she actually put on the princess clothes and she told my
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.320]   wife, "I wanna go downstairs and to show everybody."
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.400]   So she was like...
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.600]   And she was begging for...
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.260]   She was fishing for your compliments.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.840]   And some of you guys did not oblige, I saw.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.000]   But one of the favorite things I love about my daughter is when she comes up to me and
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.880]   she goes, "Daddy, hold you."
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.160]   I don't know why she says it that way.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.360]   I'm like, "You want me to hold you?"
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.200]   So I think "hold you" became a pick me up.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.320]   So when she runs in front of me, stands in my way, say, "Hold you," right?
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   That's a demand.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.560]   I love it.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.400]   And my son loves books.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:49.000]   Every morning, if I'm home, he takes out four or five books and says, "Read.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.240]   Daddy read the book."
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.000]   And I try to read a couple.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.160]   I love it.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   Now if you guys were to run in front of me, "Buster, Peter, hold you."
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.420]   I'd be like, "No, thank you very much."
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:16.040]   If you were to ask me, "Read me a book," I would say, "Read it your stinking self."
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.560]   Even if my kids, they're starting to kind of pick out words, but even if they could
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:27.240]   read, I would still want to read to them.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.920]   When I was working in Korea, I have had the opportunity to work with just a good number
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.020]   of celebrities.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.060]   And because I was a pastor and I was a pastor at Compassion, they treated me very well and
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.480]   then treated me with a lot of respect as a pastor.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.800]   If one of them owned a restaurant, they invited me to come.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.520]   And so he and his wife, we had a little double date.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.720]   He fed me all kinds of stuff.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:00.140]   So whenever I was with our celebrities, I would feel uncomfortable a little bit because
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:08.460]   I felt like it's not royalty, but I feel like I'm sitting here in the presence of someone
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.800]   who is someone.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.720]   And it was uncomfortable for me.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:22.420]   I visited the home of one of them and everything I touched, everything I looked at, I was like,
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.700]   like I was very careful.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.540]   I didn't take out my phone to take any pictures.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.300]   And I felt very uneasy.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.060]   If I were to visit one of your homes, I wouldn't feel that way.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.540]   Not to say that you're not special.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:49.020]   But humanly speaking, when you are in the home of someone who is someone, a degree of
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.820]   composure comes into you.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.060]   Would you guys agree with that?
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:04.300]   The one -- but that celebrity, his daughter, I saw her run out and jump into his arms and
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.740]   inadvertently knee him in the groin.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.080]   And he was like, oh!
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.540]   And I was like -- and he was just laughing.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.740]   Although inside he was probably in pain.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:23.740]   But that was a familiarity that I did not have clearly because I was a guest and not
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.200]   family.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:35.980]   When you and I approach God, we are in the presence of the someone of someone's.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.540]   Does this make sense?
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:48.460]   So when you're coming into the house of God, in your heart, if you are an outsider, you
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:55.180]   need to handle everything with reverence and care.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:03.260]   But with the arrival of Christ, with the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, this is
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.300]   your house.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:14.100]   And though the God who is your Father is a someone and is the someone of someone's,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.620]   you can approach Him with complete confidence.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.220]   And you could say, hold you!
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.220]   Read me a book!
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:31.500]   And you could make demands out of that person because there is a love relationship.
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.660]   Your daddy is a king of kings and a lord of lords.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:41.140]   He is God, yet he's your daddy.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.860]   And that's a very strange thought to have.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.180]   Is it not?
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.180]   Every now and then I wonder what it would be like to be like Kobe Bryant's daughter
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.420]   or LeBron James' son.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.340]   I was about to say Donald Trump, but no, thank you very much.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:00.140]   Like who's a cool person?
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.860]   I don't know.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:08.060]   Like do you ever wonder what it would feel like to be a famous person's child or a Bill
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.400]   Gates' son?
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:17.140]   You would enjoy a relationship with that person that no one else would.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:26.220]   And to you, even though you know that that person is a person of significance, it's dad
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.340]   or mom.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:37.020]   Here in Hebrews 10, the author of Hebrews is actually describing this new relationship
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.640]   that we have, and it's very unique.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.640]   It's very strange.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:49.180]   19 to 22, "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.060]   the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the veil
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:01.900]   that is his flesh, and since we have a great high priest over the house of God."
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:07.680]   So the writer of Hebrews has just written about how the Levitical sacrifices could never
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.420]   do away with sin.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.060]   Human priests could never take away their sin.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.300]   And we just finished the study of Leviticus before Colossians.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.860]   Chapter 4 and 5 is all about sin offerings.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.260]   There's grain burnt, peace offering, guilt offering, sin offering, and they were constantly
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.980]   having to slay these animals.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:33.340]   And in Hebrews 10, verse 4, it's impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.340]   sin.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.980]   And then it goes on, "And every priest has to stand there daily offering again and again
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.260]   and again and again these sacrifices."
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:49.180]   But verse 14, "But by one offering, Jesus has perfected."
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.220]   What's the word perfected mean?
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:15:00.500]   Literally, made perfect, perfect, "for all time those who are sanctified."
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.100]   All of this is done.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.860]   Verse 18, "Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.580]   for sin."
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:16.900]   So there is no sin legally standing between you and God now.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.860]   You are a child and you can come and demand to be held.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.620]   You have confidence in a way that no outsider could.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:35.760]   And that veil, when it was torn, basically it was a visible, symbolic reminder now that
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.620]   this division between God and man has now been broken.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:50.300]   You are a child of God and you have every legal right to enjoy life of a prince.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:58.180]   And let me paint you like a little picture of this.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.420]   I went into Korea, the airport, a lot.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.780]   And I had a resident visa.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.500]   And as an ethnic Korean, I could actually stand in the Korean line.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.180]   And Koreans, everything's "palli palli," which means everything's hurried up.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.180]   Korean airport is super efficient.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.540]   How many of you guys have ever been to Incheon?
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.400]   Do you guys understand how efficient it is?
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   Super efficient.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.300]   One time, I got off the plane and into a taxi in 19 minutes.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.560]   And customs.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.160]   And because I have this special visa, I didn't have to stand in the foreigner's line.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.860]   And that helped because I was at that airport 20 times a year.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.020]   So, I could just walk into the line.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.020]   I'm gone.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.020]   I'm in.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.020]   Okay?
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.020]   That was all set up.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.620]   When I came to America, I actually had a thing which is called global entry.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.020]   Which basically, all of my records are in the US system.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:00.660]   So, if I ever come through a US port, I just scan my face and I'm good.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.780]   It used to help in LAX before they updated everything.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.940]   Now everything's fast.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.140]   So actually, the global entry is useless in LAX.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:21.340]   But in Uganda, where I was not a citizen, I got stuck at the port.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:30.660]   Because the person who was looking at my passport said, "Are you from China or Korea?"
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.060]   I said, "I'm from America."
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.580]   He's like, "No, you're not."
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.940]   And I was like, "I don't know what to tell you.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:45.420]   I don't know how to explain to you that I'm not from Korea or China."
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.420]   He said, "What are you?
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.420]   Japanese?"
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.420]   I said, "No."
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.420]   I said, "Look at my passport.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.420]   What does it say?"
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.420]   He goes, "You're not an American."
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.860]   So, it took a few minutes before his supervisor came and said, "He is an American.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.860]   Just let him go.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.860]   Otherwise, you couldn't have gotten a passport."
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.720]   So, it was a hassle.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.940]   And everything at that trip in Uganda was a hassle.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.780]   Because it was not a place for me.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:20.260]   When you are in a right standing before just a legal -- what do you call that?
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.260]   Like not judge.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.700]   The country, the immigration.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:33.200]   When you are in fine, proper standing, everything moves easily.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   There are no obstacles.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:41.240]   But when you're an outsider, you have to go through all kinds of hoops and inconveniences.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:51.120]   Before, to get to God, every person had to go through all kinds of trouble to feel like
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.080]   there is some peace between God and man.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.880]   But with Jesus, all of that was done.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:07.040]   So, I don't know -- you're going to have to take time to mull over this.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.980]   But you are a child of God.
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:20.220]   You are a delight to the heavenly Father as a child of God.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:27.800]   And Jesus, your high priest, intercedes now on your behalf.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:38.300]   And when Jesus prays, when the Holy Spirit prays, you cannot go against it.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:47.400]   And this Jesus is interceding for your well-being.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:58.380]   He is praying on your behalf for you to be sanctified into His likeness.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.540]   And nothing is going to stop that from happening.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.500]   The Holy Spirit of God is praying for you.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.900]   Is that a biblical teaching?
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:14.440]   Yeah, He's praying for you with groans that words cannot express.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:21.740]   So you have absolute confidence before God.
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:29.000]   But when you are engaged or entangled in some sin, it's not that God moved away.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.020]   You just feel super bad and sometimes laden with guilt.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:40.700]   And you kind of get entangled and you have a hard time focusing and worshiping.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:48.100]   Here it says, "Brethren, we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.500]   by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is His flesh.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.160]   And we have a great high priest over the house of God.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.780]   So all of these things are now the benefits that you have.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.160]   So let us."
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.900]   And there are three "let us's" that he describes.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:12.860]   There are three broad "let us" statements with participles connected to it.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:20.840]   The first one is, verse 22, "Let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:29.180]   faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.180]   pure water."
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:38.580]   "Let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:45.640]   sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.340]   When you examine yourselves to see whether you are of the faith and you realize indeed
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:22:02.060]   that Christ Jesus is in you, you can approach God fully assured of your faith and He will
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:13.700]   start washing away anything of a tainted conscience and He will present you as a glorious bride.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:21.180]   This section, Hebrews 10.22, is very similarly worded to Ephesians 5.26, "Husbands, love
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.260]   your wives as Christ loved the church," right?
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.200]   And washing her with pure water through the word.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:32.400]   And we looked at this week in Colossians chapter 1, verse 22, to present you holy and blameless
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.240]   and beyond reproach.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.920]   You are already clean if you are a child of God.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   So it's just a matter of growing to appreciate it, growing to be free in it, and growing
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.600]   to enjoy and delight in this confidence that we have in approaching God.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:01.980]   The second, "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.480]   is faithful."
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:09.880]   Does our faith and our walk with God depend on our efforts, our goodness, our spiritual
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.920]   gifts or does it depend on Christ's faithfulness?
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.620]   Our walk with God does not depend on our effort.
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:32.200]   It depends all on Christ's faithfulness and that is how a true saint of God really can,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:39.640]   without wavering, hold fast, even in times of difficulty.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.960]   And those are things that I encourage you guys to kind of think through.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:51.920]   Hey, I am a child of God and I'm not perfect by any means, but I can approach God with
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:59.480]   absolute just freedom and delight and knowing that I'm accepted, that he loves me just as
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.000]   I am.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.520]   But because of the spiritual DNA that's in me, he's changing me.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:09.560]   So give me enough time, I'm going to look, feel, smell, and sound like Jesus.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.900]   That's going to happen one day.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:17.440]   It's absolutely going to happen one day because he is the one doing all this.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:25.880]   And for me, it's not a matter of like, am I going to fall away or am I going to like
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.360]   become the next like spiritual giant?
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:35.440]   What it is, is am I going to just really enjoy being a child of God?
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.720]   And I want to focus mostly on verse 25.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:45.520]   Or verse 24 and 25.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:53.440]   And let us consider how to stimulate one another to loving good deeds.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.160]   Not forsaking our own assembling together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:06.280]   another and all the more as you see the day drawing near.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.080]   And verse 24 and 25, you guys have probably heard before, right?
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.360]   Let us consider how to stimulate one another to loving good deeds.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.160]   And there are participles attached to it.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.280]   Okay, but I want to pause here.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.960]   What does it mean to stimulate or stir up one another?
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:29.680]   How do I encourage you to love somebody?
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.440]   How do I encourage you to do good works?
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:42.760]   First of all, it does not mean to compel or force.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:52.080]   Stimulating someone to loving good deeds is not under compulsion or by force.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:26:00.300]   So when you feel like you need to rebuke somebody in love, and some of you guys are more gifted
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.960]   than others in rebuking somebody in love.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.280]   Some of you guys are a lot more like, "Oh, I don't want to hurt that person."
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:13.480]   But regardless of your temperament, you were called to stimulate, incite people to loving
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   good deeds.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.600]   How do you do that?
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:24.220]   One way you don't do that is by forcing them to love, by forcing them, compelling them,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.040]   or guilt tripping them to love.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.800]   You guys follow me?
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.660]   Let me say something about guilt.
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.240]   Have you ever been guilt tripped to do something?
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.660]   You may have.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.980]   It may work.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.220]   But how long does that last?
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.720]   It doesn't last long.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:57.960]   And when that bitterness toward being guilt tripped over, when it kind of passes away,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.800]   there's a cynicism that remains.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:10.960]   Guilt is never a way that we should, never a means by which we should compel some, or
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.920]   stimulate somebody toward loving good deeds.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.300]   Guilt doesn't work.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.340]   You cannot guilt trip them by saying, "Oh, look at all that Jesus did for you to cause
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.460]   them to be more gracious."
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.740]   You can't do that.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.060]   So it does not mean to compel or to force.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.860]   The way you and I stimulate one another toward loving good deeds is that whenever we get
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:44.420]   together, we reflect on God's goodness in our lives, mull over the love of God, and
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:49.080]   strategize together how to respond appropriately.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.660]   So don't ever guilt trip people into following Christ.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.260]   That's why I don't believe in the Turner Burn gospel message.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.580]   Guilt is not something that God uses.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.540]   He convicts.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.060]   He points to sin, but he doesn't guilt trip and condemn people.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.160]   That's a tool of the enemy.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:14.000]   So here it says, "Let us consider how to stimulate one another to loving good deeds and not forsaking
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.400]   our own assembling together."
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.540]   Is the body of Christ important?
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.820]   Yes it is.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:32.900]   You know, last year, or two years ago, I was walking around my daughter's high chair, and
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:41.280]   I kicked with my pinky toe 25-pound weights that were sitting against the wall.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:48.580]   So I was walking past my daughter, and bop, my pinky toe went straight into a 25-pound
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.380]   weight, and I heard like a crack.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.580]   So I just thought, you know, I've stubbed my toe many times, because along with chubby
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.660]   fingers, sausage hands, I also have chubby toes.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:04.220]   So I was like, "Ow!" and then I couldn't walk for the next few days.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.580]   And so I actually had to go to the hospital, get that checked out, and for a very painful
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:16.140]   week and a half, I was in a boot, and my little tiny pinky toe that was chubby was all I could
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.740]   think about.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:25.200]   Because all my attention and all my focus went there.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.020]   When that little piece hurt, all of me hurt.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:38.860]   And when God saves us into His family, He doesn't save us into individual islands or
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.860]   units.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.060]   He saves us into one body.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:51.060]   So when you are a child of God, the local church is absolutely important to your spiritual
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.120]   well-being.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.280]   And when you hurt, the body of Christ hurts.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:03.900]   When you're happy, the body of Christ rejoices with you, and that is how God designed it.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.260]   Have you guys ever heard of a pastor named Charles Spurgeon?
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:14.060]   So he, there's a story where he actually visited the home of his, one of his members who had
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.540]   stopped coming out to church for about a month and a half.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.580]   It was in the cold of winter.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.820]   He knocks on the door and the man is shocked.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.460]   He's like, "Oh, pastor, what are you doing here?"
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:29.100]   And so they sit by the fireplace and they're just kind of shooting the breeze, and at the
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:35.700]   very beginning of the conversation, Charles Spurgeon grabs one coal out of the fireplace
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:40.260]   and just puts it aside and just keeps engaging in a conversation with this guy.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.860]   And the guy thought, "Dude, this is a very weird thing that my pastor did, because, you
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.060]   know, people don't come into your house and take out the coal in the fire."
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:53.540]   So they were engaging in a conversation, and the man kept looking at the coal.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.700]   And after about like 30 minutes, guess what happened to that piece of coal?
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.660]   It went black, it went cold, but the rest of the fire was still burning.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:08.380]   And then after about 30 minutes, the man looked at Charles Spurgeon, smiled, and said, "Pastor,
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.500]   I'll see you at church on Sunday."
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:20.820]   Your love and passion for God cannot be kindled outside of your involvement in the body of
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.820]   Christ.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:29.740]   And that is something that I want to just kind of reemphasize tonight.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:37.660]   By yourself, you will drift.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:45.160]   By yourself, you will drift.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:52.040]   But the tricky thing about sin and kind of like straying and wandering from the faith
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:58.660]   is when you are in sin, you want to be by yourself.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.740]   So the more you sin, the more you start withdrawing.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:08.540]   If you're doing something that everybody around you has told you is wrong, but you don't want
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.140]   to let that go, guess what's going to happen to you?
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.560]   You're going to start withdrawing from the people that actually care about you enough
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.780]   to tell you, "Look, I am speaking the truth in love here, brother.
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.620]   I am speaking the truth in love here, sister."
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.300]   But you are going to withdraw.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:32.060]   But when you unplug from the body of Christ, your love for Christ will grow cold and you
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.860]   are easy prey.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.900]   And we talked about yesterday, or today and yesterday, the enemy is out for blood.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.560]   Right?
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.900]   He wants you dead.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.880]   And the first step in doing that is to divide and conquer.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:52.900]   He wants to split you away from the rest of the body so that you're left in isolation
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.260]   and that your passions grow cold.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:01.620]   And that is something that you have to always be kind of mindful of.
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:06.020]   The enemy wants me alone.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:11.580]   The enemy wants me to be away from the body of Christ and he may plant thoughts in your
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.580]   head.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.900]   "Oh, that church is unhealthy."
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.460]   Yeah when you go, you don't really need them.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.620]   You're not going to be noticed if you don't go.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.100]   And you're going to start nitpicking things about the church that is going to make you
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.540]   want to stray.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:33.740]   So you actually have to be resolved to love the Word of God, to study the Word of God
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.140]   passionately and to do it with brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.420]   Are you guys following me?
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:48.580]   By yourself, you will drift.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:55.540]   If you feel like, "I need to withdraw because people are causing me to be stumbled."
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:59.220]   Or, "Yeah, I don't want people to know what I'm doing right now."
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:05.900]   If you have that impulse to withdraw, that may very well kill you.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.420]   And that's something you need to be aware of.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:17.740]   Do your best to plug in to the local body, to meet as often as you can with your brothers
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.860]   and sisters in Christ.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:27.020]   And I want to close going backward in Hebrews chapter 3.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:43.060]   Hebrews chapter 3, verses 12 to 13 is what I'm going to read.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:49.140]   Hebrews chapter 3, verses 12 to 13.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:35:00.700]   Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.680]   that falls away from the living God.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.460]   Because apostasy is real and it's a real danger.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:20.620]   Verse 13, "But encourage one another day after day as long as it is still called today, so
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:30.940]   that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:42.540]   How often should you guys get together with your brothers and sisters in Christ?
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.460]   As often as you can.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:55.340]   And whenever you get together, one of the first things that is on your mind should be,
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:02.180]   how do we daily rekindle our passion for this living God?
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:09.500]   Our heavenly daddy with whom we have absolute confidence, the one who is on our side, the
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:15.300]   one whose love we can never be separated from if we indeed are children of God.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:23.500]   Verse 13 says, "But encourage one another day after day as long as it is called today,"
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.820]   because the day is approaching, "so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.820]   of sin."
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.460]   This isn't that complicated.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.500]   I need you.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.800]   You need me.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.780]   We need each other.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:48.620]   You need the people sitting around you.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:53.660]   I am committed to rejoice when you are rejoicing.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:58.520]   I am committed to mourn with you when you go through times of mourning.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:05.980]   I am committed to speak the truth in love, in rebuke, and encouragement.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:11.540]   And you need to do the same for me and for the people around you because by ourselves
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.460]   we are weak.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:22.580]   So when you are tempted to withdraw from the body of Christ, be very careful.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:28.420]   Drifting may already have started in your heart.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:35.620]   The more you feel like you're wrestling with sin, the more you need to cling to the people
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.340]   around you.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.140]   That will prevent you from sin.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.780]   Unless you're clinging to people who are indulgence and then it's just chaos.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:56.340]   You and I always, we need to commit to growing in the Word of God and growing hand in hand
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.060]   with other people in the Word of God.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.820]   And that is how God set it up.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.060]   You know, recently this week, do you know our church is a part of a denomination?
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.900]   Anybody know what that is?
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.580]   Our church is Southern Baptist.
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:17.580]   And recently there was an article, I forget who published it, but about 700 something
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:23.340]   pastors in the Southern Baptist denomination, it's one of the largest ones in the world,
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:34.100]   so about 700 local church pastors have been publicly accused, called out, even sued for
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.420]   sexual impropriety.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.660]   Did anybody see that article?
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.100]   Yeah, it's actually kind of a big thing.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.380]   And then the Gospel Coalition started talking about it.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:46.780]   And so it's actually on, it's kind of being passed around on the internet.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:52.260]   Southern Baptist pastors, 700 something people, it's kind of like the Christian version of
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.820]   now the Me Too movement.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:39:00.260]   All these people are coming out speaking against the pastors in their churches.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:05.260]   So one brother who I meet up with regularly actually asked me, he said, "Pastor Peter,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.500]   does Berean have some kind of protocol?"
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:19.300]   So let's say if one of our sisters at our church is harassed or mistreated or like sexually
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:24.340]   abused in some sense, like where they can turn to?
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:29.740]   Is there some kind of protocol on your job description on how to handle the women at
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.740]   our church?
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.180]   And I actually kind of thought through that.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.300]   I said, "You know, there isn't.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.500]   There isn't anything on paper.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:44.900]   I didn't receive any HR training on like just impropriety and stuff when I came to this
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.780]   church or when I came back to the church."
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:52.340]   But I said, "You know, brother, we don't have that.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:40:00.260]   But we have so many things set up just naturally that I don't think there necessarily might
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:06.420]   be a need for some kind of on paper standards to be written."
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:13.500]   Okay, so pay attention, especially for you sisters, on what I told this brother.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:18.300]   First of all, the four of us pastors, we see our schedules together every week.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:26.140]   We pass out, we, everybody, all of our pastors know who's meeting with who, male or female,
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.660]   where they're preaching, everything we just share naturally.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:36.500]   And we're pretty much committed to being at church, unless we're doing some kind of ministry,
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:40.140]   every day from at least nine to five.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:44.100]   And because we do have a lot of sisters at our church, if we actually do have to counsel
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:50.900]   or talk to one, this has never been shared, but we always leave the door open so that
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:55.940]   people, if there's a sister in the room, someone understands that, "Oh, there's a conversation
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.280]   going on and it's not private."
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:07.300]   But if it really is a very private conversation and very, like, just painful details need
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.260]   to be shared, we close the door, but we open the blinds.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.420]   And if at all possible, every conversation that we have, we try to keep it at the cafe
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.260]   tables.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:22.180]   We know what we're all doing together.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:28.020]   And Pastor Peter, Pastor Mark, myself, and Pastor Nate, we pray together at some point
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.520]   almost every day.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.260]   We talk about church almost every day.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.120]   We talk about you guys almost every day.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:42.660]   We go after in prayer all the people that we need to shepherd together.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:54.500]   And because we're always together, I feel like it's kind of tough to even be tempted
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.900]   to do anything to stray.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:08.460]   My biggest prevention, the biggest preventer of any impropriety is my brothers in Christ
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.340]   who share that floor with me every day.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:20.820]   The source of the most humbling rebuke, challenge, and stimulation to love and good deeds comes
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.420]   from those men.
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.900]   And I tell people, like, they're like, "Oh, are you adjusting okay to America?"
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.780]   I'm like, "This is the happiest I've been in 10 years."
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.820]   And I'll say that to you.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.060]   This is the happiest I've been in 10 years.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.620]   Do you know why?
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:43.100]   I come every day to work, to just spend time doing kingdom work with brothers that love
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.860]   the Lord, that love His Word, and that love me.
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.580]   There's nothing better.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:54.260]   That prevents so much.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.580]   And yeah, we play ping pong.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:59.140]   And the funny thing is every time we play ping pong, church people come in, and they
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.540]   think that's all we're doing.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:06.860]   Just as a reference, we play ping pong Tuesday afternoons really only, okay, the four of
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.500]   us.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.100]   And if like Ryan or whoever is there, then they challenge us, and then we have to, you
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.620]   know, like, we have to actually like step up, and we got to play.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:21.460]   But that's for ministry, not for pleasure.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:27.940]   But when you have like-minded people who love God, love His Word, love each other, silly
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:35.060]   stuff like ping pong really becomes fellowship.
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:45.440]   Just goofing around, playing a board game becomes family time.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:58.560]   The best way to keep from drifting is to stick yourself with people who are not drifting.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:03.920]   To latch on to people who are spiritually heavy.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.560]   Spiritually light people, right?
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.760]   But a really spiritually fat person, you just cling on.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.800]   That person's not going to move.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:24.560]   But imagine a church like ours, a BAM group of 250 people, every member in this 250, with
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:31.160]   all our imperfections, with all our insecurities, with all our quirks and weird habits, if all
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:38.160]   of us commit to loving God, loving His Word, loving our neighbor, there aren't going to
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.040]   be many scandals in this place.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:46.000]   There aren't going to be people who are drifting out from this place.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.560]   There aren't going to be random, silly things that divide the church in this place, if we're
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.880]   all committed to loving God by knowing His Word and applying His Word by loving each
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:04.520]   other and stimulating each other to love and good deeds.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:11.120]   You cannot nag someone to Christlikeness.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.520]   Some of you guys have been nagged, I know.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.160]   Because some of you guys complain that somebody, you know that person spiritually nagged me
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.160]   or something.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.800]   And that really was done out of love, probably.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:30.820]   But as we grow in Christlikeness, we move other people to grow in Christlikeness without
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.920]   even saying a word.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.960]   "Man, I want to be like that guy.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.520]   Man, I want to love the Lord like that guy.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.840]   Man, that sister really prays hard.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.640]   Maybe I should just pray with her.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:52.360]   Man, that family's going to overseas missions work.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.600]   Maybe I should pray to do that.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.240]   That guy every weekend goes to visit an orphanage or goes to visit a homeless shelter.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:06.560]   Man, I couldn't do that, but maybe I should start trying."
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.760]   The more you thrive in your relationship with God, you will start seeing others around you
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.920]   thrive.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.660]   It's not complicated.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:23.960]   But if your get-togethers are always just about goofing around and having fun without
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:32.320]   Christ involved, there's nothing necessarily in and of itself wrong, but you may drift
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.880]   together.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:41.640]   And I've seen that in our group too, where people hang out and just do silly stuff all
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.680]   the time.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:48.640]   Not necessarily sinful, but you kind of get cold together.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:55.400]   But imagine if you are on fire for the Lord, and you're like, "Dude, let me share with
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:00.080]   you what the Lord is teaching me," and you grab onto a brother and sister, and you share
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.600]   with them all that's being done in your life.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.320]   You don't think that person's going to be challenged and encouraged and inspired?
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.120]   But what if we all did it together?
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.360]   I guarantee you no one's going to be drifted.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:20.000]   No one's going to be straying away, because we're always being recharged and being sharpened
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.720]   together.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:29.040]   So I don't know if necessarily our pastors, we need to have some kind of rules down on
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.980]   paper about any kind of impropriety.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:37.240]   A lot of our job description, it doesn't work, because all four pastors are doing more than
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.720]   the job description requires.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:44.200]   You know, we are our worst enemy, because we keep creating more work.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:49.840]   You know, you have four workaholic pastors who create more and more and more work.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.720]   People are doing Bible studies and discipleships all the time.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.440]   We're already juggling full plates, but someone goes, "Can you meet with me?"
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.840]   "Okay," and we go there.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.520]   We're not the best at administration, because we're all too busy doing ministry.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.680]   That's why communication sometimes is slow.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.560]   But when – you know why I do that?
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:17.920]   It's not just because I'm extra motivated, but because these brothers around me are doing
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:27.680]   it, and I want to carry my load to building this church with these men.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:36.480]   But see, the pastors don't necessarily make the church.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.360]   Christ builds His church.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.920]   And it can't just be the pastors who honor the Word of God.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:49.960]   It has to be the entire body.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:55.920]   I don't want you guys to think so much about drifting.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:02.480]   Focus more on growing together, and drifting won't be an issue.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.000]   Amen?
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:13.360]   I'm going to read Hebrews 3, 12 to 13 again.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:18.040]   Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:22.480]   that falls away from the living God.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:31.040]   But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called today, so that
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:50.640]   none of you
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:57.840]   will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:07.400]   Anchor deep and help others anchor deep.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:12.280]   If you can remember that from this retreat, this was a good retreat, even though we didn't
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:20.960]   go to the mountains, even though we didn't see no snow or throw shaved ice at each other.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:38.080]   Anchor deep into His Word and stimulate others to do the same.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:52.240]   As the BAM young adult pastor, I'm committing to do that.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:51:03.880]   And doing my best to try not to go anywhere near sin, focusing all of my waking hours
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:19.200]   to His Word and to prayer, so that I can establish a strong anchor, so that you can anchor with
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:25.560]   me and not drift.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:41.240]   Because in Orange County, the worries of this life, riches, deceitfulness of wealth, pleasures
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:49.240]   are trying to kill you, kill all the fruit that you could potentially bear.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:58.400]   And I see it and I hate it.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:06.560]   And my commitment is to fight with and for you.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.400]   But you need to do the same for each other.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:19.520]   And you need to do the same for the pastors and the church leaders.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.440]   You know who gets shot at first in war?
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.040]   The people in the front.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:34.280]   And as the Berean leadership stands in the front, trying to lead this charge of together
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:42.720]   building the kingdom of God and doing our role as this local body of Christ, we are
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:47.640]   the first ones to get attacked by all kinds of stuff.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:56.160]   Distraction, temptation, discouragement, fatigue.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:02.680]   We've got your back and you've got to get ours.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.720]   This cannot be a pastor-centric church.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:16.880]   It has to be a God-centered, word-intensive church in order for us to bear fruit that
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.320]   will give God honor and glory.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:28.280]   You guys understand the procession, like the progression of my thoughts here?
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:35.600]   We fight for His glory together.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:44.480]   And as the enemy is constantly wanting us to fall apart, we have to be resolved to anchor
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:49.000]   deep, hunker down, and fight for one another.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.560]   To rejoice with one another, weep with one another, pray with one another, read with
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:54:00.840]   one another, memorize with one another, study with one another.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.960]   And fruit will be born.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   Our call is not to bear fruit.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.040]   He does that.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:14.400]   Our call is just to be faithful and to love.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:20.640]   My hope is that we learn how to do that properly and we learn how to do that together.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.640]   Amen?
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:39.960]   Let's pray.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:48.320]   Thank you, Lord, for teaching us tonight about the great freedom we have in Christ.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:57.080]   And I pray that you would help us to remember not to use our liberty as a license to sin,
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:08.760]   but to use our liberty and freedom to release other people from their bondage to sin in
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.020]   the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.780]   Help us to cherish the body of Christ.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:28.560]   Help us to build up your church and to passionately carry our load, do our part to building up
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.160]   your kingdom.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.000]   Help us to stimulate one another to love and good deeds.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:44.120]   Help us to encourage one another and really at all times to point one another to the Lord
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.580]   Jesus Christ.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:56.840]   Thank you, Father, for just this reminder this weekend that Christ is central and that
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.500]   Christ is enough.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   Help us to remember.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.420]   We pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:13.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
