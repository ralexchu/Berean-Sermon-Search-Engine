[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   All right, let's look at this picture.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.480]   So just a quick review before we get started.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.680]   This is the first bowl.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.420]   So what does the first bowl fall under?
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.640]   People who had the number of the beast.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.880]   And I don't know why that picture is of an Asian.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880]   It's an Asian.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.120]   Okay.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.560]   And then what's that one on?
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.840]   What happens to the second bowl?
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.240]   The waters, all the waters, right?
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.920]   They turn to blood.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.920]   And then the third one?
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.120]   The rivers and springs, the fresh water turns to blood.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.120]   What's that one?
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.320]   Sun, right?
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.600]   The fourth one falls in the sun and then torches the people.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600]   And what's that one?
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.080]   Huh?
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.800]   Right, falls on the beast and its kingdom, right?
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   And then here?
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.360]   Right?
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.400]   Okay.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.560]   So there's a huge earthquake that takes place and it dries up the river Euphrates.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.520]   And then what's that one?
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.520]   What is that?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.800]   Yeah, the gigantic hill.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   How many pounds?
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800]   We're done.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   That's it.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   That's what I was saying.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.800]   All right, let me pray first.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.800]   We'll jump in.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:46.680]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you again for sustaining us, for loving us.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.680]   We pray that each word, each passage we study, that it would cause us to be sober, that it's
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.000]   not just intriguing things that we are studying, but your ordained history, Father God, that
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   we're looking at.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.600]   So we pray, Father God, that you would continue to mold our hearts and our thoughts and our
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.960]   lives according to your word.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.920]   Okay, so the first thing I ask you to do is to compare with the three different judgments.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.120]   So if you look at the general judgments of the three judgments, what's the first one?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.040]   The seal judgments, right?
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.960]   And so each one of the seal is being opened up, and at the beginning of the seal judgments,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.240]   what do you see?
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.640]   The four horsemen, right?
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.520]   And each one of them representing different judgments of God.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.420]   But the seal judgment primarily is an introduction where the Lamb of God, remember it begins
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.840]   with people are crying because there's no one worthy to open up the scroll, and then
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.640]   the Lamb of God shows up, and because of his righteousness and sacrifice, that he's able
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   to open up the scroll.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.200]   And so one by one, the scrolls are being opened up, and that's the judgment.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.340]   So the first seven seal judgments is the initiation of the judgment, right?
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.040]   And then we have the second set, the trumpet judgment.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.680]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.560]   What does the trumpet represent?
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.120]   Like warning, right?
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.480]   So when you're in the army, or if you're in the context of battle, or maybe if you
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.080]   were wandering in the desert, you don't blow a trumpet before somebody goes to sleep.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.280]   You blow the trumpet to wake people up, right?
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.200]   So the trumpet judgments, each one of them is kind of serves as a warning to the world
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.580]   that the real judgment is what?
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.220]   The bold judgments, right?
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.440]   So each one of the seven trumpet judgments is kind of a preparation to kind of sober
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.400]   people up and saying, "This is coming," so that it wouldn't catch you off guard, at least
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   for the Christians.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.000]   So there's the seven judgments of the trumpets to prepare, and then the final bold judgment,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.720]   how would you describe the bold judgment?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   The wrath, right?
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.400]   They were all wrath of God, but the bold judgments are the final, complete.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.280]   So all of the other things were warning that it was coming, and then finally it has come,
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   right?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.720]   So remember in the previous passages where there's promises are made that he's no longer
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.500]   going to delay, meaning that the final judgment is going to come, the end is coming.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.600]   And so the bold judgment is the beginning of the very, very end, okay?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.880]   So when we were to compare, there are many similarities, and I'm not going to go through
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.640]   all of them, but one of the things I hope you noticed between the, specifically between
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.080]   the trumpet and the bold judgments, that in each one of the judgments, and I have a chart
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.560]   for this later on, but where you see the plagues are thrust upon the earth, sea, fresh waters,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   and heavenly beings.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.920]   Actually, so let me just show this.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.920]   Can you see that?
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   Is it too small?
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.000]   Okay, I couldn't, because I cut and pasted it, I couldn't make it any bigger.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.040]   So hopefully you guys can see it.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.520]   So if you notice here the similarities, right?
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.080]   Third of the sea life destroyed, all sea life destroyed.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.240]   Third of fresh water poisoned, all water poisoned.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.200]   Third of the sun, moon, stars, scorching sun.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.520]   So if you look at, again, the demonic locusts, the darkness falling upon the demonic world,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.000]   so you'll see very similar things, the Euphrates, the river.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.480]   And so you see a parallel between the judgment of the trumpets and then the judgment of the
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.240]   bolds, right?
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:42.120]   And so that's the similarity, but what are the differences?
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.640]   And we're going to highlight some of the differences.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.160]   That's what I forgot to do today.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.360]   I forgot to black out all this stuff.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.200]   You're just going to have to figure it out, okay?
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.440]   So as you're reading it, you're going to have to do a little bit more work.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.680]   I knew I forgot something.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.640]   I had all this time left over.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:12.040]   Okay, so as you're reading it, you see the blanks, just fill it in.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:19.440]   So the trumpet plagues are partial in that it only affects one third of the earth, right?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.840]   So the bold judgment affects is universal, right?
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.320]   And that's why, remember I asked you last week, when you look at the, look and compare,
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.520]   the bold judgments are very short verses.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.320]   In fact, it just kind of states in some of the judgments are literally one sentence and
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.040]   then it just kind of moves on.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.480]   And so when you look at the length of the passage, it seems like it's not that significant
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.840]   until you actually start reading what it says.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.280]   And if you read the content of what it says, the trumpet judgments were actually much longer.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.440]   It lasts, I think, a couple chapters, but here it's not even a full chapter, right?
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.960]   They're just smaller sections of it, but in the trumpet judgment, it was a third where
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.620]   this judgment is complete and full.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.080]   The trumpet judgments function in part as a warning of repentance.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.040]   Remember, that's what the trumpet was for.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.800]   And at the end of it, it's almost kind of like, you know, the third is being judged,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:23.280]   but the two thirds are given opportunity to repent where the bold judgments is final,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.360]   right?
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.160]   If you remember at the end of chapter 16, he says it is finished, it's complete.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:38.100]   So the purpose of the bold judgment is just judgment, that God's promise judgment is going
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.640]   to come and everything else up to this point, there's an opportunity to repent, right?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640]   But it's complete.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.080]   The trumpet judgments affected people indirectly.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.420]   So the judgments were coming.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:56.800]   So let's say if, you know, the rivers would turn dark or whatever, as a side effect that
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.880]   people would be affected by it.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.920]   But the bold judgment, it says the judgment is directly upon people, is targeted toward
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.120]   people.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:12.700]   So you can kind of see just in reference how the trumpet and the seal judgments, as severe
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.080]   as they were, it was to kind of keep people sober.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.980]   So if you're a Christian, you've been paying attention to all of this stuff.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:27.360]   And if, again, if we happen to be in the tribulation and we are seeing all of this stuff, it is
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.980]   an opportunity to be sober and to repent and bring people to repentance.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.140]   You would assume that when the tribulation starts, and if the church is here, there would
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.140]   also be a great revival that breaks out, that the church is going to be purified, there's
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.820]   going to be greater sense of evangelism in the midst of all of this, right?
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.960]   Which is kind of like what's going on in Iran right now, with the intense persecution happening
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960]   in the Middle East.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.880]   There are constant stories that are coming out that the percentage of Christians, Muslims,
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:03.480]   who are converting to Christianity is greater than they've ever seen it in modern history.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.560]   And so in the context of severe persecution, revival is also breaking out over there in
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   the Middle East.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.640]   And so that's what we would assume is happening, up to the trumpet judgment.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.920]   But when the bowl judgment comes, it's just judgment, right?
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.820]   So let's jump into each of these.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.720]   The first bowl judgment, the judgment is directly targeted at the people who have the mark of
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.160]   the beast and worship his name.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.520]   That's where the Asian lady comes in, in that picture, right?
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.880]   So it's specifically targeted to those who have compromised and they have received the
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.400]   mark of the beast.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   And judgment is coming directly upon them.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:45.440]   So the first judgment is a direct attack upon them.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.740]   They will be judged with harmful and painful sores.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.220]   For the sake of time, because we have seven judgments, I'm not going to go to these passages,
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.080]   but in chapter 14, 9 through 11, we also see that.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.000]   And Zechariah 14, 12 also has a prophecy that at the end time, God was going to bring sores
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.200]   and God's going to bring judgment through sores.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.440]   So again, this is not unique to revelation.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.160]   God has left imprints of his final bowl judgments all throughout scripture.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   And we're going to see that.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.480]   I'm not going to go to it, but I'm just going to give you references to it.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.320]   But the sores will not affect the believers, right?
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.880]   The judgment is coming and it's specifically targeted, these plagues are specifically targeted
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.800]   to the people who have the mark of the beast.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:40.040]   What was interesting is one of the commentators, you know, the way they worded it was those
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.360]   who have the mark of the beast at the final judgment will eventually have the mark of
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.680]   God's judgment on them.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.600]   And that's what's happening on the first bowl.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:58.200]   The second bowl judgment, the judgment is poured directly into the sea.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.400]   It turned like the blood of a corpse and every living thing in the sea died as a result.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.720]   So what's a blood of a corpse?
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:13.800]   It's coagulated blood, means the whole body of water is going to become completely useless,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   right?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.040]   This coagulated blood, you're not going to be able to sail in it and nothing is going
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.880]   to be able to live in it at all, right?
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.120]   And so, and it is universal, it's complete.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.880]   It doesn't say it's targeting a specific area.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.620]   All of the body of water is going to turn like dead man's blood, right?
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.900]   So this judgment is similar to the first plague that we see in Egypt and the second trumpet
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:42.460]   judgment in chapter 8, 8 through 9.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.400]   And this will be worldwide universal judgment.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:56.840]   Since the earth is covered by 70% of the world with water, it basically means if 70% of the
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.380]   body of water turns to coagulated blood, this is universal.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.660]   It's going to affect everybody who's living at this time, right?
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.420]   So it's a universal judgment.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:15.220]   And this is part of the reason why pre-trip people believe in pre-trip because of the
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:21.180]   extent of this judgment, how the argument is the church can't be living through this,
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.180]   okay?
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.180]   That's the pre-trip.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:29.540]   So if you want to argue with me about pre-trip, you know, cite this.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:36.500]   The third bowl judgment, verses 4 through 7, the judgment is poured into the rivers
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.380]   and springs of water, right?
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:45.220]   So where before was the body of the ocean and then now it's the freshwater.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:52.020]   It says they became blood.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.540]   The third trumpet judgment resulted in poisoning of one third of the world's freshwater, but
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:06.980]   now it will be completely destroyed, right?
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.580]   So think about that.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:15.220]   If freshwater is destroyed, right, and you can't use it, and the whole ocean water becomes
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.780]   coagulated, what happens to the people?
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.220]   Well, supposedly, I don't know how long you can live without food, but I hear somewhere
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.700]   around four, four weeks or something like that, okay?
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.700]   That's if you're very healthy, but you can't live without water for more than what, four
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.700]   days?
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.620]   Okay, am I just making this up?
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.820]   You guys probably know better than I do, but, you know, water is not just important, it's
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.820]   essential.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.900]   So the fact that there is no water that you're going to be able to drink means, again, that
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.100]   the survival rate is going to be very, very low, right?
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.060]   So this judgment, again, when you just read the length of it and you say, "Oh, you know,
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.380]   water turns," this sounds very similar to what we saw in Egypt, it sounds very similar
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.960]   to the trumpet judgment, but when you actually look at the details of what it is saying,
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.620]   it is much more severe than anything that we've seen up to this point, right?
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:20.980]   Similar language, but the extent and the degree is much more severe.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.040]   This is the same judgment that happened to the Nile River in Egypt, or at least the turning
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   of the blood.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.140]   And then the angel that carried out the judgment on the water breaks out into praise for God's
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.140]   righteous judgment.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.260]   So let's look at verse 16.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.860]   At verse 4, "The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water,
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.460]   and they became blood.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.500]   And I heard the angel charge of the water say, 'Just are you, O Holy One, who is and
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.340]   who was, for you brought these judgments.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.780]   For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.780]   drink.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.780]   It is what they deserve.'"
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:02.060]   Typically, when you think of praising and worship, it usually happens when there's deliverance
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.500]   or blessing from God.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.900]   But here, the angel comes out and he breaks out into singing because of the judgment of
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.900]   God.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.820]   And even in the context of God pouring out his judgment, it's an illustration of his
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.680]   glory.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.460]   So worship isn't just when what we perceive to be good is happening, but even when God
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:31.020]   is pouring out his wrath, the angel breaks out in singing.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:36.600]   The reason given for their specific judgment was the persecution of his children, killing
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   of God's children.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:45.520]   In other words, it was retribution for harming God's children.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:53.100]   As they spilled the blood of martyrs, they will be given blood to drink for their punishment.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.520]   So we don't know if this is going to be a literal thing where, you know, the rivers
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.700]   that they bloodied with the blood of martyrs, and that's the only water that they're going
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.700]   to have to drink.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.220]   They're going to have to drink the blood of the martyrs.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.960]   And that was the judgment that God's going to bring upon the end.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.060]   And then it talks about how the altar also breaks out into singing, and the altar is
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.500]   symbolic of the martyrs.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.300]   Do you remember where they come out?
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:23.940]   Remember Revelation chapter 6, 9, where the martyrs are under the altar praising, and
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.900]   then they are not praising, but they were praying to God, "How long, O Lord?"
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.900]   How long, O Lord?
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:36.140]   And God responds to that in judgment, that those who martyr them are also going to be
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.580]   the first recipients of God's wrath.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:47.140]   So again, as I mentioned last week and even on the pulpit on Sunday, that in the context
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:53.980]   of just utter devastation, God is still being worshipped.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.260]   Worship is still taking place.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:01.340]   Because ultimately, why is the judgment coming in the first place?
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.560]   Because they refuse to honor and worship God.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:11.300]   So in the context of this judgment, heavens and the angels, the elders, the beasts, they're
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:18.100]   all in constant worship of God against those who refuse to worship Him.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.560]   So the worship of the angels is in contrast to those who are receiving the judgment.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:32.140]   The fourth bowl judgment, unlike the fourth trumpet that produced third of the sun, moon
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.380]   and the stars darkened in the fourth, fourth bowl poured out on the sun is followed by
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.660]   intense heat to scorch people with fire.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:48.260]   So everything that God has given to the world to sustain life is one by one being taken
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.000]   out.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.920]   So let me say it again.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:01.820]   When God created the world, He created one by one for six days everything that man needs
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.660]   in order to survive.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.540]   So He created vegetation, the animal, the air, the light, the day.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.620]   So He creates all of these things and then when God has made enough to sustain life,
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.740]   then He creates man.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:22.580]   If you look at the judgment, God is slowly taking one by one away everything that we
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:27.120]   need as a necessity to sustain life, He's taking it away.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.620]   And we say it all the time how it is only by the grace of God that we're able to breathe
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.840]   and move and have our being.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.060]   God is allowing us to live because He's allowing us to have enough oxygen.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:42.460]   He's allowing the sun to stay at a distance and provide the sun to sustain life.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.060]   He's allowing the water so that we can drink and sustain life.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.780]   So all of these things are necessities that we need for sustaining life.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.860]   But when God's judgment comes, He's basically taking away every little thing that is required
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.460]   for us to live, that God put there.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:07.620]   So if you refuse to worship me, if you refuse to submit to me, I'm going to let you go and
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.720]   try to live on your own.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.660]   So basically that's what's happening.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.060]   The judgment is coming one by one.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.340]   He's taking away everything that they need to sustain life.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.220]   Though they understood that the judgment was coming from God, instead of repenting, and
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.860]   this phrase is repeated three separate times in this section, they curse the name of God
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.100]   and refuse to repent and give glory to Him.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.060]   And that's exactly what it says in Romans 121.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:37.720]   The reason why the wrath of God is being revealed is because although everything God needed
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.260]   to show was very plain to them in creation, they refuse to honor God and give glory to
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.260]   God.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:51.980]   And so here, you would think, at least from our perspective, that one thing, if disaster
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:57.580]   came and you don't understand where the disaster came from, but here it says it's clear and
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.440]   they're going to know that it was from God.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.840]   They're going to know that judgment is coming from God.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.580]   But instead of repenting, they turn and shake their fist at God, right?
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.860]   And they curse Him.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.980]   And each one, as it gets more and more intense, instead of softening their heart in repentance,
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:20.940]   and even now if they would repent, God would forgive their sins, right?
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.940]   But they refuse.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.300]   And the whole reason why they're here in the first place is because they hardened their
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.900]   heart, they hardened their heart, and they hardened their heart.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:35.520]   And then when the final judgment came, it's so hardened that even at the verge of eternal
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.540]   hell, they're cursing God, right?
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:45.460]   So there is not a single person who's going to be entering into hell who has any hint
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.120]   of repentance in them, right?
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.540]   Every single one of them are going to be cursing God as they go, right?
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.560]   At least that's the picture that we see.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.180]   We're not seeing a group of people who are begging God for mercy and God says, "Enough.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.960]   You know, I've given you enough time to repent and it's too late," right?
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.400]   That's not what we see.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.260]   Every single soul that is condemned, as they are entering into hell, are going to be shaking
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.920]   their fist at God and curse you.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.120]   That's basically what we're seeing.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.200]   The fifth bowl judgment.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.140]   The judgment is directed toward the throne of the beast.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:31.240]   And as a result of this, his kingdom will be darkened.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.280]   Maybe spiritually it's going to be darkened.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.860]   Maybe it's going to fall into depravity and they're going to end up hurting each other.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.720]   Not sure.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.800]   Maybe God's going to withhold his peace, right?
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.820]   And allow sin to just have his full reign.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.900]   And then there's going to be wars back and forth.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.200]   There's nothing holding them back, right?
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.720]   They're going to fall into darkness.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.440]   Even as the people of the world are gnawing their teeth in anguish, instead of repenting,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.360]   again, they say they curse God for their suffering and did not repent of their deeds to the very
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   end.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:18.080]   And it's always interesting to me when tragedy hits people's lives, why some people grow
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.840]   in their faith and some people turn away from God.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.440]   And I can never predict, right?
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.600]   For sure, we've seen people where suffering comes into their life and as a result of that,
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.040]   they're sanctified and they end up running to God.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.160]   And then you see a bunch of people who say, "I'll never go to church because God did this
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.840]   to me."
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.800]   Or it may not even be them.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.240]   They saw suffering in somewhere else and said, "Well, if God's going to do that, I'm not
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.240]   going to worship him."
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.960]   And they curse God, right?
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:56.000]   So the same grace, same love, same wrath falls upon everybody and yet some repent and some
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.280]   shake their fist at God, right?
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:04.720]   So to the very bitter end, those who are under condemnation, they're condemned because they
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.700]   refuse, right?
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.480]   Not because they weren't given the opportunity, right?
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:18.440]   They had every opportunity but to the bitter end, they refuse to relent, right?
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:25.660]   The sixth bowl judgment, this judgment is poured out on the River Euphrates and dried
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.720]   it up to prepare for the coming of the kings from the east.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.360]   Now there's, depending on different commentaries, they'll tell you different things but I think
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:45.000]   what made most sense to me is that the River Euphrates is mentioned before.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.760]   This judgment is poured out on the River Euphrates and dried it to prepare the coming of the
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:56.340]   kings of the ages and then the Euphrates formed the eastern border of the land of Israel.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.760]   So the dried bed of Euphrates will allow the armies from the east to cross into current
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760]   Palestinian territories.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:07.080]   So in other words, it's allowing, if you look at it again, if you were to look at the current
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:15.520]   atmosphere now, what's at the east of Jerusalem?
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.600]   What's on the east of Jerusalem?
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.200]   The whole Middle East, right?
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:29.120]   Iraq, Iran, Syria, I mean all the Middle East countries that want to see Israel wiped out,
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   right?
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.800]   So when the River Euphrates dries up, they're able to cross and basically they're gearing
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.920]   up for battle.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.300]   That's the picture that we're seeing here, right?
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.560]   So the bold judgment comes, the earthquake hits, is it an earthquake yet?
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:57.960]   No, no, the Euphrates, it dries up and then it says they prepare for battle, right?
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:06.680]   Oops.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:13.800]   So remember chapter 12 and 13, you have the dragon, who's the dragon?
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.060]   Satan.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:20.560]   And then you have the beast, number one, Antichrist.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.880]   And then the third beast is, yeah, second beast is the false prophet.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.800]   And so you see the same trio that shows up here, right?
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.840]   The three that mimic the Trinity in chapter 12 and 13, they reappear at the very end.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.280]   And it says the mouths of each of the dragons, beasts, and the false prophets signifying
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.320]   their lying work to deceive the kings and their kingdoms for the battle on the great
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:53.200]   day of God, the Almighty, which is what we commonly call the Armageddon, right?
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:59.800]   Armageddon is the final battle where Satan, Antichrist, the false prophets are going to
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.440]   put all their effort, all into it.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:08.280]   The river Euphrates dries up, they prepare an army to come into the great city, right?
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   Which is Jerusalem.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:15.040]   Again, if you read different commentaries, they might have different interpretation,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:21.280]   but typically if you're a pre-trip or post-trip, pre-millennial view, this is the view.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.760]   Again, so if you didn't understand anything I said, don't worry about it, okay?
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:32.200]   So it's interesting, this is picturing a battle at the end where Israel is going to be attacked
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.340]   from all sides, right?
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.360]   They're going to come in and they're going to come in and it's not a triumph of victory
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:46.560]   where the Euphrates dries up and then Satan, the Antichrist, bolsters up the different
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.100]   nations and then they come in to attack.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.380]   And that's where Armageddon happens and that's what we're going to read about in chapter
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:57.320]   17 and 18, where the final battle takes place and then the judgment against Satan and his
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.500]   kingdom is finally going to happen, right?
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.840]   And then they're going to be bound.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.840]   So chapter 16 is the bold judgments that is going to initiate the Armageddon, right?
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   And Armageddon, how many of you heard the term Armageddon before?
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.840]   Okay.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.680]   How many of you who heard it before came from a Presbyterian church?
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.280]   Okay, only one, all right.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.180]   So typically you're not going to hear that in a Presbyterian church, okay.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.720]   But again, that's what the Armageddon is.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.040]   Armageddon is the final battle where Satan is going to be bound for a thousand years.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.560]   And so all of this is a setup for all of that, okay?
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:38.920]   And it says, "From their mouths came unclean spirits of frogs."
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:44.240]   And the reason why the frogs, the frogs were commonly understood as vile and unclean, right?
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:51.880]   In other words, these three satanic trio are going to put all their efforts to lie and
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   to deceive.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.640]   Remember Jesus says that at the very end, a deception is going to be so strong that
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:02.480]   even the elect, if that was possible, would be deceived, right?
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:08.080]   So at the very end, the satanic effort to deceive the world is going to be ratcheted
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.960]   to the highest level it's ever come.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.480]   So in other words, people are going to be confused as to what is and isn't the truth
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:20.160]   at the very end, and that's satanic work, right?
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.560]   These demonic spirits will perform signs to assemble the demonic kingdom for the battle
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.520]   of the Armageddon.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.080]   And the way he's going to muscle them up is by deception and lying.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:37.400]   And that's the primary way that Satan works all throughout Scripture, right?
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:43.760]   Did Satan scare Eve to eat the forbidden fruit?
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   It deceived her.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.440]   Did Satan come to Jesus and threaten him?
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.000]   No, try to deceive him, right?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.400]   So when satanic activity is described, anywhere it's described in the Scripture, it's often
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.400]   described as scheming, right?
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.800]   And the way he schemes is he's the father of lies.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.320]   He's the accuser.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.560]   And so he's perverting truth, right?
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.760]   That's the primary way that he deceives and divides the church, and he conquers and he
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.320]   halts the gospel ministry is by deception, right?
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.520]   And that's why it's so important for us that unless we allow the Word of God to constantly
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:29.160]   judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart, every single one of us is susceptible, every
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.120]   single one of us is susceptible to the schemes of the devil, right?
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.520]   And we think, "No, I mean, I mix."
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.000]   You may think you're in the truth, right?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.880]   But we're not more powerful than Satan.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:50.940]   So if his primary work is to deceive, our primary back to truth, right?
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.960]   If our enemy's attack is constantly trying to deceive, and he says that from their mouth
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.400]   all these vile things are going to come out to blaspheme the name of God and deceive the
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:07.200]   world to build up this kingdom to rebel against God, our primary fight is to cling to truth.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.620]   And clinging to truth isn't just clinging to the proper exposition of the Word of God.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.000]   You can have all the truth and be dead wrong in your heart, right?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.320]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.120]   You can do all the right things for all the wrong motives.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.560]   And that's why truth has to be objective truth, right?
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:33.020]   But it also has to be personal truth, that you're able to judge the thoughts and intentions
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.600]   according to the Word of God.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.480]   So that's our primary battle.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:42.940]   Our primary battle is to know and hear the voice of God and follow him, right?
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.360]   Because that's what Satan is constantly trying to do.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:51.300]   Our thoughts, our hearts, our intentions to deceive us, to drag us away from who he is.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.120]   And that's the work that is described here.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:59.640]   And then when he gathers his army, he's going to, again, he's going to enter into Armageddon
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.560]   for the final battle, right?
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.800]   The Lord's coming will be like a thief to those under judgment, but to the blessed of
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:15.720]   God who stay awake will not be naked or exposed, right?
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:21.000]   So again, this is my argument for post-trip, right?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.240]   So the intense judgment, but here it clearly says that those Christians will be preserved.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.100]   So if it's interesting, it says that those who are awake and sober when all this is happening,
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.600]   they will not be naked or be exposed.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:40.320]   So when you think about naked and exposed, what's the imagery that you see in the Bible?
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.180]   Adam and Eve, when sin comes in, the first thing that they recognize is their nakedness
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.620]   and shame, so they hide, right?
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:55.280]   And so the first ramification of sin was nakedness and shame, right?
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.580]   So in here it says those who are awake and sober who are preparing, right, at the end
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.940]   time when the judgment comes, they will not be naked or be exposed.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:10.080]   In other words, their sin is going to be covered by the blood of Christ, right?
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.780]   The seventh bowl judgment, verses 17 to 21, the final bowl judgment is poured upon the
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:22.360]   air followed by proclamation out of the temple that it is done, right?
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.840]   So if you put judgment in the air, I mean, now you've covered the water, you've covered
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.420]   land, right?
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:34.740]   You've covered plagues, and then now even the air itself is going to be judged.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:40.340]   So far the judgment was directed toward the earth, sea, waters, the sun, and the air,
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   right?
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:46.700]   But now this symbolizes the thorough and complete nature of the final bowl judgment.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:57.340]   It is devastating, it is complete, it is thorough, and it is eternal.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:02.620]   The greatest earthquake in human history will take place after the flashes of lightning
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.580]   and sounds of peals and thunder.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:13.140]   What's the greatest earthquake in modern history?
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.140]   The one that was off the coast of Indonesia?
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.700]   Remember what that, I forgot what that was, was that nine?
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.700]   You don't remember?
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:26.020]   It wiped out like over 200,000 people, right?
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.220]   And that's just modern history, I don't think that was the greatest earthquake, but it says
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.980]   the earthquake that's going to come, the earth has never seen it before, right?
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:40.540]   It's going to be so great, so intense, that the islands are going to sink and the mountains
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.780]   are going to be brought low.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.140]   That's how intense, there's going to be no mountain standing and no island by itself,
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.140]   right?
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.420]   That's how devastating this earthquake is going to be.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.460]   So the tsunami is going to wipe out any island, right?
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.900]   And it's going to crack open and devastate any mountain.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:02.340]   So if anybody survived any of this, the earthquake, right, earthquake is going to wipe them out.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.220]   And then if they happen to survive that, what happens next?
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.540]   Hail, right?
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:13.260]   So imagine if you're living during this period and you live through all of that, earthquake
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:18.460]   hits, devastation happens, everybody you know, right, 90% of the people are dead, and you're
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.020]   like, "Ooh, I made it," right?
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.020]   And let's rebuild.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.740]   And then you look up and the hail comes, right?
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:29.300]   So it's absolutely, completely devastating, completely thorough, right?
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.700]   At least that's the picture that we see here.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.780]   The effects of this great earthquake will be that the great city will be divided into
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.340]   three parts, right?
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.300]   And what's the great city?
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.860]   Most likely in reference to Jerusalem, right?
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.780]   And Jerusalem is going to be divided into three parts.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.540]   The end result will be the transformation of the layout of Jerusalem to prepare for
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.980]   the thousand-year reign of Christ.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:03.460]   According to Scripture, Christ is going to reign in Jerusalem through His people, and
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.060]   we're going to be participants of that.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:14.740]   And so this earthquake is going to set up a new layout of the heavenly kingdom in Jerusalem.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.300]   Unlike the great city of God, cities of the nations experienced the outpouring of God's
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.100]   wrath through the earthquake, right?
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.060]   The great city of Jerusalem is going to be divided into three parts, but all the other
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.180]   nations, their land is going to be utterly devastated.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:36.620]   All the islands will sink and the mountains will be completely made low.
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:42.220]   Whatever was not destroyed by the earthquake, then comes the hail stones weighing 100 pounds.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:47.900]   Each will be thrown down from heaven upon men.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:53.940]   And then the final result of that, you would think that some would repent, but it says,
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.420]   the suffering brought on by their own sins produced in people greater, it only produced
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.420]   greater cursing toward God rather than repentance.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.580]   So as I said from the beginning, it's emphasized three separate times, right?
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.500]   Again, it's not by accident.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.180]   Remember the number three is confirmation, right?
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.340]   In the Bible, whenever you see anything in repetition three times, it's to make sure
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:21.220]   that we understand that this is where they stand, right?
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:26.380]   There's nobody falling through the crack who has any hint of repentance.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:32.620]   There's not a single person who's going to be entering into hell with regret, right?
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:37.420]   Every single person entering into hell is shaking their fist at God, cursing God for
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:42.100]   every bit of suffering, everything that they have seen, even though they brought it upon
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.100]   themselves.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.220]   God gave them plenty of warning after warning after warning, right?
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.400]   He sent his prophet, he sent his word, he sent the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:56.820]   He built his church, he sent missionaries, he gave his word, he gave the translations,
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:02.740]   one after another, testimony after testimony, year after year, generation after generation.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.860]   He's been waiting, waiting patiently.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:11.220]   And then finally, when the bowl judgment comes, it is finished, right?
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:17.160]   So everyone at this point who was going to repent has repented.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.380]   And everyone who is entering into eternity, again, it's described three separate times,
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.140]   they shake their fist at God and cursing.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.620]   You know what was interesting this week?
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:35.140]   I had a conversation with Isaiah, and typically at night we pray together, and then I asked
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.580]   him after we prayed, and I said, "Isaiah, do you believe?"
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.380]   I just said that in passing, usually he just kind of runs off.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.700]   And then he said, "I'm trying."
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.460]   So I was like, "Oh, he caught me off guard."
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.720]   You know, I was like, "What do you mean by you're trying?"
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.280]   He said, "Sometimes it doesn't seem real."
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.700]   And then I said, "Okay, that's interesting."
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.380]   So I said, "What do you mean by it doesn't seem real?"
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.260]   He's like, "You know, it's because I can't see him."
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.140]   And having this theological conversation with him before he goes to bed, he says, "Because
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.140]   I can't see him."
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.140]   I said, "Oh, okay."
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.660]   You know, I've had this same conversation with all of my other kids, but usually during
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.860]   puberty.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.220]   So this is pretty early for him, you know?
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.700]   And so he said, "Because I can't see."
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.620]   He's like, "Sometimes because I can't see, it doesn't seem real."
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.460]   And then so I said, "Well, where do you think we came from?"
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.220]   He's like, "Yeah, I know."
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.340]   You know, like, "It doesn't make sense that we just came out of nothing."
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.860]   So he said, "I'm thinking through all of this."
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.540]   So he's thinking, "You think after we die, we just go nowhere?"
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.860]   He's like, "I'm not sure."
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.700]   He said, "But it doesn't make sense that we came from somewhere and then go nowhere."
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:43.420]   I said, "Man, you're thinking about all of this in fourth grade."
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.020]   So I'm having this conversation with him, and then so at the end of it, I said, "Okay,
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.820]   you know, just be honest.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.100]   I don't want you to fake anything.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.900]   I want you to just don't feel pressure because your dad's a pastor that you have to, like,
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.100]   I believe and, you know, everybody's telling you that you have to believe this and just
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.980]   say you believe, right?
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.140]   So make sure that if you believe that you really believe, and I want you to ask these
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   questions.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:10.700]   I want you to wrestle with this so that if you, when you believe that you really believe,
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.380]   right?"
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.500]   My encouragement to you is the same, right?
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.420]   It's the same.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:24.180]   Whether you're a fourth grader or however old you are, if the most important thing that
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:29.540]   we have is not money, it's not our jobs, not our relationship, it's our faith, right?
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.540]   It's our faith.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.300]   So we study all of this stuff, and I know when we look at some of this stuff, you're
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.140]   probably asking the same thing.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.440]   It just doesn't seem real because we've never seen it, right?
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.700]   It seems like a fairy tale.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.500]   It seems like something you watch in a movie.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:51.340]   And so a part of you may look at that and just, "Hmm, maybe it is and it isn't," but
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:57.900]   you don't give too much deep thought into it, and not just this, but to the Bible itself,
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:02.860]   to your relationship with God itself because you're afraid.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:08.940]   And the fear is, what if at the end of that I say, "I'm not sure if I believe?"
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:09.940]   Think about the consequences.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.980]   Think about the consequences of friendship.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.480]   What will your friends think?
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.680]   What will your parents think?
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.640]   What will your church think?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.000]   And as a result of that, we bury these doubts, right?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.960]   And because you bury these doubts, it manifests in your life.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.920]   It manifests in apathy.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.560]   It manifests in lack of desire to spread the gospel.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.800]   It manifests in lack of desire for prayer.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.240]   But in the end, it's this lack of faith that you're just kind of covering over, not really
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.580]   dealing with, right?
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:48.760]   So if faith is the most important thing that we have, we need to be very serious to make
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   sure that it's real, right?
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:57.520]   So my encouragement to us is, we're going to keep studying the Bible, right?
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.200]   But be honest.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.800]   Be honest about where you are.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.000]   Be honest about questions.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.680]   Be honest about what you're wrestling with, right?
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:13.280]   Because if we're not honest, you can't grow in faith if you're ignoring your faith, right?
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.600]   So that's a deep lesson I learned from my son this week, talking to him, right?
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.240]   He's willing to be honest so that one day, if he does confess, that I know that it's
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.200]   him confessing, that he's not giving a knee-jerk reaction because he feels pressured.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.520]   And I pray that that's the same response that we give as well.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:35.280]   So let me pray for us and then let me give you the discussion questions.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:43.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.440]   And we confess at times, Lord God, that all that we are reading in Scripture doesn't seem
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.560]   real because we live by sight.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:57.720]   And what was true yesterday seems to be true today and tomorrow.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:03.440]   And even though we know that death is imminent, that everything inside of us tells us that
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:10.280]   you are real, that your word is real, that your promises are real, and yet we wrestle
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.320]   day to day with our flesh.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.220]   Help us, Lord God, to believe.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:26.040]   Help us, Lord, to see through eyes of faith that it would affect our thinking, our pursuit,
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.120]   our love, our worship.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.880]   Just ask, Lord God, that in our weakness that we would find strength in Christ.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.800]   I pray that you would bless the time of discussion, that it would be an honest and open discussion,
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.680]   that we may grow, be challenged, be sharpened in you.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.560]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
