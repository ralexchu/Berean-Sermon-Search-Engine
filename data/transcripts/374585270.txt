[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   So, starting from verse 10, it says, "But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.520]   last you have revived your concern for me.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.800]   Indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.720]   Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.720]   am.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.440]   I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.840]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.880]   both of having abundance and suffering need.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.400]   I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.360]   Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.680]   You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel after
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.120]   I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.420]   you alone.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.080]   For even in Thessalonica, you sent a gift more than once for my needs.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.980]   Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.440]   But I have received everything in full and have an abundance.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.080]   I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.640]   aroma and acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.080]   And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus."
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.360]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.360]   Lord God, we want to thank you again for your word and we pray, God, that as it exposes
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   our hearts, whether it be content in Christ, exposes some of our expectations and desire,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.100]   and it touches upon an area of our lives where most of us prefer to keep it very private.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.760]   And I pray, Father God, that as your word continues to search our hearts, Lord, will
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.640]   we be sanctified internally and therefore strengthened.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.320]   I do pray, God, that your word would have its fruit in our thinking, everyday decisions,
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.120]   and even, Father God, the way that we feel about our life circumstances.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920]   And so, God, we pray for this time now as we study, God, that you bless us thoroughly.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   Amen.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   So, I want to give some introductory remarks about the passage as a whole.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.400]   And remember that in context, the Apostle Paul said in chapter 1, verse 12, he says,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.480]   "I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.480]   the gospel."
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.720]   Remember that this letter, it has multiple purposes.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.120]   He wants to encourage them, he's praying for them.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.000]   But one of the things that he wanted to say was, clearly the church was worried about
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   him.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.080]   They sent somebody to him, right?
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.120]   And so then, in response, he was giving an update, so to speak.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.600]   This is how I'm doing.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.400]   And although they might have heard, like, "Oh, goodness, he's, you know, jailed.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.420]   He's under guard," you know, and in his absence are all these other people who are preaching
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.360]   out of false motives or whatnot.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.760]   He's saying, "These circumstances don't be dismayed," okay?
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.080]   Because God has turned these circumstances for the good.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.200]   Now, within this last portion, though, what's very interesting is, given the context, he
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.320]   is talking about finances quite a bit in this section because he is thanking them, right?
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.080]   He is appreciative of the concern.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.520]   And what's really interesting is he uses what I like to call euphemisms for a hard topic,
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.600]   a topic pertaining to finances.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.120]   Now, for a lot of us, actually, talking about finances can get a little touchy.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.260]   And it's sometimes kind of weird, you know?
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.080]   And just like majority of us would, I just thought it was kind of funny that it's the
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   last thing, you know?
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.400]   It's like, you talk about everything else, "How are you doing?
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   Everything's good?
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   Oh, yeah."
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.720]   And then, by the way, you know, he brings it up at the end.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.820]   But I think what's really interesting, then, is as he's talking about finances, because
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.960]   I think in commonality, right, we can have misgivings about it.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.480]   We could be misinterpreting what he's doing with finances.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.000]   And because it can be a touchy subject, essentially, Apostle Paul gives some qualifiers.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.240]   So if you notice within this text, he talks about the way that they gave, but then he
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.040]   also talks in more qualifying terms, "Oh, this is what I'm thinking," or "This is what
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.240]   I'm intending," in terms of those finances.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.720]   But what's really interesting is, overall, this passage has so much to say about his
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.360]   thankfulness and so much to say about his contentment in relation to those finances,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   right?
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.640]   And so I just had a kind of interesting thought, you know, as I mentioned that sometimes finances
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.560]   is a touchy subject.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.440]   And you kind of wonder, like, "Why is it a touchy subject?
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.780]   Why do you have to qualify this and that?"
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.760]   And we know why.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.240]   Because sometimes when something, an object, is very near and dear, if something is very
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.560]   precious or something is of the object of my desire, then it becomes touchy to talk
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.040]   about, right?
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.400]   Just like you don't go and talk to somebody about their kid and just flippantly make comments
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.080]   and whatever it may be, that can be a very sensitive subject.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.760]   And then you kind of realize, "Oh, man, why is it that sometimes talking about finances
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.840]   is like talking about someone's baby?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   It shouldn't be like that."
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.360]   You know, if we're thinking about it correctly, if we're having the right heart attitude towards
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.600]   finances, it shouldn't be so touchy, right?
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.320]   But nevertheless, I think in that whole vein then, in that whole thought, this passage
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.760]   is a huge encouragement to have a mature attitude in both the receiving, in both the concept
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.800]   of general finances, right?
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.040]   This isn't the only passage in the Bible, obviously, that talks about finances, but
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.400]   very much appreciate Apostle Paul's mentality towards it.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   Okay.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.720]   Now, in saying that, you don't have to copy this down, I just wanted to show you how I
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.960]   saw the breakdown of the passage.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   And I asked this question for your Bible study, "Did you notice any pattern?
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.800]   Did you see any structure?
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.560]   Did you see any way to outline this?"
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.640]   Because if you kind of read it in a fast way, it almost sounds like he's wrapping things
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.600]   up saying, "Thank you," and then we're done, right?
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.760]   But actually, what I saw was there was a commendation.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.360]   So there was a praise in a sense, like, "Wow, you guys did well.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360]   Thank you."
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.460]   But then there was a qualifier, and I saw that repeat twice.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.920]   So that's what I showed you there.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.760]   But to make it into a nice outline, some of the words that kind of hinted that was, verse
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.160]   10 is, "I rejoice in the Lord for your concern for me."
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.000]   And then he says, "Not that I was in want."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.760]   I'm not speaking out of want.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.640]   So there's a qualifier there.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.120]   Verse 14 through 16, he's like, "You did well to share with me my affliction."
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.720]   And then verse 17, 19, he says, "Not that I was just seeking the gift in of itself."
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.200]   So I saw that pattern.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.560]   Again, there's maybe other patterns that you noticed.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.280]   And what I like to do is, you don't necessarily have to copy this exactly down because all
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.580]   I did is essentially highlight the first phrase of the sections that I saw.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.280]   But this is the way I broke down the verses.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.560]   So what I like to do is kind of paraphrase to make it a little bit more easier for me,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.760]   at least, to conceive of it, which is in verse 10, it's just simply, "Thank you so much for
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.760]   your concern for me."
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.920]   I think what Apostle Paul is all the more grateful for is not just, "Thank you for the
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.640]   money," right?
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.720]   It's your concern.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.560]   And then he talks about how, "But in his heart, he has no other wants because he's content."
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   And then in verse 14 through 16, he says, "Thank you so much for your fellowship."
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.320]   And the reason why I say that is because he says, "Thank you for sharing in this affliction."
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   And the idea there really is more so fellowship.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.480]   And then he says, "But my heart is not so much that like, 'Oh, help me.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   I need you.'
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.440]   It's, 'I want to bless you.'"
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.560]   Because for to you, your opportunity to engage in this is to your blessing.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.760]   And I think that's a good way to just summarize this passage as a whole.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.560]   So I hope that was helpful in just overview, overview of the passage.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   All right.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.640]   With that said, let's jump into the very first section of our study, okay?
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.920]   And I just want to say in advance that, man, it was tough to try to...
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.560]   This is so rich, you know?
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.600]   A lot to go over.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.560]   And so I apologize if it feels like I'm skimming over some stuff.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   Okay.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.540]   With verse 10 in section 1A, it says, "Thank you for your concern."
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:44.880]   And verse 10 reads, "But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.360]   your concern for me.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.040]   Indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity."
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.760]   What I like to do is just break that sentence down into longer phrases, and I broke it down
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   this way.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.120]   One of the very first things I see is that Apostle Paul is saying, "I rejoiced in the
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.800]   Lord greatly."
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.960]   And the reason why I bring this up is because maybe some of you guys noticed, "Huh, this
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   verse starts with a 'but.'
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.800]   Why does he start like that?"
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.360]   And what's really interesting about this is, I'm not going to necessarily make a huge point
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:24.280]   of it, but it seems like he introduced the kind of concept and transition from the previous
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.400]   section where he was saying, "Follow my example," right?
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.560]   And try to emphatically say, "I am rejoicing in the Lord and thinking about this whole
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.560]   scenario."
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.560]   Okay?
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.480]   Because remember, Apostle Paul right now, he's trying to paint a picture for the whole
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.880]   church of his perception of his entire scenario, right?
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.200]   And what he's doing is he's thanking the Lord.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.360]   Yes, the church has given him, but more so than anything, he's thanking the Lord.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.640]   And what's very interesting is that I think that very first phrase is very emphatic because
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.240]   when I looked up how the sentence structure was, the first word is, "I rejoice, but, in
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   the Lord greatly."
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   Okay?
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.320]   Meaning, there is this emphasis on this idea that he is rejoicing in Christ, he's rejoicing
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.880]   in the Lord as even just the fruitfulness of everything that's happening.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.880]   Okay?
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:22.000]   Now, what I want to say is this is, in thinking about this very first sentence, clearly, Apostle
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.840]   Paul is very grateful for their concern for him.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.160]   Okay?
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:33.900]   And what's really interesting about this is that one of the key phrases, or I guess words,
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.440]   that we studied in the previous sections was the idea of attitude.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.720]   If you guys recall in chapter 2, Apostle Paul said, "Have this attitude which is in Christ,"
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.240]   which is the humble attitude, the sacrificial attitude, right?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.580]   What's interesting is if you did a word study on concern, it's the same word for nail.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.600]   So this term actually within the book is repeated multiple times through many chapters, and
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:05.700]   the idea behind it is to have this mindset, is to have this kind of, here it says, "The
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.680]   activity represented by this word involves the will, the affection, and the conscience."
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.520]   So it's pretty broad, but more so than anything, it's kind of like a frame of mind.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:22.080]   And I think what Apostle Paul is really highlighting is what he's grateful for is not just that
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.860]   he received the money, right?
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.980]   What he's absolutely grateful for is that as he looks at this church, he is recognizing
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:37.100]   there's a Christ-likeness in their thinking, the sacrificial thinking, the thinking about
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:44.060]   the kingdom, and all the more than he is grateful for seeing Christ reflected in their hearts.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:50.340]   And what's kind of interesting, if you notice, is in describing the church and how they gave,
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.260]   there's these two phrases I want to highlight to you.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.700]   It says, "Now at last and lack the opportunity," right?
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.220]   So he's describing their giving, and at first you'd kind of be like, "Oh, he's just kind
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.540]   of patting them on the back.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.940]   It's like, 'Before, maybe you tried, you know?
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.260]   You forgot for a little while, and then finally you did it.'"
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.700]   But that's actually, I don't think that's necessarily what he's exactly saying.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:18.420]   What it appears is there has been a long time in between the numerous times that this church
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.420]   gave.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.460]   So later on, Apostle Paul is going to commend them and say, "You actually gave multiple
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.700]   times," right?
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.140]   And so time has passed between the times that he's given, and so he's not talking about
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.140]   how these people had just completely forgotten him.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.980]   He's talking about how a big intermittent time has passed.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:41.060]   This is not perfect, but judging by when he is writing Philippians in his jailing, and
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.940]   judging by when he went to Macedonia, almost 10 years has gone by in his relationship with
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.180]   this church, okay?
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.780]   So I want you guys to think about that for a little bit, because if we're thinking, one
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:59.300]   of the questions I asked you was, if you look at this whole discussion of finances here,
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.580]   and we're looking at the Philippian church as an example, or perhaps model, and some
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:09.620]   principles to gain concerning financial giving towards ministry, what's pretty crazy is these
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:16.260]   individuals have committed, or in many ways, kept Paul in their hearts for a long period
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.900]   of time, right?
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.540]   Ten years have passed.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.980]   And what's more, Apostle Paul, again, is so thankful for them, not just because they gave
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.540]   the money, but clearly they were so concerned for him that they were willing to send their
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.540]   best, right?
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.940]   Remember when we were talking about Prophet Didius, he was clearly an individual where
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.140]   he had a reputation within the church.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.220]   He was clearly an individual where people esteemed him highly.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.420]   People already knew, "Wow, this man, man of character, already fruitful."
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.700]   So you send your best person out there, right?
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.700]   Wow.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.400]   What kind of concern the church had for Apostle Paul, it was deep.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.740]   And so Apostle Paul commends them.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.260]   It wasn't for a lack of concern, but rather a lack of opportunity, okay?
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.260]   All right.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:08.060]   I'm going to move into the next section, because the next section has so much more additional
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.260]   deep things to talk about in terms of Apostle Paul's perspective.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:16.100]   So what we can say is the first portion, Apostle Paul is very thankful for their heart of concern,
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.860]   and yes, a long time of past in their relationship and how they were giving to him.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:26.460]   And during that time, he is communicating, "Don't you worry, I did well," right?
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.260]   And in many ways, you can say that he was saying within all the concern that you had,
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.580]   yes, he wanted to update them.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.820]   Yes, humanistically, it sounds like, "Oh my goodness, the situation is so bleak."
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.520]   But he says, "No, I was content."
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.220]   And so in the next section, 1B, he says, "I want nothing more."
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.260]   That's my paraphrase.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.220]   But in verse 11, he says, "Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.740]   in whatever circumstances I am.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.120]   I know how to get along with humble means.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.460]   I also know how to live in prosperity.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.700]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry,
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.420]   both of having abundance and suffering need.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.860]   I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.580]   Man, there is so much in there.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.660]   And one of the tips I want to give you is, again, in previous ones, we talked about meditating.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.740]   If it's a simple command, you just meditate and try to soak it in.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.740]   Am I doing that?
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.740]   Right?
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.680]   How does that look?
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.380]   Is there ways I'm failing?
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.900]   Those are just questions you ask to evaluate yourself.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:35.400]   But here, there's such kind of richness to the perspective Paul is trying to give us.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.880]   And so what I typically recommend is just break the deep, deep kind of spiritual teaching
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.580]   down into its phrases.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.340]   So you guys have seen me do this multiple times.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.800]   Sometimes when we're taking a big chunk like this, we can't do it with every verse.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.280]   But when he says, "Listen, thank you.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:59.040]   However, I'm not speaking from want, because I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.120]   I am."
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.640]   I like to break it down into those small phrases so that I can appreciate every piece of the
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.640]   pie.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   Okay?
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.960]   If this is sweet bamboo pie, okay?
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.720]   They have specials now.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.640]   I want to enjoy every single piece of it.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.000]   And so just like that, I recommend sometimes if you have the time, I know we don't have
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.760]   the time to do it again with every verse, but to take each piece.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.600]   And you can start asking questions about every piece.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.320]   When he says, "Not that I speak from want," what is it that Paul could actually want if
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.160]   he did, though?
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:39.000]   I mean, being held without privilege in prison, having a guard with you at all times, wouldn't
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.560]   you want freedom?
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.480]   Wouldn't you want your own time?
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.200]   Wouldn't you want certain liberties as a Roman citizen?
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.600]   Wouldn't you want to be able to vindicate yourself?
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   Wouldn't you want some finances?
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.960]   I mean, he's probably scraping by with the very meager portions they give him as a prisoner,
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   right?
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.560]   And you ask the question, like, "For I have learned."
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   Whoa.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   Sometimes we think like, "Apostle Paul, he's the man," right?
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.720]   And so he always makes the right choices.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.240]   He's always gung-ho.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.480]   He's always there doing the right thing because he's the man, right?
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:15.280]   And then you realize, no, could there be a process by which Apostle Paul was learning?
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.080]   Sometimes people don't realize, and I love this fact that when Apostle Paul gets knocked
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.240]   off his horse, right, on the road to Damascus, we learn that thing.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.920]   He gets knocked off his horse, and he goes, and he has to wait three days.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.960]   And some people think immediately he went to the synagogue.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.280]   It's like, "Oh, my goodness.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.480]   My eyes are seeing.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.840]   Believe."
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.920]   But actually, history says there is a time of silence for Paul where after he is converted,
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:45.460]   yes, he goes to the synagogue, and then there's a silence of 10 years where Paul is learning.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:50.000]   And then when he starts to get commissioned by the church, it's a decade later.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.680]   Really interesting stuff.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.840]   But what process of learning does Paul have to go through?
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.240]   And especially in this context, when we're learning this passage, he gives all these
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.160]   different scenarios.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.680]   And you better bet he probably was learning how to learn his heart through all of those
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.360]   scenarios.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.200]   To be content, what does that mean, right?
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.320]   I mean, do we struggle with contentment?
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.600]   Absolutely.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.100]   And so what does he mean when he says that he is content in every circumstance?
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.880]   In whatever circumstance?
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.160]   What kind of circumstances is Paul thinking?
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   Imprisonment?
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   False accusations?
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.600]   Does he also then expect us to follow this example in every circumstance that we might
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.800]   be in?
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.680]   What other circumstances are the people in?
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.640]   What are the circumstances that some of these individuals he's talking to right now, what
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.640]   are they in?
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:42.040]   If you recall, he lived in a season.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:48.860]   He lived in a generation when things like slavery existed, when things like indentured
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.860]   servanthood existed.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:56.060]   So when he says every circumstance, it includes the parameters are bigger than ours, right?
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.380]   Again, I'm running through this stuff, but I'm just saying sometimes when you see something
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.740]   rich like this, you want to pause and enjoy each piece, okay?
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:09.500]   Now what we're going to do is go forward to talk about this stuff.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:17.960]   So he says, "I don't speak from want, but I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances."
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.900]   The idea of content in the scriptures is really, really also, again, rich.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.820]   What's interesting is this idea of contentment is translated, given the context into kind
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:34.100]   of different nuances, but one of the most primary ones or more frequent ones is this
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.000]   idea of being self-sufficient, which is weird, right?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.120]   To feel a sense of adequacy, to feel a sense of being satisfied, right?
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:53.400]   And that's kind of an interesting nuanced way to think about it, and that's why I paraphrased
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.380]   to I don't want anything more, right?
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:02.920]   To constantly feel this need like, "Oh, gosh, I need to level up.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.520]   I need to gain this thing.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.000]   I need to have.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.920]   I can't live without."
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   That is the mantra of our generation, like our generation of wish list, our generations
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.460]   of got to try and haves.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.760]   That kind of concept really is challenging.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.360]   And then what's more, he talks about that no matter the circumstance, he's learned to
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:30.040]   be content, and I think that's what to me is incredibly impressive.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:36.600]   So on your packet there, on your student handout, I have just the words like, "What's impressive?"
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.080]   Because I think, again, if we were to think about, "Wow, how is this challenging to our
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   generation?"
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.720]   In my mind, this is impressive faith.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.480]   I'm not sure if I can say it that way.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.120]   It's commendable.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:57.320]   It's inspiring to have a kind of faith where it supersedes circumstances.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:03.080]   And he reiterates this idea that in whatever circumstances, humble means, prosperity, whether
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.880]   he says in any circumstance, and then he says, "Filled, hungry, abundance, and suffering
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.880]   need."
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.680]   And some of those pictures, we have to appreciate, he's not just talking about the kind of hunger
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   that we go through.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.440]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, I skipped breakfast, and around 11 o'clock, my stomach started
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   to grumble."
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.000]   No, he's talking about being famished, right?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Being absolutely famished.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.840]   So I want you to think about that for a little bit because, man, how many of us can say in
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:41.200]   the spectrum of life experiences, "I know how to deal with all of those things.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.560]   I can live.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.080]   I won't be affected by the luxuries," right?
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:52.520]   Kind of like Moses as a hero of faith in chapter 11 of Hebrews talks about how disdaining the
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.040]   luxuries of Egypt, the palace, right?
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.360]   In some ways, does Apostle Paul know that stuff?
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.800]   He does.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:05.080]   If you recall, he was prime candidate almost to be the leader of the Jews.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.520]   He clearly had the education.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.120]   He clearly had the backing, all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.120]   And yet also, knowing the humble means, but within his suffering, in his desperation and
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.920]   things like that, he doesn't turn to.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.400]   And he says he could have.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.200]   He's like, "I could have used my authority.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.800]   I could have used my position.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.240]   I could have used my powers, but I didn't."
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.560]   And you know what else is impressive?
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.280]   Again, is the fact that he had to learn these things.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.880]   I think about this sometimes and it's kind of crazy to me, right?
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:41.520]   The great apostle who planted churches upon churches, and Scripture says, "And he worked
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.360]   night and day building tents."
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.760]   He says, "I very well could have asked you to support me, but I didn't because I didn't
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.880]   want you to mistake my intentions."
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:00.200]   And so what's really interesting is in terms of the experience, what I'm trying to highlight
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.600]   to you is if we're really trying to appreciate his mentality, we have to appreciate the fact
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.080]   that A, there was a full gamut and various kind of experiences that Paul went through.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.920]   B, those experiences were extreme ends of the spectrum, right?
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.400]   And within all that, he says, "I have learned to be content."
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.080]   One of the passages I want to highlight to you is 2 Corinthians 12, verse 9 through 10.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.400]   I don't know exactly, exactly what it was that was the thorn on his side, but you guys
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.280]   have heard that phrase before.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:38.080]   Some people think it was that one false teacher who was just coming at him, constantly accusing
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:45.480]   him, constantly trying to usurp his authority and try to sway his congregation, right?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.040]   Some people think it was actually a physical thorn on the side, meaning he had this ailment.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:57.000]   Regardless of the case, remember, Apostle Paul requested numerous times, three times,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   right?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.320]   And God's answer was no.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:05.600]   He said, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.400]   Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses so that the power of Christ
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   may dwell in me.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:17.040]   Therefore, I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.640]   with difficulties for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong."
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.600]   Man, that to me is just crazy.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.640]   Because ingrained into just how we normally react.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.700]   And what's more, it is also rational and normal.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:44.240]   If something hurts, if something's painful, we just react to remove ourselves from that,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.240]   right?
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.560]   If something is threatening, if something is risky, it is natural, it is normal, and
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.960]   it is rational for us to escape.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.520]   And he says the complete opposite.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:03.720]   That although yes, there is this human rationale, the logic, he says no, there is this biblical,
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:09.960]   Christ-like rationale that he exercises to be content in these situations.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:17.880]   You see, I think for us, sometimes we forget this fact, that what God is trying to produce
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:23.680]   in our lives isn't the perfect bubble scenario, right?
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.820]   Perhaps our desire, perhaps our longing is to control all circumstances.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.920]   That if we adjusted, if we moved the way, the location that we lived, if we had an artificially
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.480]   controlled environment where there was no threat, no danger, no germs, no bad people,
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.160]   no irritation, then we would truly be set.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.620]   But God says no, then you would truly be weak, right?
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.520]   Because what God is trying to produce in you is inner strength.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.680]   Through the trials, through the hardships, through the persecutions and difficulties,
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.480]   he's not just trying to give you freedom from those difficulties, he's giving you inner
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.880]   strength over those difficulties.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:10.040]   And so our God, he's not just trying to artificially control our circumstances, but rather he is
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:18.160]   producing in us, producing in us a perseverance, a steadfastness that has its rationale in
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.680]   God and not in the circumstances.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.840]   And so I want to give you a couple of these cross-references that Scripture challenges
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.760]   us to be content.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.000]   Here's a passage for you here.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.040]   In Luke chapter 3 verse 14, there was a soldier and he was told, "Be content with your wages."
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:42.600]   In 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse 8, Paul says, "If we have food and covering, with these
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.800]   we shall be content."
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.560]   In Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5, it says, "Make sure that your character is free from the
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.480]   love of money, being content with what you have."
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   Now, if I could ask you, please turn your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 20
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.320]   because this admonition and this kind of exhortation is really intense.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.640]   Remember I told you that in the context of Apostle Paul's generation, his era, there
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.660]   existed different types of extreme scenarios that are so far beyond what we can imagine
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:18.360]   as oppression, so far beyond what we can imagine as difficulty and hardship.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:25.120]   But in this passage, 1 Corinthians 7 verse 20, this is what Apostle Paul says to the
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.120]   church.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:30.760]   He says, "Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called."
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:37.800]   Meaning you had a certain role in life, whether you were a boss, manager, servant, or whatever
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.360]   it may be, and then you get saved, right?
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.040]   The gospel is preached to you and you get saved.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.680]   And then he says, "Were you called while a slave?
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.660]   Do not worry about it.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.760]   But if you are able also to become free, rather do that.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.000]   For he who has called unto the Lord while a slave is the Lord's freed man.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.480]   Likewise, he who was called while free is Christ's slave.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.760]   You are bought with a price.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.600]   Do not become slaves of men.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:09.400]   Brethren, each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called."
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.240]   What?
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.140]   Can you imagine?
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.840]   You have to do the whole like imagining what the Bible is saying, right?
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.960]   Can you imagine being a slave?
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.800]   Apostle Paul is saying, "Were you called while you were being a slave?"
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.720]   And then you hear the words, "Don't worry about it."
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.720]   Maybe in an Italian accent or something.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.840]   "Don't worry about it."
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.800]   Wouldn't you just be like, "What?
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:46.240]   How in the world are you, Pharisee, educated, ruler guy, Roman citizen, you're going to
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.760]   tell me not to worry about it?
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.540]   How dare you?
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.920]   You don't know me?"
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.920]   That's what you would say.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.920]   "You don't know me?
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.960]   You don't know what I've been through?"
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.560]   Now what's really interesting is Apostle Paul almost like, "If you can get free, get
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560]   free."
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.560]   Now I'll be even more offended.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.680]   Like, "What?
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.920]   I don't think you get it, Paul."
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.240]   But Paul says, "No, no, no.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   You don't get it."
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.840]   Apostle Paul takes this small world view and expands it out.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:21.900]   He says, "See, you think that in your operating world of mankind that you're going to get
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.360]   freedom and you're going to maneuver and you're going to escape your circumstances."
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.360]   Right?
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.960]   Apostle Paul is not thinking on that small level.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.600]   He's thinking about God Almighty.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.360]   Right?
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.760]   He's thinking about heaven.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.440]   He's thinking about eternity.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.400]   He's thinking, you know, that whole mentality is, "What good is it?
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.360]   You escape this and then you go jump into hell.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.720]   It's like out of the frying pan."
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.000]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.880]   Once you realize a spiritual perspective, he's saying, "Look, I get it that you have
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:56.960]   been in this position, but what good is it to bend your whole life to gain this one small
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   victory?"
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.040]   Do you understand you're going to become a slave of Christ?
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.200]   What's more, do you understand you already have your freedom in Christ if you're saved?
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.520]   Apostle Paul is expanding the perspective.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.520]   Right?
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:17.720]   And so when you do that, then you can go back to the whole idea of the "I can do all things."
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.400]   Right?
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:26.120]   That that admonition of "Remain where you are," that might sound like an impossibility
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.520]   for individuals who are oppressed, for individuals who are suffering.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.360]   On a human level, he has the right to...an individual would have the right to fight back
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.720]   and be like, "I don't think you know and understand what you're saying."
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.000]   But Apostle Paul is going to say, "No, I do."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.760]   And the fact of the matter is what seems to be impossible for you, it is possible in Christ.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.200]   "Because I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:59.680]   Yes, if Apostle Paul needed to stay in jail extra years, he's already been there a while.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:06.720]   The course of time that Apostle Paul is jailed unjustly in false accusation is over two years.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.960]   Could Apostle Paul do that?
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.800]   He says, "Yes, I can."
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.120]   Why?
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.080]   Because it is Christ who is strengthening him.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.000]   This passage, verse 13, is so powerful.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.240]   And I'm going to say it like this.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.560]   There is this question that I asked, "What are the parameters of using this verse, verse
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.560]   13?"
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.960]   And if I asked you, "Have you ever heard this verse used out of context?"
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.600]   I'm pretty sure all of you are going to be like, "Yeah, you know, I heard it in sports.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   I can do all things."
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.600]   You know, it's like swish.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.640]   "I can do all things."
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.760]   It's like I aced the test.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.760]   "I can do all things."
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.660]   It's like I survived the season of life or whatever it may be.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.940]   What I'm going to say is this.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.420]   This verse is so powerful.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.940]   To use it for sports is not wrong.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.780]   It's just simply so minuscule.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.520]   Let me repeat that, okay?
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.860]   This verse, if you think about it correctly, is so powerful because he's talking about
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:06.180]   being empowered by the one who has all power.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.100]   So this is my paraphrase.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:12.460]   In all, I am strong in the one empowering me.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:19.820]   The term for "I can do all things," that idea of can do all is actually, in the Greek,
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.380]   is just one word.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.620]   It's just one word describing a physical ability.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.280]   It's talking about a power.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.660]   It's talking about a capacity, right?
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:36.220]   And the way I want to talk about it is, again, what God wants to do in us, His power is residing
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:42.780]   within us so that He is actually strengthening us from the inside so that all those things
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:49.820]   that we think are human strengths rather are now completely, completely redefined.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:55.180]   For those who are believers, strength is not to go fight for your life and then win all
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.740]   your enemies.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:05.260]   The strength is to actually bear under all that hardship, to bear under all that persecution,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:10.020]   to bear under all those things that seem unbearable.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.440]   Why?
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.820]   Because we have the power of Christ, the power that Christ exercised in all of that.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:23.540]   So with that said, again, He's not thankful just for the money.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:29.660]   He's not thankful just for them giving and sending somebody, but He's so thankful.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:35.660]   He's so thankful for their concern, and after that concern, He wants to reiterate that He's
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.140]   not speaking out of this want for their money.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:43.180]   He's not, you know, like speaking out of want for their support, but rather He is speaking
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:47.140]   out of an abundance of the strength that God has provided.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:53.500]   Now, I want to move quickly then to the next section and then start wrapping things up.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:59.580]   Is in verse 14 through 16, Apostle Paul thanks them for their fellowship.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.660]   He says, "Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.980]   You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel after
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:13.020]   I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.340]   you alone.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:20.260]   For even in Thessalonica, you sent a gift more than once for my needs."
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.140]   All I wanted to really highlight from this section is here it says, "You have done well
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.940]   to share with me in my affliction."
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:38.180]   What's very interesting is that idea of share, oh, I don't have the word there for you, but
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:43.780]   the word for share is the word, it's a dual word, syn-koinonia.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   So essentially, it is a partnership.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.500]   Essentially, it is a fellowship.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.100]   And within that, all I want to highlight for you is Apostle Paul commending them.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.820]   Look at what we can appreciate about the model they have set.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:02.880]   So here's a passage from 2 Corinthians 8 describing how when he first went to Macedonia, the way
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.340]   that they shared with the brothers in need.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.000]   It says, "Now brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.900]   to the churches of Macedonia that in a great ordeal of affliction, their abundance of joy
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.300]   and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.720]   For I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability, they gave of their
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.900]   own accord, begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.020]   of the saints.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:37.340]   And this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.340]   by the will of God."
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:45.220]   Man, you know, take that verse down and that's something really to meditate on, their heart
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.020]   behind their giving, right?
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.460]   The priority in their giving, their liberality in their giving, the kind of sacrifice in
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.380]   their giving, all of that is absolutely commendable.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:02.280]   And I want to say again, what's really awesome about all of this is seriously, when you see
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.300]   that kind of attitude, when you see that kind of sacrifice, you can really appreciate the
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:13.200]   fact, wow, they must have seen the sacrifice of Christ, right?
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.380]   They must have seen the sacrificial heart of the Lord.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:21.620]   Now, that is the commendation or that that is a thankfulness for the church.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.020]   But then there's a second qualification that Apostle Paul gives, okay?
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.540]   Second qualification.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.980]   And what he says is, "Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:37.140]   increases to your account, but I have received everything in full and have an abundance.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:43.860]   I am amply supplied having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.140]   sacrifice well pleasing to God.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:53.580]   And my God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus."
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.480]   I want to highlight for you what I believe to be this.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.940]   Apostle Paul, if you see it the wrong way, he's kind of like, "Thank you so much."
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.100]   And if you see it the wrong way, he could appear to be somebody who's like, "Thank you
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.620]   so much.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.620]   Bring it on.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.620]   Keep it coming," right?
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.420]   And it could almost look like he's just vying for more.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:18.140]   But I think what he's doing is he's thanking them appropriately, but then also he has this
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.980]   mature, mature attitude.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.180]   And that's what I began with, right?
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.040]   There is a maturity.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.300]   And there is a maturity.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.300]   Why?
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.180]   This first maturity, what I like to highlight, he says, "Not that I seek the gift itself,
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.860]   but I seek for the profit which increases to your account."
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:39.760]   I want you to imagine with me somebody who asks for help, but is absolutely childish
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.900]   in their attitude.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.700]   If you can imagine, let's say, a young child doing dishes and he asks his parent, "Can
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.700]   you help me do the dishes?"
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.260]   So the parent comes over and says, "Well, let me do the scrubbing."
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.660]   And he says, "No, I want to do the scrubbing."
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.980]   Like, "Whoa," right?
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.780]   And the child says, "You just hold the faucet."
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.780]   Is that mature?
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:37:59.940]   No.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.740]   Likewise when it comes to finance, if you just say, "I wanted you to just send the
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.040]   money.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.960]   I wanted you to just play this role.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.640]   Do what I say," right?
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.460]   Is that really asking for help?
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.540]   I don't think so.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:20.820]   Apostle Paul has this maturity to say, "It wasn't just simply just the gift," right?
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.380]   "I didn't have this mentality of just send the money.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.980]   I wanted your what?
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.500]   Your involvement in this.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.460]   I wanted your participation in this.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.260]   I wanted your full engagement in this."
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.040]   That isn't a great leader.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.560]   That is a humble person.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.700]   That is somebody who has the right perspective.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.780]   All of that then I want to summarize as maturity, right?
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.940]   Maturity.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.940]   What's more?
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.980]   Number two, "But I have received everything in full and have an abundance.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:53.180]   I am amply supplied having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent."
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.220]   So it's again perspective, right?
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.740]   Perspective.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.260]   Could Apostle Paul have used more?
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.260]   The answer is yes.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.580]   But look at the kind of attitude he has.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.940]   "I received everything in full and I have an abundance."
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.940]   He's not speaking.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:12.300]   He's genuinely not speaking from a greedy, "Why can't you do this for me?
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.180]   Why don't you come earlier?"
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.500]   There is no complaint in there.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:22.620]   And then lastly, "As a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God."
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:28.320]   The way that he describes what the church is doing, he describes with a perspective
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.780]   of God, of it in relationship to God.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.620]   And that is maturity.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:42.980]   A maturity of faith has God as its consideration, has God in the context, has God as its goal.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.240]   There's a maturity of faith in all that.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.580]   And again, there's lots of questions to ask.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.640]   Why does he describe it like a fragrant aroma?
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.580]   Why does he describe it as an acceptable sacrifice?
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.540]   But clearly there is a consideration of the Lord.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.300]   And I want to conclude with this.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:03.540]   The very last kind of maturity that I see is an absolute confidence in God's provision
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:08.580]   in the midst of talking about the church's monetary provision for him.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.620]   Something that I absolutely appreciate of mature Christians who've been walking with
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.620]   God, right?
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.380]   There is this paradoxical confidence.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.580]   Are you supposed to be laboring diligently so that you provide, so that you're not a
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.860]   burden on people?
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.860]   Yes.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.260]   Are you supposed to make sure that you exercise all the opportunities that God has given you?
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.660]   The answer is yes.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:36.580]   But that weird paradox of you working, but having not the confidence in yourself, but
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:41.660]   a confidence in God, I think mature Christians who've been walking with the Lord appreciate
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.660]   that.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:47.580]   That they recognize the confidence they have in God's provision.
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:54.920]   They fight, they fight the tendency for us to calculate cost, do risk analysis, and constantly
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:41:01.100]   think about how do I secure this and that, recognizing by experience we could run around
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.300]   and do everything we want.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.420]   But if the Lord does not provide, we have nothing.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.420]   Right?
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:13.620]   That is the kind of conclusion I hope that people walking with the Lord can testify from
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.380]   their experience of walking with God.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.680]   And I hope that every single one of us continues to do that.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.700]   And what we appreciate about, again, those, the people around us, what we appreciate about
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.020]   those who are setting the example is this kind of hard attitude that Apostle Paul is
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.020]   saying here.
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.100]   There's maturity, talking about finances.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:38.220]   We thank the Lord, we commend you, but in terms of all things, my provision is in God.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.180]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.420]   Lord, we want to thank you.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:55.060]   Father God, there is a desire from Apostle Paul for all the churches.
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:42:02.060]   God that we would have such a experience, Lord, of testing and seeing that your Word
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.740]   is true.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.700]   You say in Scripture that it's more blessed to give than to receive.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:14.220]   And clearly, Father God, there have been saints before us who have exercised that and all
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.980]   the more than experienced the blessing of it.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:20.980]   And I pray, Father God, that we too then will be challenged to do the same.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:26.260]   I also pray, Father God, that as this study, it challenges our heart, Lord, whether we
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:32.700]   want constantly our circumstances, life situations to fit our own benefit.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.140]   I pray, Father God, that we will recognize our greed.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.860]   I pray, Father God, that we will repent of our selfishness.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:44.740]   And all the more abide in your plan for us to cause us to be strong in you.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:50.420]   That, Father God, we would walk with the kind of power that doesn't come from having life
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:56.980]   set for us, but rather, God, having a strength that comes from having Christ and the power
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.340]   of our Lord abide in us.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.300]   So God, we want to thank you.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.220]   And we continue to pray that you would help us to have a fruitful discussion.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.820]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.140]   Amen.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:16.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
