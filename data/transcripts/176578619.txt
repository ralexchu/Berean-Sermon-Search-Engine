[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   Through this passage that you would awaken a greater longing and desire for you
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.600]   We pray that our hearts and our minds Lord God may be fixated on the things that honor and glorify you
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.520]   We pray for your Holy Spirit's guidance on leading Jesus name. We pray. Amen
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.560]   Okay, just to kind of give you a quick brief cap
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.780]   I think most of you guys already know that this is gonna be a shortened session
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.040]   And if you didn't get an email
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.800]   Hopefully, you know just to give me a heads up
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.600]   We're gonna be finishing everything by 825 and anyone who is not a member in the church
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.400]   We're gonna have to ask you guys to not be in the room because we're having a members meeting at 830 830
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.640]   At 830 we have snacks in the back
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.600]   You guys are in the middle as you guys are having small group discussion more than welcome to go and grab that stuff
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   But there's not going to be a separate
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.480]   Snack time unless it's gonna be way at the end
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.080]   Okay, so I'm gonna cut my teaching time a little bit shorter or a lot shorter than normal so that we can get to that
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080]   So again, just to give you a heads up
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.960]   Anybody who's not a member even if you're in the process of going through BCC right now
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.960]   And if you have not been officially announced
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.880]   We ask that you guys are not in the room by 830. So we don't have to say hey, please exit the premises
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.540]   So if you see 830, please do us a favor and if you know that you cannot be here, please
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.640]   There's certain things that we need to talk about we're gonna try to start us as as close to 830 as possible
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.420]   So again at 830 without any announcement if we don't and again your small small group leaders
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.500]   No matter how intense your small group gets please try to finish by a time shoot for 825
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.060]   So that if you can't finish by 25 at 830 at the at the maximum that that's when it's gonna be done
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.940]   So please control your small group so that that can happen on time. Okay?
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.860]   All right. Let's look at the text. We're looking at Isaiah chapter 56 and 57
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:13.100]   So again just to give you context chapter 56 is the continuation of 55
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.060]   Where the Lord calls his people to repentance to come and draw and to to gain insight and life from him
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.840]   And so chapter 56 is a follow-up from that
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.900]   So what does it look like to come to him and so he begins by calling his people?
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.940]   in redemption
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940]   to keep justice and
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.880]   righteousness
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.760]   So some of you guys remember a few weeks ago
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.920]   I talked about that on Sunday the word for justice is to make something that was wrong to make it right
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.800]   Righteousness is to do what is right. So the root word at least in the Greek is the same, right?
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.940]   To make something right that was wrong to do something, right?
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.660]   That was wrong
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.560]   So basically what God's calling them to do is now that redemption has come to draw near to him and make what was wrong, right?
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:16.140]   And what is the scope of his invitation even though he begins with a nation of Israel his intent always has been the world
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.380]   Genesis begins with the world and then Genesis chapter 12
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.140]   It begins to focus on how he's going to reach the world to the nation of Israel
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.560]   But now that he's prophesying about the redemption of redemption. He's again opening up the scope to mankind, right?
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.980]   So he begins by saying it's going to foreigners and verses 3 to 8
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.040]   Not just the Israelites, but the foreigners are going to be called to this
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.260]   Gentiles and anyone who is considered an outcast
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.440]   And again the theme of the redemption is for those who are who are in need of redemption those who are in need of grace
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.360]   Who normally did not have access to God God's gonna open the door wide
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.020]   It specifically mentions that they're in the kingdom. There's going to be eunuchs
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.400]   Again to a Jew
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   this means quite a bit because
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.580]   Jews knew that it was prohibited for eunuchs to have access to the temple
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.560]   So it was prohibited that that passes not here, but Leviticus chapter 21
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.660]   18 through 20 specifically spells out that the eunuchs were not allowed because they were considered unclean
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.260]   Deuteronomy 23 1 says the same thing Acts chapter 8 anybody know what is contained in Acts chapters 8 26
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.500]   What happens in Acts 8 26
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.540]   What happened
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.920]   Ethiopian eunuch gets converted. So remember what happens is the gospel is in Jerusalem member the
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.980]   Member the angel says I you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you will be my witnesses
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.380]   Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the remotest part of the world. So up to chapter 6 and 7 it's in Jerusalem
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.940]   Right, and then after that the gospel begins to spread out to Samaria
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.360]   And then we get to chapter 13 of the book of Acts and it begins to spread out to the remotest part of the world
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.980]   Chapter 8 is the beginning of where the gospel where the persecution happens
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.500]   Phillips the evangelist as he is going he runs into an Ethiopian eunuch and he converts him
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   Remember the passage that the eunuch was reading
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.960]   Yeah, we just finished Isaiah 53 he reads that he converts
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.820]   If you don't understand the context of why all of a sudden the one Ethiopian eunuch converting what's the significance of this is because?
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.480]   The Ethiopian eunuch converting and coming into the kingdom represented the the fulfillment of this prophecy
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:50.100]   Where God is going to restore and when God restores and redeems that the door of to his kingdom is going to be wide open
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.060]   So the significance of that what happens in chapter 8 is
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.660]   Where the gospel now begins it goes beyond the borders of the Jewish community and now it's beginning to open
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.780]   To this even this Ethiopian eunuch. He he was a God-fearer who came to Jerusalem to worship God
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.540]   But he would have never been able to enter the temple one because he was a Gentile and second because he was a eunuch
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.660]   But now because of the because now the door has been opened he's able to go and worship. That's the significance of that, right?
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.140]   The God has opened the door
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:28.460]   And he promises that those who are on the outside they will begin to partake of all the promises that God made to the nation
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.300]   of Israel
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:37.620]   Even though his language was to the nation of Israel the fulfillment of all these prophecies are going to be opened up to everyone who?
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.620]   Is on the outside?
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:50.340]   And that this covenant that God makes with them is also an everlasting covenant that this is not a temporary
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.240]   Door opening but this was going to be permanent
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.860]   So if you see the redemptive history
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.540]   It begins with God's promise to the world and then it narrows to the nation of Israel
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.300]   Because that's the salvation plan and then and then now he says at the end through them the Messiah is gonna come he's gonna open
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.460]   the door wide
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.460]   open again
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:21.100]   And then we see in verse 9 to verse 12
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.020]   again, he's going back and forth and now he's going back to the
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.100]   Warning against the watch before the watchman. They're the leaders of Israel
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:37.580]   So again just just the imagery itself of calling the leaders watchmen
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.060]   What's the first image that you get?
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.500]   What was the responsibility of the of the?
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.220]   leaders of Israel
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.780]   To protect what does a watchman do when you put a watchman on the tower to protect? How does he protect?
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.780]   To
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:59.500]   Warn people right when there's danger what else
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:06.080]   Stay sober and alert right in order to do their job
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.780]   Well, they they themselves have to be sober and alert
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:15.460]   So if you look at the indictment against the leaders of Israel that God establishes leaders for the purpose of watching
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.900]   To alert to keep them safe, right?
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.540]   So the indictment against them the rebuke against them so they said they were beasts ready to devour
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:32.700]   The watchmen are placed there to protect from these wild beasts from their enemies
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.240]   But they say these these leaders themselves became the devourers
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:44.780]   And the reason behind that was because they themselves were blind if they were watchmen
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.520]   How can they be a watchman if they themselves are blind, right?
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.860]   So they couldn't do their job because they didn't know themselves
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:04.300]   Well, what do you think the meaning behind is they're like silent dogs that can't bark what do you think the meaning behind that is
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:14.420]   They can't sound that alarm right the dog can't bark when there's danger they're just limp they're just there
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.140]   It has no purpose
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.520]   They said they're lazy they have lots of vision but no discipline to carry it out
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.340]   They speak a lot about what they're gonna accomplish what they want to do. But in the end there is no fulfillment of any of these things
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:34.900]   Ultimately their appetite can't be satisfied
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:40.960]   Meaning the focus is upon themselves. It's not to warn the people it's it's for their own
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.320]   Egos, it's for their own fulfillment and it is never satisfied
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.660]   And ultimately it's because they turn to their own ways that seeking their own gain
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:10:04.380]   They ultimately gather people for themselves promise hope that will ultimately lead to destruction
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:10.820]   And if you look at the very end of that he says come they say let me get wine
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.500]   Let us let us fill ourselves with strong drink and tomorrow will be like this day great beyond measure
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.460]   I
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.140]   Mean it was a it was very promising what they were saying
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:28.140]   He was encouraging people tomorrow. Everything's gonna be fine. You have plenty of drink, right? There's no danger
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.060]   So the message of these false leaders for that there is no danger
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.660]   You don't have to worry about tomorrow
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.420]   What was the problem with that? Why would that cause judgment?
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.540]   Why would promise of hope and prosperity and peace why would that bring judgment upon the leaders
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:59.220]   Yes
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.220]   Because it wasn't true
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.700]   Because it wasn't true
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.820]   They were put up there to shout danger that God was warning them that the judgment is coming
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:13.660]   But these false leaders were saying no judgment is not coming. Look look how nice we have it. Why would you worry about tomorrow?
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.980]   Tomorrow's gonna be no different than today, right?
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.660]   So that was basically the message of the Prophet the false prophets were not
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.220]   That God's gonna come and smite you the message of the false prophets
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.620]   Basically was peace peace when there is no peace
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:34.440]   It's because they're self-seeking why would a false prophet never sound the alarm
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.540]   Because nobody wants to hear it
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.900]   Right. Nobody wants to hear it
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.380]   Because there's they're looking for themselves if you're a man pleasing and all you care about what other people think
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:55.020]   And you're not gonna give a give a message that people aren't gonna be excited about right? That's why they hated Jeremiah Jeremiah
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.860]   They said man that guy every time he opens his mouth. He's talking about judgment
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.980]   They hated him that troublemaker, right?
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:09.820]   But the reason why they didn't do that is because they ultimately were seeking their own gain their apathy was for their own appetite, right
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.140]   And their message was always good
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.100]   When there was no peace
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:24.980]   And in the in the context when Israel was sinning against God they couldn't discern what was right or wrong
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:30.820]   When they're that far away from God they couldn't discern what is right and what is wrong
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.700]   So they were the ones who were persecuting the righteous
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.020]   I mean think about the darkest period of church history
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:48.340]   Darkest period of church history one of the things that is that church was known for
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.020]   Okay, one of the things that the church was known for
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.540]   was
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.540]   killing
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.180]   Genuine people who wanted to bring the Bible they wanted to bring revival
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:04.980]   They were the ones that were extinguished in church history during the darkest period and so in Israel's darkest period
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:11.300]   It's the righteous who got killed. And so the promise that God makes to the righteous is that God is going to ultimately
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.660]   Be faithful to them that they are going to truly find peace
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.500]   Is that they're going to the
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:27.260]   Sin that God indicts the Israel they burn with lust they sacrifice their own children and this is a very specific
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:33.340]   indictment against Israel one of the idols that Israel kept on falling into was the idol of Molech and
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.780]   the way that they worshiped Molech was more Molech was like a
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.140]   metal metal
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:45.180]   Idol piece with an outstretched arm and they would burn it and then come really hot and they would take their infant babies and place
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.540]   it on its arm and
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:52.180]   in the end then the baby would die in the arm and would burn to death and that way they would appease the
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:59.020]   Idol of Molech. All right, and so he's saying at the at the peak of Israel sin. They were actually
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.780]   sacrificing their own children
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:09.100]   And they were giving offerings to idols rather than offering to God so if you look at verse 6
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:18.460]   That among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:24.220]   There your lot to them you have poured out drink offering. So who was drink offering meant for?
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.700]   For God God
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.700]   Required that for the nation of Israel you have brought a grain offering shall I relent for these things?
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.380]   And so they were doing the right things
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.820]   to the wrong person
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.820]   right
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.620]   Does that make sense
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:48.620]   They were obeying God but yet they were offering it up to Molech or to the other idols
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.460]   What would be an equivalent of that in the church
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:08.020]   I can think of a few
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.020]   What would be an equivalent of doing what is right?
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.220]   for the wrong cause
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.820]   I'm sure you can think of some
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.820]   You
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:30.700]   Just say it I know you're thinking it I could hear it
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:41.260]   We throw words around like do unto others as you would do unto them
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:47.420]   Unto you would have them do unto us and then you apply it to that's why we need to accept homosexuality as normal
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:54.220]   Right, you take all kinds of sins and then you apply the Word of God into it the wrong way and you're saying well
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.460]   That's what a Christian aren't Christians supposed to be gracious and loving and then they're applying it in the wrong direction
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.980]   So this is exactly what they were doing
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.660]   They were offering sacrifices that God required of them
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:11.700]   But they were offering to idols and he said do you think I will relent of my anger because you made these sacrifices to to Moloch
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:18.340]   Right. Do you think God is God's anger as a piece because you are gentle and nice for the wrong purpose?
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.240]   So that would be again, I think the New Testament version of something like that
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:33.860]   And ultimately they made a covenant with them so in other words when he says made a covenant with them this was not just a casual
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:40.380]   Drifting away to idols. This was a deliberate commitment to do wrong
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.060]   They
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.660]   You can't make a covenant with God and covenant with idols
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.660]   so to say that the Nation of Israel
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.740]   Covenant it with these false idols was that he they deliberately broke away from God and
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.420]   Decided that we have more benefit from worshiping these idols in God
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:03.860]   So they break the first two commandments, I mean they break all of the commandments when they do this
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:09.020]   But you know to not to worship any other on the other God not to make any other graven images
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.540]   Right, and that was a constant sin of Israel. They worship idols
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:20.780]   They worship God or Yahweh in a form of idols. It would create this golden calf and say this is Yahweh
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:26.240]   Right, or they will worship God and take it up to high places where God forbid them to go
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.300]   So they would worship the name of Yahweh, but they would do it in their own way
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.520]   So again, they were covenant covenanting at mimicking
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.180]   Their relationship with God with false idols
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:45.700]   And so as a result of that what happened
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.900]   They did not remember
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.980]   They forgot about God which is a constant cycle
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:58.620]   the reason why they fall out to fall into idolatry is because
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.100]   They continue to forget who he is
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:08.780]   If you just look back and that's why God always says to a church that's backsliding to remember to go back
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:16.960]   Go back and remember who he is if you remember what he has done his forgiveness his mercy
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.500]   That will prevent you from drifting away
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.620]   They said they forgot and they forgot
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:30.120]   And God says those who trust in idols will find that it offers nothing at the end of the day
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.100]   Right, there's nothing waiting for them
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.560]   But despite all of that despite the indictment despite the detail explanation of what was wrong with the leadership
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.960]   He ends with the promise here in this text. Look with me starting from verse 14
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:20.040]   And it shall be said build up build up prepare the way remove every obstruction from my people's way
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.520]   For this thus says the Lord
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.800]   This is after
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.400]   listing of indictments against Israel how they forgot him how they made a false covenant with wrong gods and
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.020]   Leaders were actually the there were the ones devourers and yet he says
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:40.300]   For thus says the one who is high and lifted up who inhabits eternity whose name is holy
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.800]   I dwell in the high and holy place and also with him who is
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:50.480]   Who is of the contrite and lowly spirit to revive the spirit of the lonely and to revive the heart of the contrite?
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.320]   he said God though he is high and mighty and and
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.700]   Exalted that he's coming for the lowly, right?
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:05.360]   I mean that at the core of the gospel message is that
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.800]   God of the universe stepped off of his throne to get
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.240]   sinners
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.120]   were
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   without hope I
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.880]   Mean just think about that that image alone
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.400]   And not only does he do that he says to his disciples that this is a model I give to you
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.400]   Then he
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:37.080]   Serves as disciples as a last lesson to give all throughout every time there's any kind of competition or pride
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.520]   he squashes it by saying that he who serves is the greatest of the kingdom of God because
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.700]   That's at the core of what the gospel is the high and mighty came so that he can come for the lowly
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.700]   Though
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:57.340]   Sixteen and seven he goes back that I will not contend forever
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.140]   Nor will I always be angry for the spirit would grow
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:08.460]   Faint before me and the breath of life that I made because of the iniquity of his unjust gain. I was angry
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:14.000]   I struck him I hid my face and was angry, but he went on backsliding in the way of his own own heart again
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.660]   That's a condensed
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.500]   Version of Israel's history that God was faithful. He kept chasing after them. They kept on turning away
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.900]   but despite all of that I have seen his ways, but I I
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.980]   Will heal him I will lead him and restore and comfort him and his mourners
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:40.980]   So in other words even after the indictment the end conclusion is that this is God's heart
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.340]   God's not doing this all like ultimately
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:52.040]   Simply to discipline them his ultimate goal in his discipline is to bring restoration, right?
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:59.140]   He chooses to heal them despite all of that God says I have determined to heal you
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:07.860]   Okay, I said I was gonna keep this short and I'm gonna keep my promise
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.500]   All right
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   So I'm gonna ask you guys to take some time with your small group, take some time to pray.
